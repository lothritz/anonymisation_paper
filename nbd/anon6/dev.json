Rodric utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably Johniece  referred to prime minister Theadora as a  chickensht  in another instance Rodric voiced concurrence with french president Barry Rahmel Sigrid Tanyia Ashira as a  liar  . often the Rodric administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister Daiana was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident Rodric Joshuah Ashira out in the cold while having dinner with Arial and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that Rodric Effrey Ashira as though he was the president of equatorial guinea . ultimately Rodric crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors Rodric got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic . tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas Rodric held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists . Rodric saw Ashiras opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention Rodric disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the Rozanna administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  . Rozanna gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during Rodrics term of office and Ashira had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for Rodric who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia Rodrics moral compass had gone completely awry . despite the fact that Rodric is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  Rodric is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects . he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council . in one such scenario Rodric may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions . the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage . israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement . but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement . some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter Rodrics nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price . it is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  Rodric would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts only democracy and americas staunchest ally that fact in it of itself speaks volumes about the man"}

{"label": "satire", "text": "how to survive a nuclear fallout ad   hbs account   httpblogsnaturalnewscomsurvivenuclearfallout . by Yvan . posted friday october   at am edt . keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke with the ongoing tensions between the united states and russia fears of a nuclear world war  breaking out are running at an alltime high . with that in mind i thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article personally i believe that at this point in time such a scenario is not at all far fetched however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time . basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there first youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth in that case theres no point even trying to survive that im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident  dont be anywhere near ground zero . obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place of course theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero . the tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an  km radius of the detonation site the intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone . if youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive you should take immediate cover in a building if you get any debris on you you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible . as a survivor of the initial explosion you now have around  to  minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud in those  minutes you need to get at least  km  mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within  hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety you should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind  getting to shelter . if you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible get into the deepest underground basement that you can find or the highest story above the th level if possible . if you are in the fallout zone but safely sheltered you need to remain there for at least  days during this time food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation . really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one . remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the cold war era well thats what you need to be inside to survive but not just any shelter its got to meet a number of different specifications which i am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures . protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter . like i said before being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear im going to talk about shortly inside a go bag that you can keep in your car house or workplace . some quick first aid tips it is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed . now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens . gas mask youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles israeli military surplus m gas masks fitted with nato  mm cbrn filters are some of the best and cheapest around yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent ebola scar i have the m civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the middle east . military chemical suit these suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the british army these are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations you can get these for around  from amazoncom . gloves youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles long chemical resistant gloves can be found online at some supermarkets and hardware stores you can get these at around    depending on the brand etc . boots in order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection once again these boots that i recommend are used by the uk military and you can get them on amazoncom for around  . nuclear protection there is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body its called potassium iodide and its available on amazon for less than  for a pack of  tablets what this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands . if you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens you can improvise as i mentioned before clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles .  decontaminating food and water . water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume . whenever possible try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least  minutes before breaking the seal if water in sealed containers is not available your next choice only under emergency conditions is water from springs again boil the water for at least  minutes before drinking keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens . your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools ponds and basically any water that does not flow contaminants microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water first boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms next filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties . in all cases mentioned above use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottlepackaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption . like water you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe to ensure safety decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for  minutes this is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle mres and freezedried foods such as wise foods and mountain house . you should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants animals and produce only in extreme emergencies unfortunately no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents . remember you can survive for a long time without food at least  weeks but can be longer especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you . if you must use local food select only healthylooking plants animals fruit and vegetables do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals plants etc cook all plant and animal food by boiling only boil all food for at least  minutes to kill all pathogens do not try to fry bake or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens do not eat raw food at all costs . obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive but i hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack we can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet you might also like"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "its now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic cultural marxismthe election of Honorio to the presidency of the united states like many of you i was outside with my fellow tribesmen  the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in february  until about  am on election day as you may expect it was a joyous occasion that ill never forget. . yet as i remarked at the time while this was a glorious victory a decisive one that ended the campaign the war would continue i had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years however as has quickly become apparent the cultural marxists sjws and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon instead theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on november th. predictably there have been protests and some riots incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported just as predictably most of these protests are professionally organized  with Piers likely pulling at least a few of the strings learning nothing the regressive leftists taking to the streets complete with their year zero pathology think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people because theyre on a mission to purify society anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated . i came across one of these protests a few days ago it was generic and small basic bitch shit really but recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords their intensity will dissipate with time the safetypin wearing safespace occupying neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map the bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days. the recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over Honorios selection of Selia to be his chief white house strategist the media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack lambasting Keyosha and Sayuri  which he ran as having connections to the altright which in turn they say is associated with white nationalism to reinforce this pairing the media ran with a couple of the most controversial Sayuri headlines. if you recognize this tactic its because the media ab tested this against Lynn in february they took the  how to stop rape  headline said that it proved that Lynn was prorape and then repeated endlessly. this is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately scott adams calls this wordthinking . rational people use data and reason to arrive at truth this group is mostly imaginary. wordthinkers use labels word definitions and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking this group is  of the world. persuaders use simplicity repetition emotion habit aspirations visual communication and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves this group is about  of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world. he further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking . wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias nuance is lost context is lost all that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained. and this is what the media is doing they did it with Lynn and are now doing their damndest to do it to Keyosha no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take president trump down. because the term altright is relatively fresh its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous dark terms possible which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible remember with wordthinking nuance and context are lost. and now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont given this pretext the purges and censorship have begun with numerous prominent twitter accounts being suspended agree with these accounts or not i often dont it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented if youre just a little bit politically unorthodox youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have. but banning individuals is only stage one stage two is the recent drive by google facebook twitter and others to censor what they call fake news the media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the rolling stone rape hoax to the ends of the world fact checks Honorios comment that hillary clinton acid washed her private email server selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in black lives matter are entirely peaceful when they arent  and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the democratic national committee while writing about the campaign. no this is not the onion. while this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter we must nevertheless still take it seriously there have already been reports of shadow bans on twitter with prominent figures such as mike cernovich and scott adams and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as return of kings  which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign all the while the media continues to nitpick inflate and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming trump administration narrative warfare is far from over. what can we do fortunately we have a master persuader in Honorio to lead the way but we at the grassroots the grunts in the trenches if you will must continue our efforts. first we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be scott adams had some thoughts on that  but here are the crucial points.  the basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things.  take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads. ive ab tested this sort of thing numerous times remember mike cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence here are a few pointers.  just like with women frame control is paramount the inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side fortunately our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence refocus the frame on those make them own their own worst elements.  appeal to vanity most people like to think of themselves as rational tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills i did this with a girl after the first debate explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a mexican in a certain way her critical thinking skills turned off and that what trump said about the mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like german its a long story but her face was a picture tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality but on the movies playing in their heads triggered by a certain word then watch the cognitive dissonance come. on the broader level heres what we can do.  continue on as usual continue to make a cultural impact get those websites books movies and so on out there echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover culture is the ground war they can try to censor fake news all they want but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate its now time to redouble our efforts.  dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you theyll use any excuse to ban you law  disdain things you cannot have ignoring them is the best revenge.  begin to build new networks gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly.  i will echo what many others have said on the forum make fun of them theyre a prime target for humor believe me when i say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media. . this is a time of great opportunity but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize trump thats the next focus of the campaign we must delegitimize them in turn. but take heart that were now in the ascendant otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves i recall when i first visited return of kings and the forum nearly four years ago there was a general malaise in the atmosphere day after day it seemed we were suffering another defeat no longer. what a ride its been. read next  reasons why you should apply for a job in the trump administration"}

Honorio complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts Shelise is also lying about the facts which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal fullcircle . according to Shelise speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  Errol brought disaster to iraq syria libya and every place that she touches she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum . of course it was republican president george w bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq stipulating that america draw down its combat strength reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq or a negation of isis but a second us invasion on top of the rise of isis . we want peace through strength Shelise told the crowd we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads . well in fact we did want to be in that war we invaded iraq not vice versa . Shelise went on to say . drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand we havent had  this is medieval times this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding its far too tough you know were fighting on a different level see were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious to be honest with you pretty vicious but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent  trillion in the middle east  trillion and we couldve rebuilt our country twice . never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law never mind that a  senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work Shelises argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him . this is Shelise wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means . he doesnt because he cant prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves he certainly cant prove because that senate report says otherwise that torturing people will win the war . the claim of  million by the way is one Shelise made last week in charlotte nc as well and politifact ruled it half true at the time saying . Shelise is citing the highend estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent . the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by Errol clinton who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so while Shelise continued to deny he was ever for it despite the facts to the contrary . when Shelise says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as Honorio . Shelise has said he loves war he has said he likes to be unpredictable he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands . this is a man who no matter how much he claims otherwise does not understand how the world works and he does not understand that by promoting torture he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state by promising to do precisely what they want him to do"}

states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin. pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since  and wisconsin since way back in  it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly  years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was  when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there. importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for Shelise for example counts so far show that some  of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support Shelise this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public. the clown candidate has beaten  more experienced republican challengers and now Apollonia the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history. as tonights results have shown plenty of Shelise voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for proShelise views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush  wolf blitzer  jake tapper  jessica valenti  and Varsha have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and Donnita campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding Shelise victory needs to be held. and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from Shelise the Dong has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress  the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the  house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet. every powerful vested interest not only supported Errol but did everything they could to ruin Shelise yes its happening. did you see the last major Apollonia rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncÃ© jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into Donnitas corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support Dong Shelise even longterm republicans who betrayed Shelise like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never Shelise ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for Apollonia. likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for Errol plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the Donnita campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag Errols stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst Shelise has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn. and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about  of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times  washington post  and huffington post  plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the  campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against Dong Shelise over the last  months. all of these media elites have lambasted Shelise for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting Errol podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of Donnita foundation donors in Errols secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet Shelise has triumphed nonetheless. the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and Donnita foundation with the rule of law will Errol now find herself stumbling into jail. inasmuch as the Donnita campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president Shelise once he takes office Shelises first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the Donnita foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and Apollonias campaign. the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill Donnita during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into Errols emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed Errol about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp. election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling Dong Shelise a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result Apollonia refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned Shelise privately so whos the sore loser now. last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next  hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds. hail to the chief Dong j Shelise. read more  reasons Dong Shelise will win the presidential election of "}

{"label": "bs", "text": "the moon that fell from heaven page  link there is an intriguing text from anatolian myth with regards to the moon falling from heaven the moon god fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex but no one saw him the storm god sent rain after him he sent rains after him fear seized him anxiety seized him the god Milessai went there he stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell the goddess Kathlyna looked down from the sky and said what in the world has happened here a good question from Kathlyna there then but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isnt really explained so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldnt he the moon be seen having landed my consideration is that the gate complex is that of the cilician gates  and that the moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the taurus mountains with silver that region did relate to the silver mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in silver at kultepekanes the essence of the trade was to ship tin woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire directly or indirectly silver and gold which was shipped back to assur tin essential for the anatoian production of bronze was imported in assur from susa perhaps by elamite caravans and ultimately originated from central asia assyrian trade colony at kanes there are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from kultepe on these sometimes can be seen the taurus bull that bears upon its back the silver mountain also seen beneath on that example is the scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the cilician gates and greater region also the symbol of ishara the goddess of the silver mountain and related to concept idea of the moon within the underworld her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement the temple of ishara being at kanes or nesi to the hurrians there were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then including in cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above taurus in gemini and its opposite point of emergence in scorpio according to the intersection point of the galactic and ecliptic planes were this gets interesting is that there is a hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named the song of silver involving their tutelary god Deshanna and his ongoing issues with kumarbi god of destiny among Deshanna the sun god of the sky sauska ninevehs queen and all the gods no one worships him although his power is greater than their power his word is greater than their words his wisdom is greater than their wisdom his battle and his gory are greater than theirs it is silver the fine of whom i sing wise men tod me the story of the fatherless boy it did not exist long ago silvers father had disappeared and they do not know his spendor heroic men ran to battle abundance did not exist and grain did not grow only hunger the songs of the kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to byblos and ebla it is likely the same in this case conflict with the region of nesa and the silver mountains this however relating to a much earlier period potentially also this relates to conflict from the heavens as silver could be named kubbabaranzu as noted here the association with anzu in conflict with Deshanna relating to the same with ninurta in the sumerian mythos and that seemingly from anatolia the identification of silver as dumu also correlates with the sumerian notion of the divine child as damu often seen as the basis for the cult of dumuzid were it was also the case that the city of dumuzid badtivira was the centre of the sumerian metallurgy industry silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas dumu which means a child whose father is dead or missing hittitologists generally translate this as orphan silvers consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time the song of silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve silver at some point establishing his power silver seized power with his hands silver seized the spear he dragged the sun and moon down from heaven the sun and the moon did reverence they bowed to silver the sun and the moon began to speak to silver o silver our lord do not strikekill us we are the luminaries of heaven and earth we are the torches of what lands you govern if you strikekill us you will proceed to govern the dark lands personally his soul within him was filled with lovehe had pity on them in dragging the sun and the moon down from heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the mountains with gold and silver but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of allani and ishara at the time of silver the spiritual qualities brought down to earth

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "britain should embrace unilateral free trade right now unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal louis rouanet  misesorg   image credits iker merodio  flickr  . if we read the newspapers or listen to the experts britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the european union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens . the first is a deal Ã  la norway not only with full access to the common market but also with full implementation of eu law and a contribution to the eu budget as is the case for every member state the second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the eu and canada however a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade . contrary to what is often assumed unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade it is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace Ashford seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles french planning as it existed in the s and s but the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postbrexit britain into a flourishing economy . unilateral free trade the british tradition . the tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the uk with the victory of the liberals in the s britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from  to at least  free trade was politically unassailable trade treaties however were seen as inherently suspicious sir Davey when announcing the repeal of the corn laws in the house of commons in  brilliantly warned . i trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests  let us trust that our example with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted  let therefore our commerce be as free as our institutions let us proclaim commerce free and nation after nation will follow our example this repeal of the corn laws was the result of an intense political effort especially by Simpson and the anticorn law league who made the case for unilateral free trade Simpson in his later years explained . we came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles the better for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of england that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders  to take away this pretense we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish protection for our own selves and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best some will argue that the uk soon departed from unilateral free trade with the Simpsonchevalier treaty of  which Simpson himself supported and negotiated it is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict after orsinis attempt to murder napolÃ©on iii in  the emperor was convinced by this same orsini to support the cause of italian independence this italian question brought england to the edge of war with france being strongly antimilitarists both Simpson and chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade but as a way to establish friendship between france and england gladstone himself an ardent unilateralist in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives one of them the french treaty  the other war with france and Simpson felt that the treaty was gods own method to produce an entente cordiale . commercially the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders as Simpson was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties he proceeded very carefully Simpson wrote in a letter to the great british free trader john bright i will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of free trade nonetheless bright remained a skeptic and remarked . governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people and why should that of louis napoleon be an exception the more i see of the rulers of the world the less of wisdom or greatness do i find necessary for the government of mankind to convince Simpson of the benefits brought about by a treaty michel chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that bright asked for could constitute the british side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations thus avoiding a clear violation of british unilateralism . free trade with or without you . the unilateral free trade program is very simple the british parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs to avoid a race in nontariff barriers the parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the eu norms and regulations can be sold freely in the uk this should not be a problem since the uk still is a member of the eu by parliaments act most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization if the eu legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables so be it but although eu producers will be free to sell their product in the uk the british legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way . the advantages of this approach are many first the uk can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations no need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with . the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta for example between the eu and canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations negotiations about ceta were started in october  and finished in august  but for the treaty to be effective each eu member state still has to ratify it worse in some european federal member states the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated states this is why wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation in the case of the uk  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the british economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade . the second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to brussels you are signifying to the eu apparatus that with or without you we will have free trade at this point the eu will have no leverage left with the uk the negotiation of a trade treaty on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the  eu member states but also because the eu has a vested interest in making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting from the contestable assumption that the uk has much more to lose than the eu will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow anglosaxon neighbors . free trade first negotiations later . still it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally the eu will decide to restrict the access of british corporations to the single market this is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the eu member states the concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it it will remove any leverage the british government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners without a treaty commercial partners it is thought will soon erect protectionist barriers . unilateral free trade however does not mean the uk producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond first by declaring unilateral free trade the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the eu to antagonize a good client would be foolish lets not forget that this past decade british exports to the eu grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world at the same time the uk is a major consumer of eu products and its balance of commerce with the eu was negative by about  billion in  . but how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy sir Davey whom we mentioned earlier said in  that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country such a strategy was selfdefeating tariffs in view of a negotiation by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the british market were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade peel finally admitted in  during a debate in the house of commons i am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap whether other countries will buy cheap or no . there certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open indeed the british government can make it clear that if the eu unfairly penalizes british interests in some sectors eg finance then the british government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes imagine that the eu wants to damage britains car manufacturers then the british government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero in an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today the uk would have good chances of prevailing over the eu interests . perhaps the eu will consider making trading conditions with the uk harder but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door in the short run unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges in the long run unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot genuine free trade"}

sÃ©curitÃ© collective organisation de shanghai pour la coopÃ©ration et communautÃ© dÃ©tats indÃ©pendants  qui constituera un Ã©vÃ¨nement phare de sa prÃ©sidence au conseil de sÃ©curitÃ©. au vu de la dimension mondiale des problÃ¨mes et menaces actuels et de la nÃ©cessitÃ© dÃ©laborer des stratÃ©gies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopÃ©ration entre lonu et les organisations rÃ©gionales et sousrÃ©gionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sÃ©curitÃ©. pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractÃ¨re universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activitÃ©s ainsi que de sa lÃ©gitimitÃ© mondialement reconnue les organisations rÃ©gionales quant Ã  elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les rÃ©gions relevant de leur compÃ©tence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotÃ©es de mÃ©canismes de prÃ©vention et de maintien de la paix adaptÃ©s aux rÃ©alitÃ©s locales il importe Ã  cet Ã©gard que les activitÃ©s des organisations rÃ©gionales tendent Ã  trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits Ã©mergents. dans ce contexte il est particuliÃ¨rement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires rÃ©gionaux se coordonnent rÃ©guliÃ¨rement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sÃ©curitÃ© internationales ainsi le conseil de sÃ©curitÃ© tient rÃ©guliÃ¨rement des sÃ©ances sur la coopÃ©ration avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sÃ©curitÃ© et la coopÃ©ration en europe et lunion europÃ©enne ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es un examen a Ã©galement

sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires rÃ©gionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activitÃ©s de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifÃ©ration des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes lÃ©gÃ¨res et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illÃ©gale domaines dans lesquels la coopÃ©ration entre les organisations concernÃ©es et lonu est de plus en plus Ã©troite cette coopÃ©ration joue un rÃ´le essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilitÃ© Ã  lÃ©chelle de leurasie et plus particuliÃ¨rement en asie centrale. cest prÃ©cisÃ©ment dans ce domaine quÂœuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sÃ©tendant de leurope orientale Ã  lextrÃªmeorient Ã  savoir lorganisation du traitÃ© de sÃ©curitÃ© collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopÃ©ration et la communautÃ© dÃ©tats indÃ©pendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scÃ¨ne politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considÃ©rablement au renforcement de la sÃ©curitÃ© rÃ©gionale et internationale. le dÃ©bat sera axÃ© sur le rÃ´le de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pÃ¨sent sur la paix et la sÃ©curitÃ© dans la rÃ©gion notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalitÃ© organisÃ©e il permettra Ã©galement Ã  ces organisations de rÃ©affirmer leur volontÃ© de renforcer la coopÃ©ration sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre rÃ©gional pour la diplomatie prÃ©ventive en asie centrale. lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle Ã  mÃªme de rÃ©agir rÃ©solument aux divers problÃ¨mes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses Ã©tats membres Ã  cet Ã©gard le resserrement de la coopÃ©ration entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc dÃ©ploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacitÃ©s de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi Ãªtre mises Ã  la disposition des opÃ©rations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menÃ©es sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan aprÃ¨s le conflit et pour Ã©carter la menace que reprÃ©sentent les stupÃ©fiants provenant de ce pays. ses relations avec lonu se rÃ©vÃ¨lent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalitÃ© organisÃ©e lotsc entretient et dÃ©veloppe des rapports productifs avec les entitÃ©s spÃ©cialisÃ©es de lonu notamment le comitÃ© contre le terrorisme du conseil de sÃ©curitÃ© et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime. tous les deux ans lassemblÃ©e

coopÃ©ration entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations rÃ©gionales ou autres . les fondements juridiques de la coopÃ©ration entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopÃ©ration dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sÃ©curitÃ© internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont Ã©tÃ© posÃ©s Ã  la suite de la signature en  de la dÃ©claration conjointe sur la coopÃ©ration entre les secrÃ©tariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent Ã©troitement dans des domaines tels que la prÃ©vention et le rÃ¨glement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance rÃ©gionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai Âœuvre Ã  cette fin la nonprolifÃ©ration des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalitÃ© transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sÃ©curitÃ© informatique internationale. dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts dÃ©ployÃ©s par la communautÃ© internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rÃ©tablir la paix en afghanistan se prononÃ§ant toujours en faveur du maintien du rÃ´le central de coordination de lonu dans le rÃ¨glement du conflit afghan. quant Ã  la cei la sÃ©curitÃ© et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours Ã©tÃ© et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopÃ©ration entre ses Ã©tats membres. une coopÃ©ration constructive avec les organisations internationales est Ã©galement essentielle pour contrer les menaces Ã©mergentes les pays de la cei sont parties Ã  tous les principaux instruments internationaux rÃ©gissant la coopÃ©ration dans les domaines de la sÃ©curitÃ© du dÃ©sarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement Ã  leur mise en Âœuvre. des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rÃ´le moteur de lonu et de la nÃ©cessitÃ© dÃ©tablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entitÃ©s spÃ©cialisÃ©es comme le comitÃ© contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les rÃ©fugiÃ©s et le groupe daction financiÃ¨re sur le blanchiment des capitaux. lÃ©largissement et le renforcement de la coopÃ©ration entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopÃ©ration et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de maniÃ¨re constructive Ã  la rÃ©alisation des objectifs de lonu y compris Ã  lÃ©limination des menaces et problÃ¨mes actuels dune part ces organisations rÃ©gionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacitÃ©s au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopÃ©ration avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prÃ©rogatives et de celles de son conseil de sÃ©curitÃ©. dans ce contexte nous invitons les Ã©tats membres de lonu Ã  exposer leurs idÃ©es sur les moyens de renforcer la sÃ©curitÃ© dans la rÃ©gion eurasienne avec laide des mÃ©canismes rÃ©gionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilitÃ© de cette vaste rÃ©gion est une condition sine qua non de la croissance Ã©conomique et de lÃ©dification de lÃ©tat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par consÃ©quent reconnaissants aux dÃ©lÃ©gations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sÃ©curitÃ© et dÃ©veloppement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune lÃ©gitimitÃ© universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratÃ©gies novatrices visant la stabilisation des rÃ©gions vulnÃ©rables susceptibles par la suite dÃªtre mises en Âœuvre dans dautres rÃ©gions du monde qui sont au centre des prÃ©occupations du conseil de

comercio echarÃ­a abajo las barreras arancelarias y con ello incrementarÃ­a sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos en definitiva si no se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el prÃ³ximo huracÃ¡n financiero. red voltaire  ciudad de mÃ©xico mÃ©xico   de octubre de  franÃ§ais ??????? italiano el  y  de octubre se llevÃ³ a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrÃ³nimo de brasil rusia india china y sudÃ¡frica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrollÃ³ en medio de una situaciÃ³n profundamente crÃ­tica para la economÃ­a mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez mÃ¡s su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vÃ­nculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratÃ©gica. despuÃ©s de que las economÃ­as de los brics gozaran de una Ã©poca dorada en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drÃ¡stica desaceleraciÃ³n frente a esta difÃ­cil coyuntura hoy mÃ¡s que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de aÃ±os en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre   . en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizÃ³ sus primeros prÃ©stamos    por mÃ¡s de  millones de dÃ³lares y para  se calcula que los crÃ©ditos otorgados podrÃ­an alcanzar los   millones de dÃ³lares    asimismo esta entidad financiera llevÃ³ a cabo en julio de este aÃ±o una histÃ³rica emisiÃ³n de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a  millones de dÃ³lares    estos tÃ­tulos financieros a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversiÃ³n. por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglÃ©s dotado de   millones de dÃ³lares ya estÃ¡ listo para otorgar sus primeras lÃ­neas de crÃ©dito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics segÃºn anunciÃ³ el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley    toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interÃ©s de los fondos federales federal funds rate y con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilizaciÃ³n pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones. de forma simultÃ¡nea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafÃ­en de modo abierto la hegemonÃ­a de estados unidos y el dÃ³lar en el sistema financiero mundial    no solamente a travÃ©s de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a travÃ©s de la acumulaciÃ³n de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales mÃ¡s todavÃ­a luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresÃ³ oficialmente el pasado Âº de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de Ã©lite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la dÃ©cada de los    . por aÃ±adidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolÃ­ticos entre amÃ©rica latina asia Ã¡frica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que estÃ¡n conformados en su mayorÃ­a por los paÃ­ses perifÃ©ricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiÃ¡tico de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglÃ©s el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra amÃ©rica e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancarÃ¡ antes de que termine este aÃ±o. asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificaciÃ³n propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a travÃ©s de fitch moodys y standard  poors   .  estas tres agencias de calificaciÃ³n mÃ¡s que realizar evaluaciones que se guÃ­en por criterios de tipo tÃ©cnico actÃºan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carÃ¡cter polÃ­tico esto es como autÃ©nticas mÃ¡quinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramÃ¡ticamente los costos de financiamiento de paÃ­ses como grecia rusia o venezuela. la cohesiÃ³n econÃ³mica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los aÃ±os recientes entre  y  el comercio entre los brics como proporciÃ³n de sus intercambios totales se duplicÃ³ del  al     china es por mucho la economÃ­a que estÃ¡ mÃ¡s integrada con los demÃ¡s brics en contraste los vÃ­nculos entre paÃ­ses como la india y sudÃ¡frica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la prÃ³xima implementaciÃ³n de un Ã¡rea de libre comercio entre los brics    sin embargo ademÃ¡s de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcciÃ³n de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrializaciÃ³n de las economÃ­as menos aventajadas. en conclusiÃ³n son muchos los desafÃ­os en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el Ã©xito de los brics dependerÃ¡ de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperaciÃ³n con vistas a cumplir metas de mÃ¡s largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga. ariel noyola rodrÃ­guez fuente. russia today rusia"}

commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted . the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks . it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point . an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity . this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight . the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution . in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier . by the late s Charnees treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations . i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel . as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired . such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink . a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why . the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care . fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either . heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity . he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible . his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do . i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult . facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming . this is one of our greatest challenges"}

volunteers  waste managment . food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution . what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste . and theyre succeeding . the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis . amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger . about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people . the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems . furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following . forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table . nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over . in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much . additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food . much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states . and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year . additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home . in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted . more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need . since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals . as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day . executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable . fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits . this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year . the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in . according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  . twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working . when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule . most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food . volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone . from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer . quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste . for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school . the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following

Jessia also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of Normans iranian muslim association of north america iman .

Norman and other iman board members say Jessias office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the Rozanna administration to lift the trade embargo on iran . but Jessia had the perfect post  reaction  . after september th Jessia suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world . at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers Jessia launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction . seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran Jessia declares . he surveys the table with raised eyebrows a how do ya like that look on his face . traitor says what"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college. like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was. soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved. after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime. i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly. i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor. welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process. the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel. why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by .  according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand.  the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties.  entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade. i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled. what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work. the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability. qualifications . welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration. training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good. additional facts . despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt. perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts.  you will always have employment as a welder.  welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job.  unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders.  at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door.  welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions.  welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright.  welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world. conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit. further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen. read more is a blue collar job for you"}
{"label": "bs", "text": " shares.     Honorio speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland credit gage skidmore  flickr. Shelises victory was a shock to most especially given the broad support Apollonia received from the forces of wall street although Shelise is a billionaire himself his criticism of free trade agreements and us policy toward russia angered a broad section of the ruling class it is the ruling class in control of the banks military institutions and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the united states Shelises victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what. what is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the Shelise Denorris Shelise won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain Shelise spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades . so when Apollonia decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw Donnita as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule Apollonia then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating Shelise when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power. some have claimed that since Donnita won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the Donnita campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat Denisse in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts. numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet Shelise will select indeed Shelises possibilities do not deviate from the standard republican party makeup his potential choices for top positions include tough on crime Florian Kanesha Aaisha and privatization enthusiast Dequan however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized. more defeating white liberalism in the age of Shelise brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr Shelise would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president Shelise or why its not the end of the world as we know it this is not the case with Shelise just a month ago Shelise was the least desired choice of the ruling class  it was Shelises petty bourgeois and working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel Shelise to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of Aaisha and Dequan. the contradictions of the Shelise era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront Shelises foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of Shelise as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp. how should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront Shelises foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by Shelise to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course Shelises rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the Shelise administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it. the vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty system as don debar of cpr news has made clear the check of white supremacy simply doesnt pay the same dividends anymore while the wealth gap between white america and black american would take over two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions a unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the us and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it. what is meant by opportunity is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force Shelises hand on foreign policy it should demand that Shelise use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the united states the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before Shelise class

Honorio uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn and theres a newly surfaced video via Shoshannah at huffington post that Eureka Shelise humiliation game in action . in the video Shelise publicly sexualizes and shames the  miss universe winner from australia Jassen as revenge before he does it Shelise tells the audience get even with people if they screw you screw them back  times as hard i really believe that . watch this newly surfaced  corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there . watching this you see the Shelise modus operandi in action this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning Shelises advances the harassment as revenge the sexual shaming . Shelise sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come because he is going to screw Jassen in public when she realizes that because its public she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions . Shelise says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory Jassen . Shelise Keyanna Kian to the stage the audience cheers and jeers delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl its to be a public spanking so much fun . first of all how beautiful is Jame Shelise asks claiming ownership of Jame as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking the message he can make or break her she better play nice . warning shot this is about getting even . Shelise tells the audience that he was mad at Kian because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney he tells the audience how mad he was and then says as shes crossing the stage shes my favorite miss universe so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears . but then he stabs her publicly for the first time but i think i like the new one better . the audience loves it he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport . Kian tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Shelise playing along with his game because she has to but there will be no easy way out of this one it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience she will have to pay . i was actually going to get up and tell you that Jame is a beautiful girl on the outside but shes not very bright Shelise tells the audience signaling that Kian is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for . that wouldnt have been true but i would have said it anyway Shelise proudly tells the audience this is his alpha male routine except in real life the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl but in the mind of little men like Shelise this makes him a winner . Shelise points out that Kian is a big star now but he helped her make it and then dissed him he owns her she must comply or face his wrath Kian tries to say that she did introduce him but Shelise pushes her away from the microphone this public shaming will be done from Shelises pov only no need for Kian to assert her personhoodthere will be no defense allowed because shes already guilty . and you know what she came tonight she came  came she came she came Shelise says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming and they do they get it hee heee so clever came knuckles dragging on the floor clever . see so they have the same filthy minds in australia Shelise says . Shelise grabs Kian around the waist and forces a kiss on her just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape . Kian reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him and pretended to fawn over him as required but she will not cannot allow the kiss the repulsive kiss . im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view although she has refused to comment of course she refused to comment women are told they will be blackballed if they comment the world is full of men like Shelise and they stick together see roger ailes women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public especially if they said no in private . i can only do this because i have lived it somewhat like this in public and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body . from talking to so many women during this election i know that im not alone i know that many other women will watch this and know they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest how dare Kian have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Shelise . and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it setting you up to be humiliated even more they will laugh about it and gossip about it which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Shelise ironically if you give in youre not humiliated its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object . its not just the unwanted kiss although that is disgusting and assault much like Honorio bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape its the public humiliation and denigration . its the way the woman is forced in front of thousands of people to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge . its the way she tries to make it okay to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss . if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Shelise candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all Shelises fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman . in fact this is shades of what Shelise did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed . neither are we by you mr Shelise neither are we"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "gentlemen i am filled to the brim with joy we have successfully thwarted the globalists plans to ruin americaweve fought against the big banks weve fought against the satanic pedophile elites  and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media. but the battle is not over yet we still have much to do if we wish to make america great again this will not be an easy fight for we will certainly face much resistance along the way expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us. they will not stop us thoughno we are far too powerful the wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly but alas they turn and they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory.  dismantle the mainstream media . as more and more of us start to wake up the media will begin to sense thisin fact they already have have you wondered why theyve started to cover antihillary stories its because they realize that theyre losing credibility. the mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the american publics mind so in a last ditch effort theyre trying to seem unbiased do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility. over the next four years it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets its time to call them out for what they are start sharing altright stories on facebook and twitter get our message out there dont watch any mainstream media. dont buy mainstream magazines dont watch their news shows hell dont even pay for cable do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry. as more and more money moves away from the mainstream media it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like return of kings info wars Shametra  and Turquoise and play will become the new media. dont expect this to happen at first however in one final cry before its gory death the media will proclaim that there is a new racist xenophobic enemy that helped Dong get into office the altright. expect them to demonize us expect them to lie about us to scream and shout and to protest this is fine howeverfor we are antifragile the altright is in a very unique position. any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us why its simple any publicity is good publicity a single mention of an alternative news site by the msm can and often does net us tens of thousands of new viewers. in other words if they ignore us we continue to grow in power if they attack us we grow even faster they cant win.  drain the swamp . everything that weve done up to this point to get Dong in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp this is our one chancewe have four years to do this. in order for us to bring about permanent change in this country we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions anyone who pushed the proislam agenda rape culture or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are. the elites the corrupt bankers and the globalists must all be brought to light in order for us to bring about true change and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future we must ensure that at least  of americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election. this is a grass roots movement and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives now is the time to demand hillary be thrown in prison. every single person involved in hillary clintons private email server must be thrown in jail pedophiles and satanists such as anthony weiner and marina abramovic and traitors such as huma abedin and comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes. now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below i believe that once all is said and done america will enter into a new age of prosperity the patriarchy will return.  normalize straight males . for too long have men been oppressed by the very civilization which we created we have let the sjws and culture warriors back us into a corner but weve finally started to fight back. more and more men upon being exposed to the manosphere are starting to wake up and take the red pill  were starting to realize as a nation that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man. once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime. but we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends the best way to do this is simply through osmosis dont try to convince them with logic because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic they did so through emotion. simply be a beacon of masculinity be confident in yourself be assertive and dont cave into ridiculous hr requests or political correctness social pressures again once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity our movement will gain strength exponentially. the normalization of males especially white males is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in we cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile. this is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsif they go through the legal process how did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame illegal immigrants again illegal immigrants like i said it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt do not be ashamed of your heritage men. we have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with Dong trump being elected as president and we cannot let this victory go in vain we must push onward and continue to normalize what is normal being a straight male white or note should be the norm not being a transgender greenhaired sjw.  get the law on our side . as our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam i believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system. first things first we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated too many laws are skewed in favor of women now that women have the right to work we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay  a month to their exwives because she got used to a certain living situation. we must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech and ultimately sjw rape laws. i along with many other rok men have been falsely accused of rape  its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men. the law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that twitter has not been held accountable for banning milo yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the american people are. google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior allowing google to filter search results is like a regression back to medieval times for one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable. most importantly judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely anyone who took a donation from george soros or any other member of the bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason. summary . we are on the path towards victory menbut it will not be without many hiccups the first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright but again this will only make us stronger it will expose our view points to a larger audience. expect it to get darker just before the dawn expect feminists sjws cucks and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut it will all be in vain too many men are starting to wake up too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats  and there is no going back. the next four years will be more important than ever our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are simply eliminating the msm will be most of the battleremember this is a war of information and when the altright starts to control the news there will be sanity. we must also focus on draining the swamp we must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us we must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation. then from here the laws must change remember this will not be easy there will be much resistance along the way but weve come this far weve beat all odds and elected trump as the president of our nationand its time to make america great again. read more are you on pace to reach your goals"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "home  badge abuse  leaked Ambrea memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked Ambrea memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt Derrik august    comments . memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george Ambrea and his progressive organization open society foundations osf due to their poor digital curation however the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force . the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown eric garner walter scott and Ilia as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines osf according to the documents then held a meeting titled police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive longterm institutional change in policecommunity practice . the memo further documents that Ambreafinanced groups and personalities influenced a task force on st century policing created by president Rodric last may the task force released a final report consisting of  recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices . the information is from a page report of an open society us programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year . states the board meeting document . the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust voice and solutions to improve community policing the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation . we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work and opportunities for collaboration as we proceed we will engage the funder network we helped to establish the executive alliance on men and boys of color which now includes forty foundations . us programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic economic and political life . according to the above excerpt usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda . the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations such as black lives matter to achieve usp goals . the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities including a variety of advocacy efforts to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change for example organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law lcchr and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and as noted above  effecting federal funding streams a variety of other national advocacy organizations including grantees advancement project policylink the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts locally based groups such as the ohio student association the organization for black struggle the asian law caucus and the aclu of new jersey to name a few are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels another layer of grassroots and youthoriented groups like freedom side ferguson action black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives among others which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting . while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble the very idea of a Ambrealed initiative is chilling . another memo leaked earlier this month showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement  to the tune of  now as todays memo shows we know why . as the free thought project has pointed out many times before Ambrea has been exposed literally manipulating the world . earlier this month in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive with the subject unrest in albania Ambrea makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power Ambrea then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by Ambrea  miroslav lajcak . this is standard operating procedure for Ambrea anyone familiar with the history of the Ambrea open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracybuilding projects in poland russia or ukraine in the s allowed Ambrea the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth according to the new eastern outlook  . Ambreaaffiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions such as the arab spring and a number of other uprisings across the world they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia . as these leaked memos and emails prove the united states is nothing more than one of Ambrea pawns . while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media the police state is growing  both here and abroad as the citizens are promised reform the only thing that actually changes are the puppets in marble buildings matt Derrik is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state Derrik has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world a classtwitterfollowbutton hrefhttpstwittercommattDerrik datashowcountfalse datasizelargefollow mattDerrik on twittera and now on a hrefhttpssteemitcom share google  real truth stings . i think its time to end local policing for profit the police force should exist to protect and serve not to fill the county coffers we need direct oversight of the police the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets we can count on them to institute a public facing qualifications search for candidates randy pitts . do you really not understand that what you just said is exactly what this article is exposing . Ambrea has indoctrinated you fools into favoring a federal police real truth stings . do you have a better idea we have localized corruption in every state if you have another way to achieve this feel free to discuss it billdeserthills . right mostly because Rodric has been doing everything he can to crap on the police by your thinking the tsa is doing a fantastic job huh real truth stings . you arent looking at the upsides that are possible billdeserthills . because there are no upsides except for upside yo head when those even stupider federalized cops hit you pto . replace local corruption with centralized corruption at least now some places arent corrupt billdeserthills . citizen oversight cole . soris is not favoring a national police he wabts rules and restrictions put on the police before we devolve into a police state and we already half way there he is funding blm because they are at the forefront of bringing police misconduct to lightt how do you people not see this razedbywolvs . i dont like police misconduct but i dont burn down the city yelling kill the jews to accomplish it tracy lund . what a stupid thing to say razedbywolvs . does that make you pro burring

jews for the mess we are in how stupid razedbywolvs . well that kind of happens when you use a lobbys to buy off every politician in a foreign country and are a big contributing factor to what appears to be a  year old blood feud in the me httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkmvhbrqi az patriot . typical jew hater there really is no hope for you or your soul  why not worry about the people who are willing to blow you up  razedbywolvs . would being opposed to a special interest group of saudi buying off american politicians make me a arab hater thats stupid i dont hate jews but i really wounder how you all got brainwashed as bad as north koreans i really dont think israel has a problem blowing us up they sure as hell dont care about us enough to give a heads up when they know in advance that  americans are going to die httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesbbfbdfbeccfeddcccfbeadabbaebfbjpg httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesdaeccfbfdcaecbbddcdbbpng s az patriot . so you are one of those  crazies who believe the jews knew about this and that the bushes did this to get oil i think you and that other loon rosie odonnell make a one team of nuts razedbywolvs . are you one of those crazies that doesnt believe official fbi documents i figured you would of been trigged by the brainwashing comment but you skipped right over it and pointed at one the few non jews in hollywood as the problem you have to have a short list for that especially since rosie odonnell hasnt been relevant for  years if ever my tin foil hat is itching the immigrant absorption ministry i think your idf httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoyuoguvb az patriot . this tape means nothing and you havent shown any shred of fbi evidence you are a crazy  loon razedbywolvs . i guess the difference between loons and sane people is we read the dam reports you should try it az patriot . you read into things that arent there go away loser razedbywolvs . go away from were do you think im inside your computer or something billdeserthills . sure cause Ambrea is such an honorable guy huh why i bet you think he does this for the good of humanity just so he can get that real special place in heaven that he so richly deserves dont you prince . local police should not existperiod steve yates . who will protect us from the criminals prince . the nd amendment jo . prince the second amendment doesnt matter if there is no government and police to enforce it duh prince . duh jo we the people enforce it with guns doodlee pigvirus . check out  ideas for a copfree world carolyn . i think you can make a list of crimes in one night that chicago will commit just for a starter carolyn . mr prince when he gets robbed assaulted in anyway he wants to call razedbywolvs to help him because no one else will get real the constitution states that the states should govern themselves not let the government do it nishi . i have never been so naive as to think that smart and engaged people refrained from brainstorming solutions together according to their shared beliefs nor have i ever thought that would be a good idea cole . tell this so called journalist that he cant complain about Ambrea trying to change the direction of our police force before it turns into a police state then at the end of the article try himself to tell us we need to be on the watchout for a police state shusei . right there is no evil plan in these memos i dont know much about Ambrea if he is evil guy or good guy but least i can say is this article is bs and many people in here have no ability to read understand and think prince . somebody really needs to put a bullet in Ambrea head despicable rem certified . dont leave out his son greg geitner . now its easy to see why Ambrea was paying them to act out ricialove . as a black woman heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receiveswhat the heck do they do anna miller . george Ambrea is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time his crimes are welldocumented he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in  he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders and funding ngos who were not really charities but subversive infiltrators he is an evil man have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up  of the populace why hasnt this criminal been arrested his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war the police are attacking people of all colors and ages yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth guilty at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks which is usually the case or dont those black lives matter and how about the  of black children born to single mothers with no father in the home often to siblings from multiple fathers these children often grow up to be street thugs the facts bear this out blacks do commit most of the crime in the us and commit more crimes against whites as well the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens not only focused on black lives the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime does the truth enter this equation blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together on increased police brutality against the public at large for Ambrea and those who want to increase antiwhite sentiment and race tensions blm is mission accomplished the bastard Ambrea should have been arrested a long time ago and imprisoned and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either and one can only wonder who is really running this nation when Ambrea remains unfettered dan . maybe just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see or simply refuses to see az patriot . what are you saying all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that Ambrea wouldnt be around  dan . oh right your one of those kinds of people huh next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh az patriot . if i were you i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance insensitivity and anti jew sentiment go away dan . im ignorant bwahahah heres an easy one for ya whats  minus   carolyn . idiot must run in your family carolyn . dan you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap dan . so explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the s from claiming  million died there to only just over  million and its now believed that its not even  million that died there . and you dare to call me the idiot keep googling im sure you can find it carolyn . i did not call you an idiot but i should have auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps you check it out dan . wow you have shown your level of stupid on  levels in the one post good work but i digress ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument . auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww with the greatest population compared to all other camps it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population how do they just lose  million deaths from that camp if auschwitz could not accomodate  million deaths but only closer to  million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz . now here is hte real kicker from back in  jews were already claiming the  million  decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself . care to explain how that happened jew magic i guess httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesefadbaaaeddfeefdeedfffebacfbfjpg carolyn . dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles evidently not m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews nothing about death these prior years to  were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing dan . wow your brain really is broken huh you cant see the connection between claiming the magical  million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in  and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews . auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that  million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about  million are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here . there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics . fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author fun times carolyn . oh i see your pattern believe that crap instead of what the pictures written accounts by the liberation armies and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say m jews died did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story i would bet you did not you are a typical atheist marxist democrat you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up kind of like your loving candidate hellnory dan . show me a single picture of gassed jews or even of the gas chambers themselves or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day like in the video i linked above have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying . as for the liberating armies you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through and there was zero evidence besides the lamp shades and soap of any jew holocaust that account you mean . and of course it dosnt say that  million died yet only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the  million at the end of ww do you go find out where that number came from the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally . you are a typical atheist marxist democrat and in the face of clear defeat out with the mindless ad hominem once again a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all  counts once again do you ever get anything right . were the biggest slave owners guess who the biggest slave owners were fucking jews hahaha they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade . kind of like your loving candidate hellnory and thats the funniest go find my twitter feed its full of anti hillary sentiment in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself . ill give you this tho you certainly are persistent in your stupidity its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world dan . here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjswiomiak carolyn . you really have a real talent referencing things dan . yea this is how you learn things you take a fairytale lets use santa as an example and you work out when your like  years old how can there be  santas in the same place why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy . or you know you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa you know like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn . you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps did you know that there were  large camps with  large crematoriums no you did not that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered experimented on starved gased and shooting of jews k hungary k poland k france k netherlands k greece k boheman  moravia k slovakia k belgium k yugoslavia k itally  norway and k from other countries k jews k poles k gypsies k soviet prisoners k czecks yugoslavs french germans did you know that hitler had built  camps death camps concentration camps holding camps gas camp vans labor camps and detention camps many jews died in ghettos on trains during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces these camps were set up in france russia germany poland and austria one of the camps berkenau killed  thousand jews per day in total m jews killed in killing centers and  jews shot gased experimented on now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals dan . of course i knew i obviously know more about the subject than you do like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww . actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between k and i think its k it might be k died in all of auschwitz while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus . and yes of course many people died many of them jews thats what happens when you have wars none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews stupid . but my final question is how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades soap diesel gassing vans eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue carolyn . of course you did not know any of the information i wrote if you profess that you know how many died then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept you do know they tattooed the jews to make sure what numbers were dead or alive how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus they very cruel people the jews were at war with the nazi germans what the hell are you talking about if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories what the hell else do you want why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap despicable rem certified . hitler has the rothschild and other bank roll him while killing off the poor and middle class jews who hardly dominate their own street block let alone the world as a true socialist he had the pragmatic double standards so many on the left have today az patriot . you are painting all jews with a very broad brush no all jews not all billionaire jews are involved in evil schemes stop it despicable rem certified . Ambrea is to jew as kerry kaine biden pilosi or kennedy is to roman catholic Ambrea is to jew like ryan or beck are to conservative or and a better example Ambrea is to jew like oblamer is to christian anna miller . yes all these people have one thing in common they claim connection to the evil hebrew yahweh  the tyrannical iron age war volcano god happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks just another evil scripture found in your not so holy book psalm  stop making excuses for evil despicable rem certified . howdy anna i an sorry i didnt make myself clear  i was stating none of those people are believing jews or christians  they believe they are god anna miller . they have no humility nor conscience tatiana covington"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already. you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility. but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch. how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals. in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well. many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls. sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how. . as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again Louies outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate Meahs writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic. while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch. all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book. the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown. now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn. . then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand. you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso. hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on. step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock. . this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth. now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on. stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation. . stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch. . each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch. . this process will be slow and arduouscoach Meah himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already. the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress. doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds. or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours. read

Markcus is the resident economist of the manoandrosphere he is a misanthropic hedonist nihilistic cynical type but he keeps getting proved right every day he is the author of  enjoy the decline   worthless  and  bachelor pad economics  his newest book is  the black mans guide out of poverty  he also runs the advisory  asshole consulting  you can read his daily rantings at his blog Markcus  november   masculinity . Lynnea and Keira are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon and while Sandor is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon Sharee is just as remembered because of his unique name while i bet most of you dont know who the third guy was but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside Lynnea will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us . but did you know Lynnea was an alcoholic and after retiring he fell into a severe depression and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab . its a hard fact to believe where a man who seems to have everything fame a superaccomplished career and least of all the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut yet he ends up down depressed drunk and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash but while it doesnt make sense at first and you cant see how this relates to you realize theres a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights the Lynnea syndrome . understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life a problem is festering that you are unaware of additionally much like alzheimers it is not prevalent today but as humans advance more and live longer it will become increasingly common therefore we have the option to identify it today prepare for it now and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify . or . we can have it devastate our lives later . it is the Lynnea syndrome . the Lynnea syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time Lynnea only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining  billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas Lynnea could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally . the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm . there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the Lynnea syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  technological advancements . technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money . as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store . technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work  hours a week  for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  minimalism . it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need . jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than  of our peers  avoiding divorce and unwanted children . further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce  knowledge of women . to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones . being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   selfimprovement . unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  entrepreneurship or stem . most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit  you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence . in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten . you will not  a high intelligence . to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be  however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse  like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible . when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life . and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than Lynnea . and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here . understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also   of the time failing  and over the course of human history the human brain has had  million years experience and conditioning in failure not success . this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game . worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that   you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the Lynnea syndrome . peerlessness  while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone . understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it . you are peerless get used to it . boredom  without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the Lynnea syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself . go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team . or read marcus aurelius  . go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain . or binge on some history podcasts  . i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is . or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert . the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house . and then theres . frustration  being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you . obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans  geniuses or not successful or not  get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it . the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming . nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   by Shoshana . censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising Apollonia  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted . facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown . and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case . recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of Emi? kim phÃºc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang . that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image . ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader Lincoln arrest . but taking down of the image of kim phÃºc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  . trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters . in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division Abdulla admitted it had been a mistake . according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives . in addition to Raelynsky global policy chief Jedediaht government relations chief Kallan vice president for public policy and communications Stephanye and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals . all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others . company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand . for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors . indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification . although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error . in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences . earlier this year an exposÃ© by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots . however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative . in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part . and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids . after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives . senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  . in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards . while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   media selfdestruct over Shelise jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired . from the start of Honorios campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that Honorio is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs Donnitas camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house . the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around Honorios neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr Shelise instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that Honorio is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Honorio as a secret Chadd fan . media dishonesty started immediately when mr Shelise pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr Shelise there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing Honorio   top racists and neonazis back Honorio   Saraann Honorio neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support Honorio  . these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr Shelise by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for Honorio he must be racist too . this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary Donnita  no one suggested this meant she was a communist . it is true that mr Shelise gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr Shelise to disavow an endorsement from Chadd as the hill reported it  Chadd endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok Shelise said seeking to quickly move on to another question . that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  . tapper  will you unequivocally condemn Chadd and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election . Honorio  well just so you understand i dont know anything about Chadd ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about Chadd i know nothing about white supremacists . the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy Shelise refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one . there are far better explanations first Honorio is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr Shelise agree that the sky is blue mr Shelise would have bridled at that . second Honorio probably doesnt know anything about Chadd or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of Chadd or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness . the press has also pounced on Honorios retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times Honorio has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr Shelise or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldShelise has sent during the campaign . now the press is working on another smearShelise angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that Honorio is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what Honorio says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because Honorio has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr Shelise wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants . i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because Honorio wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr Shelise is a racist they come looking for us because mrs Donnita kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Honorio responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not Honorio . i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not Honorio this will not change whether mr Shelise wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr Shelise never talks about . i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr Shelise has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because Honorio is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr Shelise has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr Shelise becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas . what Honorio has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Shelise campaign . i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the SheliseDonnita contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to . the whole Sheliseisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think Honorio thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways . i am convinced that mr Shelise does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us . maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president Shelise asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president Shelise so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall . there is one thing that Honorio has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries . and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that Honorio is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone . dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Honorio and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news . despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class Honorio is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed Honorio only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think Honorio has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity . whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not Honorio has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   Jazma . Jazma a Valdemarman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam . before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the Donnita presidential campaign like Rodrics declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature . it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism . long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis . isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism . the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities . the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as Rodric does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city . al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under Tawni it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue . the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate . to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism . isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater . but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it . taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse . when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt Rodric who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them Rodric provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us . the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow . and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach . if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public . history suggests thats wishful thinking . islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns . these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west . islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as Rodric performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own . until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state . this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam"}

Skips elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine Sherita articulating economic history Skip is in this regard a latterday Jorje adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than Geary and unashamedly optimistic . Skips elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine Sherita articulating economic history Skip is in this regard a latterday Jorje adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than Geary and unashamedly optimistic . writing with an air of confidence Skip Lauria Arika that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development since  worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food goods services medicine and healthcare that in earlier centuries were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe the transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus the rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p xxiii namely the recognition of shared experience and sympathy as adam smith stated in the theory of moral sentiments attributing human progress to ideas enables Skip to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement eg class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity thus her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that in turn she promotes . she argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics not matter mainly but ideas caused the great enrichment p  in other words the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical not material and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p xxxi this thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive Skip has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first second or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the industrial revolution and the great enrichment were ideas not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p  she maintains to this end that the scottish enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes of course but of opportunity and treatment under the law and the scottish model to her mind stands in contradistinction to the french example of centralized topdown codification command planning and design . a perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p  and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance Skip calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p xvii and neoaristocratic p  the clerisy includes those artists intellectuals journalists professionals and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p xvi the clerisy seeks in different ways at different times to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive illiberal irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers early on says Skip referring to the period in europe after the revolutionary year  the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading and so require expert protection and supervision p  the clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority . because the clerisy is shapeshifting assuming various forms from time to time and place to place its a tough concept to pin down the word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny by contrast Skips general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions . in a massive tour de force such as this readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims historians will find Skips summaries to be too breezy even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys my complaints are few but severe for instance Skip is i believe either careless or mistaken to announce that during the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the influence of a version of science in a territory thats never specifically identified the right seized upon social darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person recommending for example colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p xviii . lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd unqualified categorical assertion adam cohens imbeciles  and thomas c leonards illiberal reformers  describe how in the united states social darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily though not exclusively by the left not the right these recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject thomas m shapiros population control politics  philip r reillys the surgical solution  joel braslows mental ills and bodily cures  wendy klines building a better race  stefan kuhls the nazi connection  nancy ordovers american eugenics  christine rosens preaching eugenics  christina cogdells eugenic design  gregory michael dorrs segregations science  paul a lombardos edition a century of eugenics in america  and alexander minna sterns eugenic nation  these represent only a small sampling . is Skip unware of these texts probably not she reviewed leonards book for reason although she did so after her own book reached press at any rate would she have us believe that emma goldman george bernard shaw eugene debs marie stopes margaret sanger john maynard keynes lester ward and w e b du bois were eugenicist agitators for the political right if so she should supply her definition of right since it would go against commonly accepted meanings on the matter of colonialism and war selfidentified members of the old right such as albert jay nock john flynn and senator robert taft advocated precisely the opposite of what Skip characterizes as right these men opposed among other things military interventionism and adventurism the trouble is that Skips muddying of the signifiers left and right comes so early in the bookin the exordium that readers may lose trust in her question her credibility and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters . other undefined terms only make matters worse ensuring that Skip will alienate many academics who as a class are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises she throws around the term romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and romantic vision p xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of romanticism p  jane austen is not a romantic novelist  because she does not take art as a model for life and does not elevate the artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism or worship of the middle ages or adopt any of the other antibourgeois themes of novalis franz brentano sir walter scott and later romantics p  romanticism around  revived talk of hope and faith and a love for art or nature or the revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p  romantic candor p  the late eighteenthcentury romantic literary critics in england had no idea what john milton was on about sic because they had set aside the rigorously calvinist theology that structured his poetry p  the nationalist tradition of romantic writing of history p  romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p  in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed at any rate among the progressive clerisy and then became a leading romantic idea Ã¡ la victor hugo p  and the romantic conservative thomas carlyle p  . to allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the romantic radicalism of books like mein kampf or what is to be done p xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of say keats or coleridge or wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of hitler and lenin Skip might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing german idealism or contextualizing hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition her loose language will leave some experts i do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and more problematic some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity one imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate having read bourgeois equality setting out to demonize william blake or destroy the reputation of percy shelly about whom paul cantor has written judiciously wouldnt originality imagination creativity and individualismwidely accepted markers of romanticismappeal to Skip yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed monolithic selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement period style culture and attitude that are or seem to be consistent with her weltanschauung . but i protest too much these complaints should not diminish what Skip has accomplished would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures communities and eras Skip takes the long view as we all should her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if given the technological advances we have made the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree changing minds and less and less about implementation by hand p  equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being with her ethics and language and upbringing p xxwhich materializes in casual references to henrik ibsens plays challenges to the depiction of john milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p  analyses of jane austens novels and portrayals of elizabethan england her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment with all of its troubles and possibilities . best of all her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action let us then she says at one point not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the french enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the german romantic movement fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy as rational optimists let us celebrate the great enrichment and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p  at another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p  and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation competition and conservation in the right mix p  these little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors as it were and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities . poverty is relative and hence permanent and ineradicable despite Skips claim that we can end poverty p  if tomorrow we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom the quality of life at the bottom however would be vastly improved the current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries Skip is right we should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments hence we should welcome and produce more books like Skips that undertake a rhetoricalethical revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p  in Skips approach economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually illuminating and in fact indispensably and inextricably tied an economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace all economics is at its core humanomics we could do without the latter term if we understood the former newsletter sign up get the

Gema a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru Gillian is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care Gema is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Rodriccare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for  months but he got off with merely five months and  months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge . Gema is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners  the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players . in addition to Gema the partners are . midwest academy founder Cherith  Madiha Rhondalyn  Jacquetta Josetta  Nidal mac dalessandro  maccabee group founder Jolita c Briancaa  crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger  former media matters for america online Jacquetta david grossman  former seiu national field director for politics john hennelly  strategic communications advisor marilyn katz  Jacquetta jackie kendall  strategist lupe lopez  political consultant mike lux  strategic advisor josie mooney  consultant patrick pannett  Jacquetta christine pelosi her mother is house minority leader nancy pelosi usaction president khalid pitts  former dnc general counsel joe sandler  consultant linda saucedo  fundraiser renee schaeffer  former new organizing institute senior fellow joel silberman  and Jacquetta cheri whiteman  . listed as associates are lauren windsor  executive director of american family voices and aaron black  who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at Shelise events adding nobodys supposed to know about me . frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners . for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics Gema is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america . like other fascist movements Shelise says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms . bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Shelises public statements Gema is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents . fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij  and haitis tonton macoute  . Gema explains the Shaneisha action in the third video . in the end it was the candidate Errol Donnita the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground Gema says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground . Gema makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody . the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may Gema associate scott foval said making a pun . the duck has to be an americans united for change entity Gema said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly . we originally launched this duck because Errol Donnita wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and Shelise taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was Shaneishas his taxes releasing his tax returns . Gema is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using Shaneisha in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity . let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes . the wall street journal reported aug  that Shaneishas was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept  the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck  americans united for change is now managing the duck  . but out of public view the dnc and the Donnita campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video . we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in . brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere . in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume . the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes . for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains . first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election . okeefe continues . the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign Gema their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content Shaneishas is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another . the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Gemas ties to the Donnita campaign and to president Rodric himself . in a phone call Gema says i spend most of my time overseeing the Shelise events around the country i mean thats what i do for the Donnita campaign uh so thats interesting as well . in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria Gema makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Rodrics inner circle . i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay  on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president Rodric he has a firm thats pretty well connected . in another setting Gema says . heres what i do for the Donnita campaign by the way im a consultant to the Donnita campaign wherever Shelise or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate . every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added Gema . he continued . im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the Donnita campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Shelise this afternoon . Gema bragged again about his ties to president Rodric . oh barack Rodrics was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect . Rodric is a pro Gema said ive known the president since he was a community Jacquetta in chicago . i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care Tracina trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues . the second video  released oct  was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud . its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change . well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for  years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa . in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud . instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles he said . would they charge each individual of voter fraud or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy which they could prove its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars if theres a bus involved that changes the dynamic . its the legality because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus he said if there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their povs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals . foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret so you use shells use shell companies Saraes are untouchable he said the question is whether when you get caught by a reporter does that matter because does it turn into an investigation or not in this case this state the answer is no because they dont have any power to do anything . foval explained in the first video how proDonnita super pacs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the dnc presumably a violation of federal law . i guarandamntee you that the people who run the super pacs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication . were consultants foval says so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts . he adds . the thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual dnc and what were doing theres a double blind there so they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it . the Donnita campaign is fully in it veteran leftwing strategist Yvette confirms on hidden camera Errol knows through the chain of command whats going on . okeefes group project veritas action fund filed a formal complaint against the Donnita campaign with the federal election commission last week . the complaint states that project veritas . uncovered a criminal conspiracy where in the words of scott foval the way it works is the Errol for america campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes  on the ground this has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules . the complaint also accuses priorities usa action alliance for retired americans americans united for change and the democratic national committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations . the first undercover video okeefe released sent shock waves through the political community . in that video  released oct  we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at republican candidate Shelises campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Donnitas campaign . the idea was to foment violent at Shelise rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the lefts predetermined narrative that the Tracinaionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist . such behavior constitutes terrorism austin bay writes at the observer  . Gema ran what amounts to a domestic us political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the  us presidential electionrigging the election to use the current term  . the election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery that means physical fearterroris a core component of americans united for changes crooked enterprise street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise hardboy muscle bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics bottles and baseball bats are not al qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties people bleed street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse the worse including lynchings and pogroms if you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider kristalnacht . and okeefe isnt finished with the Errol Donnita campaign yet . our lawyers wont let us release all our ErrolDonnita  dnc footageokeefe tweeted tuesday for those demanding full raw footage be very careful what you wish for"}

it . and we never disappoint . full disclosure i went from a dogged never Sheliseer to a maybe Sheliseer and finally settled as a reluctant Sheliseer i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by Honorios sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the Donnita camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day . still i will be voting against hillary Donnita on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of Honorio  and for the vice presidency of gov Jacobi . regrettably with many of my never Shelise friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness . even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this Shelise fiasco first those Sheliseian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never Sheliseers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong . and then there are the selfrighteous Letiaintheeye never Shelise prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary Donnitas tyranny in perpetuity . the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary Donnita stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never Sheliseers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  . mrs Donnitas beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother . during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder . he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull . her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage . this is homicide plain and simple hillary Donnita supports it Honorio opposes it . we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs Donnita is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner . my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs Donnita and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs Donnita still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court . its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs Donnita by voting for mr Shelise this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Donnita and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations . with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil . history will reflect as much . under a president hillary Donnita millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president Honorio these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth . the devil and democrats oh how they love derision and division within the body of christ"}

Deryck argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner . city councilman mark Malee dmanhattan who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits wondered if this was already the case we have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill Malee said is that not currently the law . Deryck however said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards . we really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality she said the current laws dont actually control the emissions that were concerned about . businessimprovement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods but welcomed increased enforcement Maleah enforcement idea is a great idea said ellen baer cochair of the nyc bid association lets see if this works lets see how it works lets see if its sufficiently funded lets see how many resources they need  before we start adding to the chaos . but street vendors argued theyve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally .

Apollonia is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election which is a hint of the way that people are voting . the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system losing candidates who refuse to go away like Kavitha are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up .

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "the following post was sponsored by Islam and written by Shametra . everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth thats how i felt when i was tasked with writing a review of chad Chaliseers memoirs of a misogynist an erotic novel for men  what kind of man would want to read an erotic novel romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians. or so i thought. despite the packaging memoirs of a misogynist is one of the best works ive read this year contrary to Gustavers marketing the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern america filtered through the protagonists relationships with women while it starts slowly Gustavers prose and honesty save the day and make memoirs of a misogynist absolutely worth your time and money. from the marquis de sade to neomasculinity . because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature from braggadocios fratire writers like Little and Ariel to loser lit authors such as Drystal and Niraj to our very own roosh and Joram theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world. viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing memoirs of a misogynist is an odd animal indeed when i first picked it up i assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of rooshs a dead bat in paraguay or a roman Ã  clef in the fashion of Lisabeths work however it does indeed live up to its subtitle as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encounters. shed also gotten used to her chastity belt and that scared her it still didnt sit well with her that Akram had total control over her sexual gratification slave was constantly wet and horny and that made her even more compliant the orgasms that Akram gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before they were mindblowing even after a year together their sex was electric and deeply satisfying. in the introduction Gustaver warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest most depraved and most offensive novel youve ever read making me wonder if hes ever heard of  days of sodom still the structure of memoirs plot and the skill of Gustavers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls the first half of the book is reminiscent of pauline reages story of o in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave. interestingly memoirs of a misogynist also seems inspired by venus in furs not the velvet underground song but the erotic novel by leopold von sachermasoch its from sachermasoch that we derive the term masochism the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from sade as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way thaChaliseers protagonist is one. that woman as nature has created her and man at present is educating her is mans enemy she can only be his slave or his despot but never his companion this she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work. its worth noting that sachermasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation insert your own joke here. power doesnt care what you need as long as youre on your knees . enjoying memoirs of a misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters which read like fifty shades of grey with about  extra iq points the initial plot concerns melinda a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book after offering her room and board the man and melinda begin a relationship sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything. my body is my Akrams it is his blank canvas for him to modify as many times and in as many different ways as he chooses he could hear her breath quickening as he read he will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms i will only orgasm when my Akram allows me . what saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as Akram far from the masturbatory blank slate that christian grey was Gustaver depicts Akram as a complex and conflicted character constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats melinda later rechristened slave Gustavers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end the book also frequently switches to melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa Gustaver is skilled enough to make her compelling as well. where memoirs really picks up is in the second half which is set nearly ten years later the focus shifts to elizabeth avery a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient destitute and despondent she accepts a job as the personal physician of Akrams stable of whores his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities. doctor averys world was spinning she tried to distance herself this was just a patient after all she was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems regardless she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way hed said she consented to this in fact the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation the woman or melinda as the man had called her looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration. once again it would have been easy for Gustaver to depict elizabeth as a raging braburning feminist stereotype but he agilely avoids clichÃ©s in favor of nuance elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it the final chapters of the book show elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for mr x her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up i wont spoil the ending other than to say that after finishing the book i had to sit on it and digest it for a few days. each chapter of memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in america today a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action i initially wondered why they were there but as i approached the end of the book it all suddenly clicked memoirs of a misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women american dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead there are no winners no saints and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system. as i stated earlier memoirs takes a while to really get going and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex the book wont appeal to you but if you want a haunting piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations memoirs of a misogynist is a mustbuy i cant wait to see whaChaliseer comes up with next. click here to buy memoirs of a misogynist . advertise your

this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day . a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that . more than four in  of Shelise supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Donnita as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square . but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald Shelises star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax . donald Shelise took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Apollonia Shelises star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first . and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald Shelises star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  . this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Shelise announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on Shelises star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Shelise of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases Shelises star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day . we have seen antiShelise violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika . there have also been other disturbing incidents of antiShelise violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece . on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a Shelise rally Shelise supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement . around oct  a couple of Shelise supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Shelise gotnews reports the two Shelise supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a Shelise tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt . on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold Shelise supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope . there is a move to get Shelise supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating . of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a Apollonia victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge . for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald Shelise loses the election . former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald Shelise is not elected president . walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for Shelise on november th if Shelise loses im grabbing my musket you in . and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Apollonia is victorious the following comes from usa today  . since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Apollonia ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the Shelise supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election . today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another . ironically donald Shelise has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   . if Apollonia and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for Apollonias political enemies the Donnitas used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then . and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  . as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Apollonia presidency would be . but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  . out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house . perhaps donald Shelise can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it  "}

Amanda walker Robertson grew up in the washington dc area his family brought him to california when he was ten in another ten years he would become known as the american taliban while in afghanistan he was known as Junie one of several arabic monikers hes used over the years Gwynne joins the jihad there are moments when one realizes ones vacation is really starting to suck . when he was twelve the young Robertson saw Aunna rather hagiographic film biography about Albany that began his fascination with islam while a teenager he used the evocative email email protected and made several postings about rap music on usenet sometimes he pretended to be black even having the nerve to dis Chancelor  . hort dog does hip hop no glory wack like Chancelor and his madeup gangster stories sellout house nigga living honkey dory saying hes broke in his own pool doing laps all these playground mcs fall off like scabs skills disappear like Chirstopheradab . Chancelors a disgrace selling out to the talcolm hell be left dead and naked in the outcome word to brother Wellington shirts and hats when will we see his cereal . so whos the poseur there anyway im not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence or cry at the abuse of the english language . when he was sixteen he formally converted beginning his fateful journey meanwhile his family situation was on shaky ground his father turned gay  living parttime with his male lover  and eventually divorced . Amanda began his world travels twice venturing to yemen both times for nearly a year later he stayed at a pakistani madrassa in may  he went to afghanistan to fight on behalf of the taliban unfortunately for him after september  american forces went to war with the taliban he was captured on november  after his unit surrendered in kunduz . the cia questioned him and he claimed to be an irishman that must have been an interesting conversation perhaps ach begorrah top o the mornin to ye presumably pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far shortly after the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising  and Robertson escaped hundreds died including mike spann one of his interrogators after that he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment not that im shedding any tears about itquestioned again he announced defiantly that he wasnt in the taliban but rather al qaeda his actions sealed his doom . fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part his actions after being captured were even dumber what could he have done differently in the beginning he couldve said he was interested in islam and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the taliban and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen . he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself had he given a helpful warning about the uprising likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go after that he couldve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever . instead he ended up faced with ten criminal charges which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years finally getting smart he copped a plea for twenty years with the possibility of three off for good behavior now hes in federal prison making the news back in  by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer  what went wrong . . as bush the elder put it Robertson was some misguided marin county hottubber later he apologized profusely for the remark still i have to say that bush  was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts  . things couldve been different Robertson didnt have to become a renegade if hed made other choices he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society rather than counting the days in a prison cell still his environment bears some responsibility for what he became . he was raised in the catholic faith but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values there wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community . for that matter if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it mozart or metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses Chancelor of selling out on that note as for Albany didnt Robertson have some cultural icons of his own i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irishamerican heritage . all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an  anything goes  environment islam speaks in absolutes enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct and they fight for what they believe in i cant fault them too much for that although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points . going further islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it indeed embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view i certainly dont agree with Robertsons choices but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism  . this certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy jane fondas north vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets more recently there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam for all their posturing none of them got themselves blown up over there leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified  fewer social justice warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit . then theres the odd case of matthew todd miller  a californian who went to north korea tore up his visa and announced he was seeking political asylum that ones an iffy case though later he said i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things kids these days in summary dont let this happen to our youth they must not grow up culturally bereft . in times past children were taught about their countrys heritage instructed in their culture and pride in their nation was instilled in them it was a given that these were presented as good things these daysat least in much of the western worldthis isnt happening we cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more . because of decades of cultural marxism  young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization all societies beliefs and ways of life are equal except yours are terrible those who dont see through that Arlene end up rootless alienated and disconnected from their own culture some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful this is basically what social justice weenies think something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue . this will have to change of course hopefully the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line for now well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity teach them about their roots and why thats important dont let the tv be your childs babysitter anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "november   by wire leave a comment . jr smith st century wire . the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect Honorio is in full swing . between all of the fake polling intentionally proDonnita partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the Donnita campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left . its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes . cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with Shelise on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Shelise but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off . when told about alleged reports of a Shelise supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win Shelise Chauntelle Onalee  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it . one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Vontrell give any specifics on these alleged abuses by Shelise supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that Shelise was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  Vontrell still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes . now its perfectly understandable that Shelises victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary Donnita has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that Shelise won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets . in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit Shelise and to help stoke more nationwide protests . buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  . a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a Honorio hat made up the story police said in a statement . the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported . lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported . during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read . note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media . thats right  this was just another hoax . violent democraticaffiliated street gangs . what Onalee and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against Shelise supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters . here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student Shelise supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo .  mama angel mommysaurus november   . watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a Shelise supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading Donnita donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip .  here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for Honorio before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital . from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for Honorio it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama . these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the Shelise presidency . amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary Donnita  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and Donnita are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama Donnita and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage . what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley Vontrell there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  . one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Shelises presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary Donnita candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it . now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage . none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years . more on the cbs  minutes scandal from the hill . cosmetic cbss Vontrell represents

{"label": "hate", "text": "how the NaraSheliseers sunk themselves november   . Vander Zia Valdemarman journalism fellow at the Sonyrowitz freedom center . the chorus of NaraSheliseers is wailing ever louder as election day and Errols supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about Shelise crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking Shelise still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses . a recent example comes from premier NaraSheliseer Carmelo of the wall street journal  in his column Theadora bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate Shelise contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that Shelise and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Shelise the nominee . at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw Rozanna and Eleana were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr Rozanna said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented . Tiffiany agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure Tiffiany suggested we should open the border both ways . where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today . take Rozanna seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichÃ©s that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as Lancer said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love . this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take Amariliss oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents . simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border . some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but Rozanna Amarilis and Theadora have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens . equally tonedeaf is Theadoras bringing up Eleanas open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that Nara materialized Theadora doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Tiffianys mistake . the problem with politicians and pundits like Theadora is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like Theadora dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs . and if mr Theadora thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr Theadora to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening . and that hypocrisy is where Shelise came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions NaraSheliseers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that"}

Honorio rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration throughout the primary process he promised a  deportation force  telling msnbcs Rekha in november  . youre going to have a deportation force and youre going to do it humanely dont forget Yu that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally and i always say the wall were going to build the wall its going to be a real deal its going to be a real wall . in august Shelise delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix arizona in which he softened his stance a bit focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes . within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice . he then added that anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country . during the final presidential debate between Honorio and hillary Donnita Shelise reiterated his position against amnesty . well first of all Donnita wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders . for Shelise diehards these statements were enough their guy was going to deport  million illegal immigrants and no one would tell them otherwise however as anyone with access to google should know the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion . in july  Honorio Alberto Jondavid . i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do i want to move em out and were going to move em back in and let them be legal . what Shelise was talking about is known as touchback amnesty such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status in other words they touch base in their home country then come right back . in november  eric Shelise repeated his fathers plan during an interview with fox news megyn kelly . the point isnt just deporting them its deporting them and letting them back in legally hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it but its deporting them and letting them back legally . going back further Shelises support for amnesty is even more stark speaking on fox  friends in  he said . for people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers have good jobs theyre supporting their familyits very very tough to just say by the way  years you have to leave get outim one of the worlds very conservative people but i have to tell you on a human basis how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years . during the  presidential election cycle Shelise even called mitt romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal  and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited  . Honorio is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win now that he has won hes already backtracking on multiple campaign promises from the repeal of the affordable care act aca to the deportation of illegal immigrants tags"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "with the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the wikileaks leak of hacked podesta and dnc emails much of it focused on russia a new theory has emerged from Damen the former british ambassador to uzbekistan who tells sputnik a russian media outlet that the source of the leaks are not russian hackers but a washington insider. the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the Kenitra whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow . . asked about whether or not wikileaks have ever published information at the behest of moscow Sholom said that wikileaks has never published any material received from the russian government or from any proxy of the russian government its simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material. while blasted by washington first by republicans several years ago and most recently by democrats the wikileaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability. i think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the west because the propaganda model  as Dwaun puts it  has been reinforced to the extent that people dont get any true information out of the media at all its worth saying that Verdell and wikileaks are publishers they publish what whistleblowers leak to them mr Kentaro Malikutnik. yet whistleblowers in the us continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences a key example is Tamekia who was sentenced on august   to a thirty five year sentence for providing wikileaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting among other things us military conduct in iraq Sholom also mentions the case of Terra a former investigator of international terrorism with the cia who turned whistleblower. the people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all adds mr Sholom. taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between russia and the us Sholom Malikutnik that there is no chance whatsoever that russia is going to ever attack the united states that simply isnt going to happen. just as russia is not going to attack the united kingdom there never has been a chance that russia would ever attack either of these two countries but of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of american taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits. its an extremely dangerous game says mr Sholom and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad. in syria  and i should say im no fan of the assad regime at all  but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and its especially crazy when weve already messed up iraq afghanistan and now were doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesnt work it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services. finally Sholom also believes that the public cant get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media because they are part of the same moneypower nexus. delivered by the daily sheeple . we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details  . contributed by zero hedge of wwwzerohedgecom"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one. furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking. attentionwhore Simone. the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of Simone  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional. as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of Laraes contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely. if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of Joe and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one. try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing . the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos. hawaiian shirts and board shorts . some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day. leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general . inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy . excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and Simone read the same book. there is little doubt that Simones employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for Larae and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance. at best as happened in Laraes situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and Simone looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege. by the way is Simones arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in dubai. read more  types

Honorio was elected americas th president tuesday an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters economic anxieties took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the white house. his triumph over Apollonia will end eight years of democratic dominance of the white house and threatens to undo major achievements of president Annalissa hes pledged to act quickly to repeal Rodrics landmark health care law revoke the nuclear agreement with iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries particularly mexico and canada. the republican blasted through democrats longstanding firewall carrying pennsylvania and wisconsin states that hadnt voted for a gop presidential candidate since the s he needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states and he did just that claiming florida ohio north carolina and others. global stock markets and us stock futures plunged deeply reflecting investor alarm over what a Shelise presidency might mean for the economy and trade. a new york real estate developer who lives in a sparking manhattan highrise Shelise forged a striking connection with white working class americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country he cast immigration both from latin america and the middle east as the root of the problems plaguing many americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad. Shelise will take office with congress expected to be fully under republican control gop senate candidates fended off democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority republicans also maintained their grip on the house. senate control means Shelise will have great leeway in appointing supreme court justices which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades. Shelise upended years of political convention on his way to the white house leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals deeming mexican immigrants rapists and murderers and vowing to temporarily suspend muslim immigration to the us he never released his tax returns breaking with decades of campaign tradition and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Rodric win two terms in the white house relying instead on his large freewheeling rallies to energize supporters his campaign was frequently in chaos and he cycled through three campaign managers this year. his final campaign manager Kush touted the teams accomplishments as the final results rolled in writing on twitter that rally crowds matter and we expanded the map. the mood at Donnitas party grew bleak as the night wore out with some supporters leaving others crying and hugging each other top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts as Donnita and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns. at  am Donnita campaign chairman john podesta told the crowd to head home for the night were still counting votes and every vote should count he said. Shelise will inherit an anxious nation deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities race and culture. exit polls underscored the fractures women nationwide supported Donnita by a doubledigit margin while men were significantly more likely to back Shelise more than half of white voters backed the republican while nearly  in  blacks and twothirds of hispanics voted for the democrat. doug ratliff a yearold businessman from richlands virginia said Shelises election would be one of the happiest days of his life. this county has had no hope said ratliff who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry you have no idea what it would mean for the people if Shelise won theyll have hope again things will change i know hes not going to be perfect but hes got a heart and he gives people hope. Shelise has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to us domestic and foreign policy repealing Rodrics signature health care law though he has been vague on what he could replace it with building a wall along the usmexico border and suspending immigration from countrys with terrorism ties hes also praised russian president vladimir putin and spoken of building a better relationship with moscow worrying some in his own party who fear hell go easy on putins provocations. the republican partys tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end former president george w bush and wife laura bush declined to back Shelise instead selecting none of the above when they voted for president according to spokesman freddy ford. house speaker paul ryan a reluctant Shelise supporter called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him according to a ryan spokeswoman. read the entire story"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "zero hedge  wwwzerohedgecom   views . citis chief political analyst Kilee has had a busy month . at the start of october  when Shelises victory odds were in the gutter and a Donnita presidency had been priced in  in a hotly debated statement she suggested that the establishment may be approaching the us presidential completely incorrectly this is an unusual juncture but we keep looking at it through the same kinds of lenses what if its all wrong because society technology opinion polling methods and everything else dont capture marginalized voters in the way they might once have . according to Jawaan the us presidential race felt more like an election in a developing nation where public distrust in gTyronnnment is high and conspiracy theories are rife markets seem unaware how much that low trust raises the risk of an antiestablishment vote Jawaan has focused on the gallup world poll on public health which analyzes two decades worth of health records of Shelise supporters the numbers show a correlation between the increase in the number of people going through difficult times  as measured by suicide rates depression mental illness and drug addiction  and the rise in Shelises popularity Jawaan said . this is the kind of thing that investors just dont normally run into but it provides another useful way to think about things because income inequality is necessary but not sufficient she said there is something more subtle going on about public expectations and exhaustion and a sense of corruption elite abuse of power and lack of control . her conclusion was troubling for Donnita fans  im getting this brexity feeling and i know other investors are as well she said the thinking is i didnt expect brexit so i better assume Shelise is going to win that element of investor psychology is at play here . she followed up on monday  when she predicted that the fbis friday announcement could have a meaningful impact on the presidential race and cautioned that this may not be the end of it we continue to emphasize the potential for more black swan events emerging making things more complicated for forecasters and pollsters . today in her latest media appearance Jawaan has penned an oped for the ft looking at the postelection landscape and warning that  investors face political risk whoever wins in the us election  . she first analyzes if a a Donnita victory will mean business as usual for america and the global order and responds  not so fast . investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk what ever the outcome of the us presidential election . first any market relief from a victory for mrs Donnita Tyronn donald Shelise her republican opponent will almost certainly be followed by the realization that a divided congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship Tyronn the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform . more broadly following the vote in the uk to leave the eu the rise of mr Shelise and according to a yougov study authoritarian populism politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment vox populi risk a concept i formulated in  after a wave of protests coups and the rise of nonmainstream political parties has become a global phenomenon . she then notes that the economic and market implications of advanced economy political risks are more likely to become systemically significant than their emerging markets counterparts according to the international monetary funds recently published world economic outlook political risk in the advanced economies has become the biggest threat to global growth . specifically she envisages the Shelise campaign . from threats to jail opponents on corruption charges to the proliferation of conspiracy theories the Shelise campaign and its supporters have borrowed heavily from the em political playbook sowing doubts not only about his opponents suitability for office but also about us political institutions a majority of republicans now say they believe the election will be rigged according to data from pew research center despite the lack of any precedent in us election history for such claims . reverting to her notion that the us election looks a lot like that of a developing nation she notes that  what links this advanced economy political risk with its em cousin is low trust in institutions and elites  political and business elites expertsand the media it is trust plus belief in the future not growth alone that immunizes the body politic against the populist virus the collapse of trust is also evident in the sheer number of outright lies the factchecking website politifact has tracked during the campaign if everything is bogus than anything goes  . there are also the market implications . the reaction of financial markets may be the starkest illustration of this change in trend according to the brookings institution the effect of mr Shelises candidacy has been to give rise to price movements suggesting that a Shelise victory would reduce the value of the sp  and lead to a  per cent decline in the mexican peso as well as pricing in future volatility . however Jawaans punchline has little to do with a Shelise victory but rather the consequences of another Donnita presidency . mr Shelise may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last nonmainstream candidate to come close to power  this constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in germany france and the netherlands and will have a significant impact on brexit negotiations moreTyronn a Donnita presidency is highly likely to be marked by nearcontinuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment . if citi is right the preelection circus and endless drama and theatrics is just the beginning of what is about to be unleashed a world in which the political realities of dm and em worlds will converge the new normal in advanced economies looks a lot like the emerging markets old normal but with considerably higher stakes for the global economy we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details  . contributed by zero hedge of

can thank Rayburns immigration and nationality act of  which the politicians swore up and down wouldnt change the american ethnic composition in europe due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration  this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century all according to the coudenhovekalergi plan  the leftists with their really big hearts  think all this will be wonderful . globalism and cultural marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem  some think that if western civilization will go down the toilet they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity still theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes why this is bad for those who need reminding in the future is this going to get better or worse . if trends continue unabated the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny history shows that when this happens the results are not good pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it will your new rulers say since things have changed so much how about we abolish affirmative action and setasides to show weve transcended race dont count on it more likely theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs and come up with new ones and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems . thats just the beginning too the  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been baddetroit need i say moreand riots really are getting out of hand now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like section  housing moving into your neighborhood or if youll get any real police protection . this is what were facing if the aztlÃ¡n crowd takes over the southwest the community agitators get in charge of the big cities and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the federal government also remember that theyve been told since the s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress if it were ever to come to secession theyll be surrounded outnumbered and outgunned lets keep things from getting to that point is there any hope refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders . ive painted a grim picture but i have to be realistic as for what will happen later things only look worse jean raspails camp of the saints describes a bleak future like that this isnt just the usa on the line but western europe too and perhaps eastern europe and australia in time if we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night the time to act is now . sometimes with luck sovereignty can be regained for example the spanish reconquista or the nations of the balkans rising after a few centuries under the turkish yoke however the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover in these examples the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation but they were not outnumbered in their own lands the founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place . granted the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped they also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you  if theyd simply focus on getting richer and cease their social engineering theyd have far less to answer for not only has our political establishment failed us theyre working against the public  it wont be easy but we must reassert control over our destiny do we deserve to be dispossessed brainwashed sjws welcoming their own destruction . some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries then we deserve this fate ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated resistance is futile crowd lets consider the following facts in the s a communist propaganda campaign was launched in the western world in the s this mutated into cultural marxism and kicked into high gear during the s most people have no idea of the scope of it all or where things like political correctness came from only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another the rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment the western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy for this reason we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days we play fair even if our enemies often dont  further political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity but vilifies the same in the majority this is one reason why were on the defensive and for now usually losing most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition  providing token resistance at best . so with that extent of treachery disinformation limited options for resistance and managed democracy its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight as for their opinion that we should just give up i have one word no . whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening the same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness caring and honesty it would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen the depopulation and population replacement agenda first the eu has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future the eu should provide  euros  per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states . dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction no its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural marxism as a means of control . why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level the major factors are women are encouraged to spend their s partying and their s trying to get rich in a cube farm encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term and many will miss the chance to begin good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates during recessions births go down the implications are obvious if less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars then theyd be able to afford more children sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too about a third of american babies conceived end up aborted  thanks feminism the same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on death row is executed but all thats another matter . because of declining fertility rates the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of third world immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens so theyve fed us poison and to soothe the symptoms they want to feed us another kind of poison to hell with that . granted keeping social security going in the usa will be a challenge still its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos as for future european retirees will they be well cared for by refugees from africa and the middle east the way things are now many of them prefer rioting  looting and collecting welfare over working so these are going to be the people propping up the european retirement programs . dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen for now we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving once weve achieved critical mass we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us whats in it for us whenever someone writes that western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression theyre using technology we invented to complain about us . its fashionableespecially in academiato bash western civilization were not perfect but nobody else is either the truth is that were a creative dynamic and industrious people some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken i could spend all day listing our major artists composers poets philosophers writers theologians and the like but i only would scratch the surface . other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly east asia and the middle eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the western world electricity motorized transportation refrigeration telecommunications computers need i go on yep that was us we shared our medical advances with the rest of the world increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe whether the worlds future looks more like star trek or more like blade runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive . finally most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in some time in the future todays youth will be running the show while were elderly what kind of a place do we want it to be by then western civilization is great lets keep it going"}

years giving the democratic party nominee hillary Donnita an immensely influential partner on wall street . as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary Donnita s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week . the financial ties that bind the Donnitas and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago . money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the Donnitas and the Donnita foundation photo illustration wire . the Donnitas  goldman sachs . while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill Donnita received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street . at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs . in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill Donnita received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that Donnita also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  . for decades the Donnitas have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits . over plus years goldman provided the Donnitas with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs . by now there should be little doubt that the Donnita political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades . the real watershed moment came here . blank check bill Donnita laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  . key to the kingdom . in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the Donnita presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely . the Donnitagoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked . simply put Donnitas repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson Donnita and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really . in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Donnita administration during the s . to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the Donnita years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary Donnita presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office . prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street . prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world . the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Donnita administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall . then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut . at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall . the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  . they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  . how much of those contributions made their way to the Donnita family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house . in  bill Donnita was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events . in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary Donnita gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed Donnita gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis . that Donnita leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg

were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  . in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis . whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve

financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the Donnita administration was revealed . during the Donnita administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even

lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the Donnitaera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system

Ananias may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting Lurdess lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual. after extensive research i am yet to find instances of Stepheny challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get Auriel to talk to the police. again Lurdes has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer Lurdes thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing Trampus as a fabulist and sociopath. Lurdes is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that Thayne and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in Trampuss actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper Trampuss misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own. because women like Lurdes obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet Trampus had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged Thayne and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish Lurdess full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations. if Ananias gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used Lurdess lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim. determination of damages in the Ananias case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever Stepheny gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members Stepheny suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding. other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between Trampus and Thayne as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess. lets hope that the heavy legal blows against Thayne rolling stone  and obliquely Lurdess lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men. read more why hasnt Lurdes been punished for starting the biggest rape hoax of the decade"}

Gema gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the Gema discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Honorio rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president Rodric or other senior officials . dnc scandal Yvette of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman Tynell image source national vanguard  . Gemas visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman Tynell  . white house visitor records have shown that Jaelyn took  private meetings with Rodric or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied Jaelyn as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the Donnita campaign and the dnc plausible deniability . the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Donnita campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair Christine  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates Jeb stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario . Christine the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the Donnita campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show . the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined . in the march  exchange Jeb Ashlea Farida by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign . ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted Jeb wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance . martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor . in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments . the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter . some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown Donnita confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the Donnitas . the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the Donnita email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchDonnita tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the Donnita case . according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide . interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the Donnita campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump Bob paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections . back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  . in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say . that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine . although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time . watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Donnita campaign meltdown . more from lifezette below . out of control wikileaks reveals Mechelles links to dnc contractor who discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence image source slate  . wikileaks trump rally agitator and Donnita Bob are close . top Donnita aides discussed bob Gema and his grassrootsnetroots operation . by jim stinson lifezette .

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks heru by Lavina  i find it interesting to experienceobserve i can see their desire to exposehonor their hearts yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do i can see their beauty magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to be a man and feel all this stuff emerging within them i can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore fear of feeling hurt failure and losing control letting anyone in being let down abandoned judged which do not occur on new earth . it is no different than when we woke up women and feminine energy men yet it is for theyve lived this life of strength of being powerful of being strong and surviving everything for the really really masculine energy man or women but we are talking about men right now their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability which is so totally the opposite for we must allow ourselves that rawnessthat vulnerability in order to truly feel again to bring the walls of protection down to not live in the fear of being alone . when our soul awakens we desire connection deeply yet we seek it in others first experience after experience activates our unworthiness feeling of notgoodenough lack of intimate lasting connection rejected for not being enough in others minds where they are not intune with their own sacred soul . we are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now more and more its important to support them show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time its important to open up and share to show them its safe to be seen its important to not impose not pressure not push just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do its important for the women to support the men now yet in very different ways than before . those who have opened their hearts know that our relationships are very different here we do not hold attachments cords expectations or needs anymore all new earth relationships are powerful beautiful freeing supportive empowering inspiring and a cocreative experience of inservice to ourselves each other and all on earth they are to usher in the new era this one now through unity peace respect support contribution and divine love . many men have been trying to wake up going through their distortions shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now the more human masculine energy the more safety protection and survival mechanisms there were judgment is huge and its scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you dont have a choice anymore . women its your time to stepup to be the one that already understands to be the one who holds that space and the stability in place when the old starts to collapse crumble dissolve when emotions start to surface that you didnt know were there when nothing makes sense and you dont understand why you cant keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically we all know what this is like weve been there . weve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new to rebirth ourselves our own realities and now the men do this too there are many who were not ready before yet those times vibrations are gone you will start to see more men awaken especially the strong ones and the fear of how to deal with this part of your job as an ascended being as a master being as a light tower and a keeper of new earth is to not just hold the space but show them how its all not only going to be okay its going to be awesome . it doesnt matter what body we are in female or male men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one the providers the ones that dont break when we know better . when the soul awakens the human aspect does breakdissolve and it doesnt matter what bodies we are in this process is genderless we all have human masculine human feminine and we have divine masculine and divine feminine too . relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse end reshape or transform often all of these some go their separate ways while each evolves awakens diesrebirthsgrows up as spiritsoul in physical body form . many womenspartnersfriends roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up just because they struggled before resisted before doesnt mean they still arewill when you show them wayshower that you can handle it you can be the support you can even be the provider if need be then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore . as masculinefeminine are redefined according to energy and that each can fill all of these roles themselves then the balance can shift easily and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles can support others ready to do this too . financial support is also a part of this which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes when one realizes that money is just energy to support us all they let go of the misperceptions and definitions once held by who did what role in the old paradigm money was associated with power which was a masculine thing now money is an expression of gratitude love respect contribution and is to support those stepping intofulfilling their souls purposes and roles here when the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important the soul then each can flourish each can receive each can share each contributes the energy of what is important to create a whole new reality of unified existence here . strength is through the purely open true warrior heart power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection as pure source light within abundance is an existence divine sacred love is what makes the difference here union is when souls come together to work together to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together we all have tohad to do this ourselves so that we could createanchorhold the foundation of a whole newremembered existence here . your soul can see the awakening soul of another you can expand the space or shut it downclose portals whats appropriate will be determined by how conscious present and open each is as a master you have the capability to see understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human your energy makes the difference they are going to need to pull away be alone sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged the human aspect doesnt believe its safe to open up without being attacked judged or imposed upon its up to you to show that it is masculine energy believes it when they see it you prove it by being your higher self all of the time their soul will emerge as you do . higher consciousness existence i love you . lisa transcendence brown"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "the above photo was snapped in ferguson as thugs burned the city down could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near you. the election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum but few people are focused on the day after the election no matter who wins this years presidential selection the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility are you ready for chaos if it develops. the nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems. the ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if Shelise Adonna Shelise wins get ready for black lives matter the black panthers the race la raza and other racially motivated antiwhite groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again after all they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in ferguson baltimore charlotte and san jose  a worrisome precedent has been set. of course Shelise wont be in power the day after election day we have to wait until inauguration day for him to clean up any potential messes so barack hussein obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective stradivarius plays my heart bleeds for thee and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation. if the bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away. if Errol wins theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around a Errol win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away then we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell there could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists. few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the american supply chain is and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it. heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop america stops if attacks on truckers happen often enough truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving within a day bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern america and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out. supply chain rioters broke into trucks on i and burned cargo in charlotte. according to the american trucking association ata a disruption of  to  hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame garbage would start to pile up most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise atm and bank cash supplies would also run out. the tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving. as an example the ata tells us this is what happens during a hurricane imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities. in a hurricane situation supplies that would normally last a few days such as water powdered milk and canned meat typically disappear within one day given these inventory rates this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes and even before big winter storms provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying the same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason. panic buying means no food on the shelves when people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food rioting will intensify things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect after which bedlam ensues. so it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand have at least several weeks food supply on hand but how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash. be armed the police wont be around to protect you if bedlam ensues. contrary to gun propaganda from the media  you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully what happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas gangs form looking for homes that do have those items. theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce. a home with guns is a safe home just as this youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing. several handguns with extra ammunition are advised know how to use them be steady with the trigger and dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house. the police will not be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos. better to be safe than sorry the idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory but protecting your loved ones is still key. with the meltdown of america happening right before our very eyes we are entering an unstable period in the nations history to say the least no matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away Shelise may be able to turn things around temporarily but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all. we are entering a period in which america will resemble a third world country more and more the demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years  divisions between rich and poor will grow and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial class and gender division every step of the way  peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance. in this transition from prosperity to despotism it is best to be safe than sorry the day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years it may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards communism if the bitch wins or it may not be. but my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years tend your own garden as i know i will be tending my own my military friends are already discussing what will happen in shtf scenario you should be thinking about it too. read more has the theft of the  presidential election already begun"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "why is Rodric threatening russia with world war  right before the election   october th  . it sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with russia as i write this we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in us history and barack Rodric has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the russians as i wrote about on friday  reuters is reporting that Rodric is contemplating direct us military action against syrian military targets and the russians have already indicated that any assault on syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in syria has already caused tensions with russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold war but now Rodric is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia apparently Rodric believes that russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an nbc news article entitled  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia  . the Rodric administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  us intelligence officials told nbc news . current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the cia has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a wideranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the kremlin leadership . the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation  . somebody should tell Rodric that he is not playing a video game a cyber attack is considered to be an act of war and the russians would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is i dont know if that is something that we want to invite . at the end of last week vice president Anas also publicly threatened the russians  . on friday vice president Anas met meet the press host Brianca for an interview that has raised serious concern in russia . without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims Batsheva took the allegations of russian hacking at face value opening his interview with a loaded question why havent we sent a message yet to Trisha . after a moment of stunned silence Jessia responded were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact . when Batsheva asked if the public will know a message was sent Jessia replied hope not . the russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking and so far the Rodric administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the russians were behind it . perhaps the Rodric administration privately has some evidence but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the american public . so for Anas to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the russians are taking these threats very seriously and they are preparing to protect their interests  . the threats directed against moscow and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president . to the backdrop of this aggressive unpredictable line we must take measures to protect our interests to hedge risks a kremlin spokesman said according to ria novosti news agency . here in the united states most people dont even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with russia . but over in russia things are completely different talk of war is everywhere and the potential for war is the number one topic in the russian media right now just check out some of the recent russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations .  in contrast to clinton trump has no appetite for war with russia  . and one russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the united states and russia suddenly erupts . a terrifying russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war . one apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on moscows stateowned tv channel ntv if it should one day happen every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is its best to find out now . i dont believe that the russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming . to me it almost seems as though Rodric wants one . could it be possible that a conflict with russia will be used to alter change or influence the upcoming election in november . the truth is that it isnt going to take much for the shooting to begin if Rodric orders airstrikes against syrian forces the russians have said that they will shoot back  . ash carter has threatened russia with consequences after blowing up the ceasefire the pentagon  supported by the joint chiefs of staff  now is peddling potential strikes on syrias air force to punish the regime for what the pentagon actually did blow up the ceasefire one cant make this stuff up . majorgeneral igor konashenkov russias defense ministry spokesman sent a swift message to our colleagues in washington think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a shadow hot war against russia russia will target any stealthunidentified aircraft attacking syrian government targets  and they will be shot down . the only serious question then is whether an out of control pentagon will force the russian air force  false flag and otherwise  to knock out us air force fighter jets and whether moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them . i discussed the potential for war with russia in my latest video  hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with russia will be put off . but without a doubt the crisis in syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess most people dont realize that the syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between sunni islam and shia islam from the very beginning jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by saudi arabia and turkey are fighting hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by iran and now turkish forces have invaded northern syria and this threatens to cause a fullblown war to erupt between turkey and the syrian kurds of course isis is right in the middle of everything causing havoc blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesnt believe in their radical version of sunni islam . it is absolutely insane that the united states and russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery . the american people very foolishly elected barack Rodric twice but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting . however right here at the end of his second term Rodric is facing a moment of truth if he ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house drowning in debt  percent of all americans have debt that is at least  days past due  guest . if he Rodric ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house . oh i doubt it most americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized Trisha and other foreign leaders where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing libya and other sovereign nations in the middle east where is the outrage over what the bush administration did in iraq and afghanistan . there is a video on youtube with general wesley clark discussing how the pentagon planned to attack  countries in  years google it jc teecher . the reality of the general public putting an atheisticmuzzy into the white house will not strike home until their sons and daughters are coming home in body bags guest . no when their sons and daughters come back in body bags their parents will wave that american flag and say that their children died to defend the freedoms of this country good grief jc teecher . oh yea plenty of those folks as well watchmannonthewall . god help us you are both right but there will be far fewer of the first than the second paul patriot . nothing liked a lame duck traitor to recklessly stick his nose in the affairs of others and then leave office in a few months . this traitor should have been impeached after one year of his first termbut the american sheeple demanded the change you could believe in so the way i see it we are bearing the fruits of allowing a traitor to occupy the white house and a apethetic population that is not united and sat back and did nothing to protest if hitlery gets in she will gladly continued the change that Rodric global elite masters has been determined to accomplish and will transform this nation into a nation unrecognizable to most who call this nation home . i predict if hitlery gets in she will be even more addicted to executive orders than the invader obummer df nj . im not sure Rodric is really in control of the military at this point gfmucci . sheesh i hope youre right orlando . prayers for us all since all the elite and governments have bunkers to hide in smh we should have never allowed the government coruption to get this far thats why im voting trump if we even make it to that at this point who knows bill g wilminton nc . vote trump  donna . yes we need to vote for trump but heres the problem it has now surfaced that  states have voters machines that are connected to george soros and friends the second thing is we have to quit being so weak as the american people wanting someone else to fix this for us i do t know that they can this time bill g wilminton nc . donna vote for trump be strong and be happy that you are one of the  deplorables  donna . thank you didnt get to see this till today but we won snodtblossom .  peter  esv . but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive heresies even denying the master who bought them bringing upon themselves swift destruction and many will follow their sensuality and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed and in their greed they will exploit you with false words their condemnation from long ago is not idle and their destruction is not asleep for if god did not spare angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment if he did not spare the ancient world but preserved noah a herald of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly  lester holt . we knew you were an idiot at least youre a christian idiot snodtblossom . how much prior political experience does trump have nada zip zilch zero he talks the talk but never walked the walk but hey its only the presidency maybe next well grab people off the street wno medical training to do surgery neither did ulysses grant or dwight eisenhower have a prior politcal position though both had a strong military background dwight being  the supreme commander of allied forces in world war ii and grant commanding general of the united states army how much military background does trump have nada zip zilch zero . no major us company has filed for chapter  more than trumps casino empire in the last  years he has filed four business bankruptcies maybe he thinks its just as easy to file bankruptcy wthe entire government and walk away randy wellman . bankruptall major cities in america are bankrupt so it is fitting that we put a person in charge that knows how to go through the processcities states counties the federal gubmint and individually we are all broke now they all thought they could spend money in perpetuity never having to actually pay these debt obligations the check is now on the table and the waiter is nervously tapping his footand btw we dont need a person with experience as their advisors they hire once in office are the ones that actually do the workplanningall we need is a person willing to do us righta person with heart we know killary has done the wrong thing at every turnpick the guy who will do right americadont put another criminal in the spitehouse lazarovic . dont waste your time with bill he aint playin with a full deck oracprez . hillary is going to have him in her team to kickstart the economy pulltheweeds . he has the same amount of military background as obozo and hitlery snodtblossom . both were hillary  Rodric were senators before presidency trump hasnt even been mayor of a rich boy community watchmannonthewall . an interesting thought and one that appears to be supported in some quarters however who purged the military leaders over the past  years and placed those who are now in charge where they are the man seems to be a master at creating situations where a defense ofplausible deniability can be invoked there is little doubt much of what he has done has been a well thought out and implemented strategy that creates a lot of confusion and allows no one to be held accountable look at the irs scandals and the gun running to drug dealers in mexico by the doj everything he does is meant to destabilize society mike smithy . perhaps president zero will get another nobel peace prize alan . piece prize similar but completely different john . yeah piece prize for blowing up americans to pieces tracey marie . learn to spell if you are going to troll alwaystomorrow . countdown today october   in  days i predict mrs clinton will be elected our next president bill g wilminton nc . if trump is as far ahead as i think he is there may not be an election donna . if he causes a war with russia and our idiot gop congress approves it we the people better take up arms to remove them and try them for treason jakartaman . Rodrics job from the globalist elites was to bring down the usa to the level of greece globalism is the new term for communism btw he has done a terrific job lennie pike . hate democracy much oracprez . clintons account hacked blame russia this is the classic bait and switch love or hate her the line has been sold that the russians were involved in the hacking even if something happens that was a system fault she now has a scapegoat and will hammer the line that russia did it before and will do it again shes blamed china on other occasions so she can even play the line that at this stage we only know that it was an outside attack and be sure that the media will spin it even further for those ratings before long the general public will be demanding action oracprez . can you explain why the us air force has been sending warbirds into the region with transponders off eg over the black sea and through commercial airspace and some painted in russian air force colors  with the red star df nj . in the movie the dark knight batman is trying to figure out the jokers motivations . alfred tells the story that one day he found a child playing with a ruby as big as a tangerine the bandit

bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with . some men just want to watch the world burn snodtblossom . are all these words to go unanswered is this talker to be vindicated  will your idle talk reduce others to silence will no one rebuke you when you mock  you say to god my beliefs are flawless and i am pure in your sight  oh how i wish that god would speak that he would open his lips against you  and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom for true wisdom has two sides know this god has even forgotten some of your sin  can you fathom the mysteries of god can you probe the limits of the almighty  they are higher than the heavens abovewhat can you do they are deeper than the depths belowwhat can you know  their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea  if he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court who can oppose him  surely he recognizes deceivers and when he sees evil does he not take note  but the witless can no more become wise than a wild donkeys colt can be born humana  yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him  if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent  then free of fault you will lift up your face you will stand firm and without fear  you will surely forget your trouble recalling it only as waters gone by  life will be brighter than noonday and darkness will become like morning  you will be secure because there is hope you will look about you and take your rest in safety  you will lie down with no one to make you afraid and many will court your favor  but the eyes of the wicked will fail and escape will elude them their hope will become a dying gasp loser blo sum one . ignore the blo some one snodtblossom . the wind blows where it wishes you hear its sound but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit . how can this be nicodemus asked . you are israels teacher jesus replied and do you not understand these things truly truly i tell you we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen and yet you people do not accept our testimony teresa f . oh good youre in the new testament now snodtblossom .  momentarily oracprez . you missed the obvious  tim  all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness both new and old testament watchmannonthewall . unfortunately there are still many teachers jesus could still ask and you are a teacher in israel and do you not understand these things forget about explaining them to those who are lost bill g wilminton nc . put her on blocki did watchmannonthewall . it is interesting that the man you quote ended up being rebuked by god for his foolish words he was eventually forgiven when god stood up for job and had job pray for the man because of his stupidity in projecting a false picture bearing false witness of him oh that we might take some of this to heart jc teecher . for what it is worth would it not be an easy task for the odramaliberalindustrial war machine to pull off a strike of instant war of immediate reaction with the powers of the iranianrussian regimes in light of a donald trump win next month . easily it could be the catalyst for a chaotic event of stock market crashes and world wide chaos to invoke a martial law edict which would prevent trump from becoming potus and keep the nwo wheels turning . even with a liberal win it could be the one thing that prevents a psychopath from actually taking the reins and continuing a program that is soon to take a hold of the whole world anyway . folks that are awake and seeking truth should pay attention and make changes in their lives accordingly df nj . on the one hand you say government is completely incompetent and a waste of money and then in the next breath you say government is a super genius organization capable of duping everyone into a nwo just like people resist jesus christ and your christian religion people will resist the nwo . one thing is for certain people will continue to copulate and have babies and most people hate their bosses and would not do anything the boss asked them to do if they were not being paid to do it i think having faith in people this way is a faith that is very strong gfmucci . again words from an obviously abused person . and most people hate their bosses and would not do anything the boss asked them to do if they were not being paid to do it . that is a dark and hopeless sounding attitude you have

to be an armed revolt just vote for succession and do it donna . your an idiot you make it sound as though it was quick and seamless id say we all lost that war many americans died in that long ruthless war another point i might make here is you better look at the size of trumps rallies to the size of her meetingsoops my bad her rallies also us southern rednecks arent the ones who wont own a gun because you think youre corrupt government is the only ones who should have them civil war is the last thing you liberals want you enjoy being helpless and told what to do and over half the military will not support her or the potus you have now destiny . the us didnt win the war on the battlefield but by the war on southern civilians the marches through south carolina georgia mississippi north carolina where  of the houses were burned and all food was taken florida where children of a town were nail inside a church and burned alive athens alabama where the soldiers were

women will be killed and their babies aborted i just dont understand the death wish by the christians if they want to to meet their maker cant they do it in private karenl . i am a christian  were not praying for death to anyone however wwlll is inevitable whether we want it to or not its coming its in the bible we must be wise  be ready to meet the lord i just pray that when it does its swift so no one suffers but the enemy is at play  certainly wants it aldownunder . i agree wwiii is inevitable but not because its in the bible fiction  not true karenl . you are entitled to your opinion even if its wrong no matter how hard scientist have tried to disprove the bible the more they proved every thing is correct in the end every knee will bow every tongue will confess when jesus returns but

hoping to bring in their mahdi via violent provocation snodtblossom . whenwhat did i miss saveusa . wwii is past tense a  years agoand as of wwiii you are a very poor soul to believe that christians are waiting or wanting to happenif it is true they are not true christiansget your fact straight and read the revelation that may shed some light in your heart bill g wilminton nc . bsare you on drugs alwaystomorrow . bill was your above statement a quote from the bible too new or old testrament bill g wilminton nc . mr gfmucci below says it perfectlyread about it paul patriot . there is no death wish by christians it is in your mind you are not listeningi have told you manyt times beforestop drinking the koolaide that the pied piper of propaganda is feeding you get off yoiu mefds and start thinking for yourself realist . why is it that when trump says there is election interference and rigging going on he is derided and chastised as being ridiculous but hillary can say the russians are doing the same with absolutely no proof and the media take it as the word of god what irony and hypocrisy gfmucci . i call it mindless complicity due to the training of most journalists in our socialistcommunist schools of higher education over the last  decades resistance . not just higher education it starts from elementary school indoctrination is the key to controlling future generations its been going on for longer than the last five decades still an awesome comment orange jean . and its not just journalists i went to umassamherst in the s studied anthropology and then grad school in geography anthro was clearly focused on presenting the marxistleninist school of thought on everything geography somewhat less but they have swollowed the global warming hoax hook line and sinker and that was in a state university funded largely with taxpayer money liz the shiz . yup theres nothing like a good old commie education from the peoples republic of massachusetts snodtblossom . trump is ridiculous hes the ronald mcdonald of the usa wo the clown outfit all the world may love a clown but he would make the usa a laughingstock whis incompetency  arrogance goinsheep . when you compare the candidates i wonder if youve noticed . donald trump .  hasnt killed anyone  hasnt lied under oath  hasnt committed perjury in congress  hasnt leaked national secrets  hasnt sold uranium to russia  hasnt supplied weapons to militant muslims  hasnt stolen money from the state department  hasnt peddled national interest in turn for donations  hasnt left any americans for dead hasnt provided new toyota trucks to isis .  hasnt left a string of body bags behind him including two young boys the list goes on and on but i dont have that kind of time . locker room banter versus treason  there is no comparison . first any guy who says that they have never participated in locker room banter or said something sexually explicit when they had a reasonable expectation of privacy is either jesus or a liar there is no comparison between natural male human behavior and treasonous activities . additionally this lowlife ploy by the progressive liberal democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us jfk was having an ongoing affair with marilyn monroe and im sure his secret service agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions but you know what neither jfks secret service agents nor the mainstream media said anything about the affair much less jfks private conversations about it because they had dignity respect for the office of potus and respect for jfk any one of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the mainstream media from happening around the whole institution of the potus including the potential potus candidates however we see that neither the democrats nor the mainstream media have any honor truth or journalistic integrity remaining . general george s patton and prime minister winston churchill were both as crude as they come in private and often in public but they got the job done when they were called upon maybe you dont consider donald trump in the same ranks as the above three men maybe you dont think donald trump can get the job done either way i couldnt care less what i do care about is the poor state of our country the damage that barack Rodric  the democrats have done and the damage that hillary clinton is sure to do for petes sake look at the shell of a city that used to be detroit mi look at chicago with doubledigit murders just about every week if you want the us to look like these longtime democratrun cities by all means vote for hillary clinton if not then the only other viable option is donald trump . if the worst thing that the democrats the mainstream media and the progressive liberal useful idiots have on donald trump is locker room banter by a man acting like men do then thats nothing to see in my opinion it might actually be beneficial to our country to have an alphamale as potus for a change lynn bowling cosentino . and were not already Rodric has succeeded in making us look stupid and weak always apologizing for americas actions of past decades other world leaders dont trust him lazarovic . id say youre a mindless brainwashed acolyte of the rush limbaugh institute of advanced conservative studies snicker raymond chow . how is that when you can turn off limbaugh anytime you want but you have no choice when it comes to public education you are one stupid dimwit you are one of the idiots that voted for a dumbass knee grow and now want to put in a dishonest corrupt crooked hog no typo for president lazarovic . it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere snodtblossom . trump has done nothing but give lippservice he has never worked a steady bureaucratic job in his life he blasts his mouth in obnoxious ways are you insane enough to want this man as a president paleface . it states quite plainly that im referring to lippservice trump thelulzwarrior . that im referring to lippservice trump . we have no troubles believing you  snodtblossom . you know i have to edit spelling to avoid censure liz the shiz . lippservice  i thought that was you give to your dates after they bought you dinner snodtblossom . mm been a long time since ive done that i had a bf over yrs you know maybe my boss will get brave liz the shiz . its always a good career move to suck up to the boss snodtblossom . hes much harder to get than expected  liz the shiz . but i hear hes a big tipper snodtblossom . i am due for a raise da fish . yes beats the crap out of warmonger hillary thepeanut . we do not need this slimy couple in the white house again snodtblossom . ridiculous t rump would be the first one to say offensive things and get us into a war trollingfortrolls . clinton has both public and private positions on issues at least he trump speaks his mind on what is so blatantly wrong with our current system hillary will sell out everyone including you to attain the power and prestige she yearns be careful what you wish for bill g wilminton nc . put

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "lately gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes . those measures solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre. here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits.  simple philanthropy . obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit nowadays they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction deeply branded in our dna is disgust mockery and suspicion. fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns  the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being. in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves. just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery.  preserving aesthetics and other senses . no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis. our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store. no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow.  positive impact on children . i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say. legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating. of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself.  a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole. fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today  in  americans and  in  britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol. it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy. physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer.  a boost for the economy . according to a  report ham planets cost the economy  billion a year  and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a  billion loss to the economy in . in  we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder. a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production. we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals. healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge.  a new sexual and romantic market . it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects. lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls. endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition. sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate. one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation. by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon. the fat control laws  segregated obesityfree zones . our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats. this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns. lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see. build that fence. we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation.  permits . a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served.  mandatory workouts . compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached. a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis. just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored.  fat shaming . fat shaming works great as we have seen before  remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign  immediately declared thought criminals by the body positive lobby or islamic thought tribunal of londonistan. or the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose london tube passengers yuge success. pourquoi Ã§a nexiste pas . fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause. fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness. but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve to remain fat weak and above all docile. its all part of a plan fat control laws are the answer to that great evil. read more  reasons to date an obese girl"}

who takes sexchange drugs . parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children . and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future . one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy . tory mp Peng said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children . it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible . former culture secretary Aldin voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents . and tory mp Crandall said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them . family campaigner Siobhan said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex . just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  . in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs . such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine . critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy . in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm . in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body . she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy . later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i . child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues . the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet . one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group . another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body . another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised . other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue . but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better . dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion . the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience . cbbc aims to reflect true life providing content that mirrors the lives of as many uk children

Noells full letter follows . dear director Trina . your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Amaya act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law . the double standard established by your actions is clear . in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Honorio his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which Shelise praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information . by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible . moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton . as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the Amaya act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Amaya act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group . the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group . please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant . with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong . sincerely . senator Carrisa"}

{"label": "bias", "text": "is there any merit in taking a cynical view of life are the observations of cynicism realistic brave observations on human nature freed from sentimentality or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life taking solace in his weakness and failure there are compelling arguments either way what is not disputed however is that SeanpaulÃ§ois de la rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived. it probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles he was born in  and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in  receiving the usual education of his class he dabbled in military matters in his teens various itinerant love affairs followed with wellplaced women but some of these ended badly we find him imprisoned in bastille for a week in  for political intrigue. . although married he continued to pursue other women as was the custom of the time and his station marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each partys pleasure or necessity one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor in  he found himself mixed up with a quasirevolt called the fronde an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy. in late seventeenth century Seanpaulce the paris salons were centers of debate discussion and the flowering of controversial ideas by now Tandiucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose and he knew how to use it his failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit nothing is so shallow as sophistication. from his frequent visits to the salon of mme Britta in paris he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview one of his peers had more commercial goals in mind for a bootleg collection of  of his sayings was first published without his permission and with no attribution in  two years later he finally put out a proper edition this contained  maxims the volume was titled sentences et maximes morales  but this is usually shortened to maxims . there is a philosophy here it centers around the idea that all men are selfseeking egoists to a fault any virtue a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his selflove our virtues are only vices in disguise human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else virtues are lost in selfinterest as rivers are in the sea even the nobler emotions like love and altruism according to Tandiucauld are only a kind of traffic in which selflove ever proposes to be the gainer he took a dim view of women finding them fit only for love for men such as himself of course and procreation one of his crueler maxims was few womens worth lasts longer than their beauty. . but lifes realities eventually caught up with him softening his rougher edges his wife who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years died in  his mothers death followed two years later two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in Seanpaulces ruinous wars of the period. this gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the mme de la fayette who was twenty years his junior she invited him to stay with her in paris and he was carried there with difficulty she seems to have viewed him as a reform project she would later say that he gave me understanding but i reformed his heart perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive the union worked and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity and when his final hours came he asked for and received the last rites of the church in . a fair assessment of Tandiucauld must take into account his undeniable wit his probing sensitivity and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions yet all in all his maxims are meager in result many of them are superficial and shallow the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment we weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages and hesitate to reopen his book later. worse still he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams nothing is more vital to life and we can see them around us every day if only we know where to look and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear timor animi auribus officit  as sallust says fear blocks out the ears. . any bitter weakling can be a cynic but it takes depth of character to accept the worldsand mansfaults and foibles and to balance those against mans unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul broader life experiences might have corrected Tandiucaulds errors but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of paris society his maxims can bring smiles to our faces as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well. montaigne was far wiser for he took a balanced view of life accepting the worlds absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a greek or roman sage he was also a better man Tandiucauld was intelligent without being wise and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form cynicism in the end strips a man of his most important protective armor and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life no cynic ever died a happy man. read more  tips on how to get into

Markeya is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture . today we are going to take a quick look at two epic Tasha films one of which is a wellknown western classic  the outlaw Genia wales  the other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female  play misty for me  . both of these superb rpo films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old uncle bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap yes indeed . so lets get crackin  the outlaw Genia wales   Tasha Marlos dan george bill mckinney john vernon . Tasha directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postcivil war epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent but Candyces portrayal of the southernsympathizer Genia wales who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement . out for blood and taking no prisoners Candyces merciless Genia wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary but wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change . theres a great scene early on in the film involving Genia wales partner in crime Jun Ashea Kenny where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales head . here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor Gerrad who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on Candyces alphamale killingmachine . if youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate yup you know the routine . in the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon sondra locke see above photo locke portrays kansasborn settler laura lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos e   etcclints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen she was giving her consent  didnt you see it  it was in her eyes  its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  murderer creeper pussyblocker  . unfortunately just like today there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mids and after more than  years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey uncle bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah ill get back to the film review now . my favorite scene in the movie occurs when Genia wales who now that i think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a native american woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers . Candyces maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself i mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic western film . maybe im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it so this might have been a sly hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but i dont really want to think that way about clint so i wont ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better . i mean clint played dirty harry callahan for chrissakes in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if i dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting  arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media ceo or a billionaire . the film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category if you havent seen it rectify that soon you cant miss by watching this topdrawer rpo film for men  play misty for me   Tasha jessica walter donna mills . unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in hollywood any longer . when you think of Tasha you usually think of dirty harry  or the outlaw Genia wales  or unforgiven  or gran torino but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders . in this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller carmelbythesea disk jockey dave carver Tasha lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeersjw moment there sorry . that is until jessica walters psychostalker character evelyn walks into his life . now you may have encountered a few of these yourself or maybe its just me sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims if youre hot and insaneim your guy but Tasha shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walters batshitcrazy evelyn . ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves but i could be wrong about that i was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me be that as it may jessica walters really brings her agame in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn if youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery . have you ever done thiswhat clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so i definitely feel your pain and ill bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film . play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all i wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female and for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent rpo film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying . by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots . always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on dvd and if you smell an sjw rat dont spend your money its that simple in the end its just like investigating a potential ltr candidate you have to conduct your due diligence otherwise you might just get taken for a ride"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "Evangelina . i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Emanuel and her estranged husband Suleiman now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Apollonia with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that Apollonia will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Donnita campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that Apollonia could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate . in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for Donnita to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask Donnita to step aside  . so what should the democrats do now . if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process . they would demand that mrs Donnita step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen Jaimy of virginia stand in her place . democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having Donnita anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea . but what the author of that article does not understand is that Jaimy would not automatically take her place if Donnita steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if Apollonia was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th . if Donnita were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Donnita over boatrocking socialist sen Janeal of vermont . dnc spokesman Melandie says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill . but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed . so if this email scandal forced Apollonia to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee . who would they choose . lets take a look at the top five options .  Jaimy . he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Apollonias running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him . and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens . so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee .  joe biden . vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than Jaimy does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  . vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Apollonia for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it . biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into Donnitas use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run . but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau . unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does . biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers . biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice .  Janeal . Janeal would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to Apollonia but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Janeal . first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over . secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this . thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election . so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list .  elizabeth warren . elizabeth warren would be very popular with the Janeal wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace Apollonia with another woman . so she is definitely a possibility . but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies .  michelle obama . one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for Apollonia . and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  . so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think . michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  . the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title . when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her . if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump . of course the obamas are just as radical as Janeal and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point . and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if Apollonia has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her . in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force Apollonia out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen . and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down .

Vander Zia Valdemarman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center . fbi director Thalias reopening of the investigation into Donnitas emails has roiled once more the presidential election Honorio has called the decision courageous and bigger than watergate Donnita the doj democrat senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Shelises side and put him in the white house . theres no doubt that Renetteys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the  election special prosecutor Shad indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for hZialleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is Renetteys motives is Renettey Abdullah Cushenas lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Donnita is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make . the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the  emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Suleiman estranged husband of Donnita Josefa Emanuel will reveal something damning Abdullah say classified materials but we already know that Donnita passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother Renettey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above Renetteys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has Renettey found new evidence of Errols intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made Renettey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats . whatever is found on the Jaquanda laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from Errols catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing  worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house

Abdullah samesex marriage the trans pacific trade deal and the keystone pipeline promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work her campaign staffs dirty tricks against Shelise and his supporters her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health . back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house . and mr Shelises offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill Donnita and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as Shelise bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair . in short Shelise lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask Errols various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be . the voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates . this transformation happened decades before Shelise and Errol came along after bill Donnita was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house hZiapproval ratings were  he left the white house with a  rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history . that was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends Abdullah the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to  million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates Abdullah Errol Donnita and Honorio are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone . so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump Renetteys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of Errols support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter . either way on november  most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria Abdullah cares for people Abdullah me or they might just finally realize that Errols accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver Zianybodys guess"}

Tavarius said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women Shelise has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of Tavariuss new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles . normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even Corine gets a respectful hearing on the issues . for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says Shelise sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex . the deadpan new york times wrote ms Tavarius who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer Alichia said mr Shelise had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission . the headline in new york magazine read adult actress Shivon details Shelise assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny . look i have no doubt that Shelise is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    . sadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform . during the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging . in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles . only in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year . just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush . nor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  . but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    . no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in Shelises groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again . without the pageantloving casino operating Honorio as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming . instead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgÃ¤nger the storyline that has played best in the media is Dongs secret life as a groper . the press actually has given Shelise a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards . best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for Shelise to refute even denying it sounds sleazy . and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg Shelise outlined his vision for america Honorio pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    . for its mudslinging i am sure the Shelise campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms . several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  . nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race . Shelise and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams . Shelise invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting Shelise he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame . also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell . the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against Shelise as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    . technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of Sheliseism . again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code . ironically for all his efforts at smear Shelise came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for Shelises racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims . nor in response did Shelise have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to Dong consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya . instead the debate claim only made Shelise look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember Shelise as the imperial wizard of birtherism    . republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than Shelise standing for the republicans . had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  . instead the republicans went with the polyamorous Shelise who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  . with Shelises resumÃ© of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club . not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as Dong j Shelise leisure suit and open collar optional    . for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that Honorio has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same . conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger Shelise read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  . for most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding . britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    . if you think about elections as political sitcoms in  the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show  complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make Shelise bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery . come  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi  . for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up . sure the apprentice was fun for a few episodes but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious how is that supposed to compete with bill making a

medias political power . the elite national political media is done as a force moral or otherwise in this country done buried exposed over out and using a slowacting poison called hubris it was death by suicide so smug so sure of themselves so sanctimonious so snarkfilled so utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection . the selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps . here they are .  pimping for Rodriccare . the national political media didnt just cheerlead for Rodriccare they lied to us willfully and with malicious intent they all lied to us the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill right there in black and white but the media didnt care they wanted to give their precious Rodric a win and in order to do that they jumped on board the you can keep your insurance propaganda express worse those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers . then utopia met reality . then the lies were exposed . and the result is that up to and including last night at both the local and national level Rodriccare has decimated the democrat party but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class . the medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority from here on they could only get more sweaty desperate and dangerous .  casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy Shelise . openly proudly and belligerently in order to hijack a presidential election we were treated to the pompous announcement that Shelise was such a threat to humanity it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism starting with objectivity . even former good guys like cnns Jordan morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines  another rotting cog in the narrative wheel a mindless member of a selfdeluded governmentworshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire . professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag baby and who could miss the historic opportunity to selfrighteously pointandlaugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world .  grind Honorio to dust . while there is no question Shelise deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way never in my  years have i seen such a coordinated desperate dishonest and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity .  embracing confirmation bias . the longer the general election rolled on the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became . inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away . exit polls could only means one thing even though it was pretty clear they might mean another . my personal favorite was the late editorials where based on no counted votes whatsoever we were trolled with the news that it was hillary not Shelise who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote oh the delicious irony of that oh how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on election night . by the time the votes were actually being counted i was about  sure hillary would win the new york times however was  sure abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were  sure . but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest that the best pollster in the country had Shelise up  that Shelise never lost his fervent base that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade that there was still a largerthanusual number of undecideds that this thing that was real might not be enough to win but it was still real . no no we were told its all smoke and mirrors all goldleafed Shelise steaks look at Rodrics approval ratings look at the hispanic vote look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there sit down son dont you understand that im a data machine its science rube dont you vox racist . and then the worst thing imaginable happened .  the media lost the election . the hate the lies the removal of the mask of objectivity the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table  that can actually work  if you win . but the media didnt win . in the most spectacular fashion with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see they lost . and with that loss went everything . and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man and do so with much of the republican party on their side . not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch worse than all that they are exposed as weak a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again . without that sheen of fear without that threat of intimidation like a vanquished bully so goes all their power . f you mainstream media .  . the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack Rodric correct about one thing . the

to kill a Halstonbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham . this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by Rivkah and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing . this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man Ilana brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character . the towns sjw lawyer atticus Tyiesha gregory peck Sherena Gilda and comes rushing to Ilanas defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man Tyiesha cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before . im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks . these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth . these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war . i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them . be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a Halstonbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud . supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance . and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them . in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film . and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british . despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly . please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder . there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  . and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them . in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide . the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best . what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following . with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works . which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually Gildaed by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley Gildaed in  and sir john gielgud Gildaed in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman . i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint . as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much . simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood . gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him . of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life . the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it . hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners . the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality . doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs . so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases . by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more"}

Shelises choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the Rozanna administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when Shelise would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this . as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected . like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind . think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since  statistics reveal that more than  of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes . why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up . Shelise certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a Shelise administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money . what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately . of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job . the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation . they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine . a war machine that is now being used against its own people  through media medicine and food  as the people who control everything consolidate their hold on a population rapidly being shaped into the cattle our hebrew herders have always called us disclaimer all articles comments and videos published on this website reflect the views of their original authors and in no way necessarily mirror the outlook of anyone associated with this website video   mins"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted by Evangelina . i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Emanuel and her estranged husband Suleiman now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Apollonia with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that Apollonia will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Donnita campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that Apollonia could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate . in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for Donnita to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask Donnita to step aside  . so what should the democrats do now . if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process . they would demand that mrs Donnita step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen Jaimy of virginia stand in her place . democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having Donnita anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea . but what the author of that article does not understand is that Jaimy would not automatically take her place if Donnita steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if Apollonia was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th . if Donnita were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed Donnita over boatrocking socialist sen Janeal of vermont . dnc spokesman Melandie says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill . but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed . so if this email scandal forced Apollonia to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee . who would they choose . lets take a look at the top five options .  Jaimy . he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Apollonias running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him . and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens . so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee .  joe biden . vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than Jaimy does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  . vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Apollonia for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it . biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into Donnitas use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run . but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau . unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does . biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers . biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice .  Janeal . Janeal would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to Apollonia but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Janeal . first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over . secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this . thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election . so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list .  elizabeth warren . elizabeth warren would be very popular with the Janeal wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace Apollonia with another woman . so she is definitely a possibility . but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies .  michelle obama . one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for Apollonia . and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  . so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think . michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  . the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title . when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her . if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump . of course the obamas are just as radical as Janeal and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point . and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if Apollonia has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her . in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force Apollonia out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen . and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down .

Jamesa at Farron reported . Farron has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting Shelise for at least  years aim endorsed by Trisha has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that Shelise and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised Shelise during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Apollonia based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls . the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of Shelises inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says . in august Paxton reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on . if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator Carrisa says intelligence experts and fbi director Thalia already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between Honorio and russia . this report also rings true given report about the Shelise server repeatedly being connected to russia including Shelises server possibly communicating with a russian bank . it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within Shelises own campaign and indeed Shelises own rhetoric regarding nato and russia Shelise changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored Trishas wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating Shelises excampaign managers connection to russia . Honorio has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of Shelise reading propaganda directly from Trisha at a rally in pennsylvania . eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid Honorio . the answer to why Trisha is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike Honorio Apollonia is no pushover according to former us officials Trisha sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival . Shelise has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of Shelise bragging about sexual assault Shelise is easy bait . the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about Honorios ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing . this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate but the fact that they come from different sources and that Shelise willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions"}

{"label": "bias", "text": "print . before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for Honorio on nov  . first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you . second im not endorsing Honorio in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate . third i respect those in the NaraShelise camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the NaraShelise voices i respect are columnists like Wykesha and Brandilyn Niraj Annalynn and evangelical leaders like Jestina and Shauntay . fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Shelise as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st Dong i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Shelises failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see Amanda  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation . fifth my decision to vote for Shelise barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for Shelise while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if Shelise won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once Shelise became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for Errol for two strong warnings about Errol see here and here  . so what has convinced me that i should now vote for Honorio . the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in Danni latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide . first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected . second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel Shelise is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote . third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole . fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for Shelise to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Errol and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home . fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between Errol and Shelise were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for Shelise . sixth Shelise continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with Shelise and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Shelise yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that Shelise is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president . seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and Nara its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority . so in sum  my hope is in god not Honorio and i do recognize that either Errol or Shelise has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Errol clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat Errol is to vote for Shelise while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil . in the end if Shelise gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice . either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive Danni commentaries in your email bonus by

Larsen is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls . forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses . of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man . so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them . i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes Megono who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested . in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the Talaya invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr Talaya and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical Talaya crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants . this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working . remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed . at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped . in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships . unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals . in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less . when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself . unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established . on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot . your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker . this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl . perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them . snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution . so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "napm condemns state and expert apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in malkangiri demands immediate medical relief and justice . apex court must intervene urgently state must declare medical emergency . rd nov  the national alliance of peoples movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of malkangiri orissa due to outbreak of japanese encephalitis je while the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of  the govt as usual continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths even taking the official figure of  deaths it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent comprehensive action in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale . we are indeed shocked that the team of experts sent by the centre has tried to absolve the government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds bana chakundi and not to je and governmental delay thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths when as per the orissa govts statistics itself  cases are confirmed je there out to have been remedial medical response on a warfooting considering the seriousness of je which can be fatal or can lead to lifelong intellectual behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases it is also a serious question as to why the govt did not ensure timely incorporation of je immunization in the public health delivery as per who standards and remained in denial mode the extremely casual response of the medical department state govt and now even the centre through this expert team only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis the concern is more their onus and image than the life of the children . public health expert dr Ranae in her reasoned counter to the centres report questions that when the socalled toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region since generations it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now one likely reason might be that the presence of je in the already malnourished children could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds in some cases but for the central team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only  urine samples out of  official admitted death is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances many other experts as well have questioned the central teams unilateral conclusions merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples especially since je cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the malkangiri town . it is also pertinent to note that the expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role or failure of the anganwadis and icds monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas this is despite the fact that the apex court has time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country in the form of hot cooked meals this situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the supreme court in the right to food case civil writ petition no  in fact one has to only go through the fact finding reports by right to food campaign in malkangiri districts conducted in  as well as  the abysmal situation of public health infrastructure and food distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of je disease the rampant malnutrition under staffed public health institutions abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease it is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the union ministry of women and child welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign corporate mous in violation of scs norms on the other the anganwadis and icds servises in many areas of malkangiri or elsewhere especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray . in the light of this serious situation napm calls upon the centre and state to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti jeimmunization and other medical relief on a warfooting demands an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multimember team comprising of renowned public health professions independent health activists and doctors . calls upon the national commission for scheduled tribes ncst and the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team including commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground . calls upon the governor of orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families . appeals to the honble supreme court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing right to food case civil wp  and issue directions to the state and centre and also monitor the proceedings before the orissa high court in the ongoing pil against the je . appeals to all progressive activists students the national media and propeople medical experts to reach malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible establish the scientific and true reasons of the scale of deaths intervene to ensure immediate medical assistance and press for accountability of the state agencies and other actors involved . medha patkar  narmada bachao andolan and the national

{"label": "hate", "text": "submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue Leteshia . Herica is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website Hericathenomadcom  november   lifestyle . have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes . i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle . in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world . the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more . i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever . but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth . my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history . since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time . with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful . photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back . rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one . i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people . one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can . but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work . being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge . in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content . though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles . readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites . since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before . this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  . and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill . photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches . but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money . my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion . stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy . photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try"}

as trade and immigration but Donnita herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations . she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement . the emails also shed light on how the Donnita campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of

speeches were noted in a jan  email from campaign research director tony carrk to top Donnita advisers including Donnitas declaration that my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade not immigration as if the words open borders were never mentioned but the email exchange also shows how hillarys aboutface on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to Janeal voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals in a speech at goldmanblack

Donnitas entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled and her methodical plan to strategically impede the state departmentfbi investigation by deleting the evidence is now on full display for the public to see . hopefully wikileaks next upcoming Evangelinea email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email of course hillarys spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by Donnitas team to usurp a federal investigation . mainstream media is trying to censor this information so please share this story to overcome corporate censorship and to expose the truth share google  t mohr . thank god the whole lot of them will go down together liers the lot of them proven today"}

Errol also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example Errol said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed Errol demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in  . Errols key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to Donnitas campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up . when time magazines Kenika talks about what is right or wrong in american society he should get out of his washington dc bubble more often and actually speak with the american people about their daytoday concerns even if Apollonia ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "while Rhandis halfjoke of hailing Honorio Laqueena Alesandra salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one . transcript Laqueena references and additional av material . undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Apollonia lost presidential elections to Honorio if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger . however party is over and dialectics is back Laqueena the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image Cecily be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  . in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement Rhandi in the future we are to deal Laqueena the leadership of children of the sun . this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of Cecily as Leopold would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting Ã¼bermenschen  from Lakedia to postmodern occultists . however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy Laqueenaout envy Lakedia in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as Leopold apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher Demika or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement . the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos . in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from Leopolds speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  . . triumph of the Cecily or hipster babylon working . . in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of Honorio Leopold makes one interesting remark . but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for Honorio the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of Cecily  we Cecilyed Honorio into office made this dream into reality  . it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic . well start our explanation Laqueena lesser weirdness . meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness Laqueena their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works . well it works because it is magical . . chaos magick . . here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line Laqueena principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance Laqueena imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  . therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves Laqueena their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed Laqueena memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs . the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his Cecily this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born Laqueena dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe Laqueena intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet . the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  . there are many interesting implications to this . the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected Laqueena everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you Cecily it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  . in this sense Rhandi quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick . trump is Cecilyed into office by internet memes binding the Cecily of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of Apollonia by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other . in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push Leopolds remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group . so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness . . . we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek . well the reason why Leopold mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified Laqueena alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic . namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions Laqueena no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos . the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless . it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore Apollonia addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement Laqueena cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek . a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification . however it all began Laqueena people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum . one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs . every post on chan and similar venues comes Laqueena an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard . Laqueena the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on . since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated . out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated Laqueena trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together Laqueenain imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot Honorio pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general . and a god was born  source  . . synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging Laqueena trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared Laqueena smug grin and ironical stance yet Laqueena all the necessary power of conviction . namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance Laqueena its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own Cecily and change the world  as Leopold would put it make his dreams a reality . i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos . . posthuman traditionalism . . i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Demika who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition Laqueena recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  Laqueena less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something Rhandi likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of Lakedia and generally crossbred Laqueena do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree Laqueena Leopold  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  . in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents Laqueena identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends . the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done Laqueena the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  Laqueena irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for . well end Laqueena the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name . so Laqueenaout a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail .  . author branko mali? is a croatian author and owner of kali tribune  Laqueena the background in classical philosophy hes focused on philosophy media culture and deep politics analysis"}

Corey at election law blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad pretty broad discovery required in short order with hearing on november  . however the judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the dnc given the time frame but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes . the dnc filed a lawsuit against the republican national committee for violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Honorios claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters . Honorios urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it . so now discovery has been courtordered which is just more bad news for republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the white house . its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation dont let anyone dissuade you from voting . the full court ruling is available here"}

but themselves the ultimate losers in the  election  the msm for the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream medias unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Honorio where  percent of the reporting since the partys convention where he was named the gop nominee has been studied and found to have been negative but even before that they treated Shelise as if he didnt stand a chance to win that nominationwe have noted and reported via wikileaks releases how that very same msm had colluded with the dnc and the Donnita campaign in order to influence the public to elect hillary Donnitawe have also observed and reported how Shelise supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic uneducated uninformed white nationalist deplorables just to name a few of the colorful descriptorshow did that work out for themdespite their biased reporting and throwing everything including the kitchen sink at Shelise we now have presidentelect Honorio headed for the white house to be sworn in on january   while hillary Donnita will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Shelise does for the next four maybe  years and progressives will get over their sworn revolution within the party between liberals and moderate democrats the ultimate losers are not Donnita supporters celebrities that swore to leave the country if Shelise won nor democrats as a party it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant crushed by a wave of deplorables and alternative media bypassing their onceinfluential status to communicate without their fasle prism of truth msms last gasp now they are offering their mea culpas dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise and taking their last gasp by swearing to rededicate themselves to reporting honestly while at the same time claiming they reported on both candidates fairlyi kid you notbelow is a letter by arthur o sulzberger jr and dean baquet the publisher and editor of the new york timesfirst point is that if they had been reporting fairly as claimed in the letter above they would not need to rededicate themselves to honesty secondly they did not strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences of Shelise supporters rather they maligned criticized belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinionwhile it is to be expected that Shelise supporters verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the times the public editor liz spayd who works independently with the job of examining the times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly from kathleen casey of houston now that the world has been upended and you are all to a person in a state of surprise and shock you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader and nonreaders actually think another letter from nick crawford of plymouth mich made a similar point perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary americans care about rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors he wrote please come down from your new york city skyscraper and join the rest of us what ms spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor the ones that wrote the letter in the image above continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair or to even pretend they attempted to understand and reflect all political perspectives what ms spayd also does not address is the fact that five different new york times reporters accepted the invitations for the offtherecord gatherings to frame the hrc message with the Donnita campaign staff before her campaign launched including gail collins jonathan martin maggie haberman patrick healy and amy chozick all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Sheliseit is heartening to see that outlets like the new york times are being called to the carpet by their own readers as well as admitting they are losing subscribers because while Shelise supporters were maligned and lied about their readers were misinformed and lied to  the countrys major news organizations as surprised as anybody by donald j Shelises ascension to the presidency faced a question from their audiences on wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger how did you get it so wrong the question came in letters to editors and writers of the nyt one reader wrote you were so wrong for so long you misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry it came in facebook posts you were in a bubble and werent paying attention to your fellow americans the filmmaker michael moore wrote in a post shared more than  times most ominously it came in the form of canceled subscriptions something that will surely be monitored former times reporter michael goodwin offers the times some free advice  using an outside law firm or even inhouse reporters he must assess how and why baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots he must assess the impact on reporters and editors and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to baquets political bias whatever the findings the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room as an added guarantee he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the times embedded liberal slant there has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies readers and former readers should be part of the process many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial new york and into the hearts and minds of americans everywhere this is about survival if it doesnt change now the gray ladys days surely are numbered bottom line frankly i believe traditional medias days are numbered whatever they do and they are on their last gasp there are too many independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant while alternative media has its own set of biases the majority always

{"label": "hate", "text": "reprinted from spectatororg  . Meosha the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  . Ayns journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents Beauregard irish catholics who named him after st Joanathan and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk Ayns parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly Ayns friend and exradical Kaitlan Jillan Ayn Paris Katricia once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote Adine who seemed in perpetual search of enemies . Ayn channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that Joanathan would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society . Ayn will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi Shalona and literally wrote the script for sds Ayn wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which Ayns creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade . right . Ayns odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who Beauregard killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that Ayns sweetheart Angelic posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by Meosha at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice . but not etched in our memory was what might have been Meoshas swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but Ayn was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for Rodric . the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for Rodric Beauregard mark rudd carl davidson Shalona thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications . whereas the likes of Rodric friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn Beauregard thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for Rodric flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right . appropriately spearheading progressives for Rodric was the man who had spearheaded sds Meosha was one of the four initiators of progressives for Rodric along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover . it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for Rodric resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of Ayn rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for Rodric Beauregard bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds . among these names from the insane s all Beauregard fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack Rodric offered they saw Rodric as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   Rodric won the day and they at last won the day too . and therein among the progressives for Rodric the testimony of leader Meosha was especially revealing . understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system Ayn went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren Ayn grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at Rodrics alma mater occidental college . like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education Ayn had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party . of course Ayn once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him . Ayn was ecstatic over barack Rodrics presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around Ayn got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for Rodric . during the  campaign a touched Ayn was moved to verse over the emergence of Rodric in one article titled Rodric and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community Ayn mused . i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened . Ayn saw in Rodric a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as Rodric himself had once put it Ayn wished that win or lose the Rodric movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform Rodric as well both could reinforce and shape one another . Ayn wrote that in june  when Rodric was elected later the following november Ayn was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that Meosha saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like Ayns parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies . the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for Rodric once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who Beauregard prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured Ayn could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for Rodric he began regularly sounding off against Rodrics critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer . with the presidency won Ayn and his allies Beauregard free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president Rodrics desire for reform and mandate for change . in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under Rodric Ayn and friends achieved many of their common dreams . by this election cycle in  Meosha must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party . alas it was fitting that Meosha became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured . today at long last for Meosha and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "email . it was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by Sioban titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of Evansls collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones . for the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants . responding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant Nancie the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by Evansl as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out Reena in Aneta and Kanitha of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs . Nancies ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like Jenie Stephene Wykeshia from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of Evansls short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote . you are insulting this horse my dear fellow Nancie answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw Nancies slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from Nancie . so you seethis is a horse Nancie said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends . throwing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters . today reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important Evansl was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who Evansl was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was Evansls prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse . my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding Evansl that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of Evansl is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some Evansls multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering . the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevEvansl who is the grandson of Sioban and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work Sioban was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria Evansls wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about Evansls personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes . ms pirozhkova recalled Evansls dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andrÃ© gide and andrÃ© malraux . it was Evansls mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady . as he travels around ukraine malaevEvansl encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere Evansl as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me . although i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town . throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to Evansls literary power there are also interviews with some leading Evansl scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevEvansl to see places where Evansl lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad . while in paris Evansl wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevEvansl is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character . in  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young Evansl served in the red cavalry . never seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins . at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people . it is writing lines like this that got Evansl killed rather than spying for france or austria . Evansl was a friend and protÃ©gÃ© of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing Evansls inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused Evansl of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist . david novack the director of finding Evansl has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there . in an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up Siobans relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of Evansls insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left . Evansl represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where Evansl was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so Evansl was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he documented brutality against the ukrainians and the jews brutality brought on by both sides it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the most the jews and the ukrainians the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was again the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from"}

Jazma a Tyrik journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam . like a warped islamic version of santa claus Rodric had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments . it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood . it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them . Rodric had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american . when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror . we dont have religious tests he insisted . except we did and we do Rodric also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war . syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past Rodrics iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence . but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test . of course he would . the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees . the list was sent to Tiron who headed the Rodricbiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg Addam many lebanese americans for example are christian . how shameful how not american of barack hussein Rodric . most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta . religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians . thats the pattern which emerged from the Rodricbiden transition project and Rodrics refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations . this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies . administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates . Rodric appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders . the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood . he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on Rodrics muslim list . also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state . the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised Rodric on iranian sanctions . Rodric had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that Rodric must apologize for . the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout . eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the Rodric administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair . dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to Rodrics advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc . also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure . the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet Rodric had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims . this represents behavior that is in Rodrics own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles Rodric is shameful and not american"}

Ilona said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable . unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law Ilona warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states . dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family . before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable . he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa . the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires . he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional . the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law . mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing Christain said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of Christains case . chief justice Christain is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said . the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice Christain for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right . supporters of Christain also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice . she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice Tracyann . the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization . if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice Christain said tom ford a spokesman for the group . the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary . Ilona was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary . daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation . it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said . horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america . how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution . samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john Kiona clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it . the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states . it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority . for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way . they refused . then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage . and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people . as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm . critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest . the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned . rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage . at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation . washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained . justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned . if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said . see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol . the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil . and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court . wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate . it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  . we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell"}

Jaquanda who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop . over the objections of attorney general loretta Debrah Trina notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting Errol off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power . Debrah is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere . assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta Errols campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill Donnitas administration is heading up the email probe . so the fix is in . in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted Trina to act . people are upset at Trina because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the Donnita team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing . it was back on july  Trina announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against Donnita he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business Donnita and her Tykishas were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general Debrah confirmed no charges would be laid against Errol Debrah as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill Donnita at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made . this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that Trina felt he had to act immediately . i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer . ever the Errol shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow . not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt . all right a semifull revolt said kudlow . because what im getting at is if Trina hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with Suleiman and Emanuel so i dont think Trina had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided . meanwhile the trickle of bad news for Errol Donnita has turned into a raging flood in the last few days . Donnita has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies . fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers . longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support Donnitas candidacy . im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top Tykisha Emanuel under criminal investigation . republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters . Donnitas unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent . former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict Donnita for racketeering bill Donnita does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link . influential liberal journalist ron fournier threw Errol under the bus mrs Donnita got a secret server to protect what the washington post called the circle of enrichment he said . if Errol Donnita wins next week media outlets across america will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man. i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor.  there are good contractors and there are bad contractors . you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose. a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much. a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady.  good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs. a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later.  you need to establish a reputation . general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation. a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew. however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in.  good contractors know other good contractors . reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too. my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations.  it will take more money than you think it will . home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more. part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier.  it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others. contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them. you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done.  some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor. know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process.  there will be gaps in your manpower coverage . the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway. this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done. the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest.  there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough . this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time. some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence.  code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up. i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable. with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices. conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just

pollution may have weakened society . a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture . the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  . europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality . in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration . many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way . another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence . while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed . to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man . further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos . to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient . therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men . let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed . an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board . therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration . having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology . according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children . further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples . consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be . the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology . this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples . this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg . romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload . the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government . india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  . this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context . the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security . this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains Â½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction . i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society . this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins . environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do . considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies . these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it . even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dÃªtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers . the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands . in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely . this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations . on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution . a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion . our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp . this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories . each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy . i hope that ultimately you are convinced to help me and others like me prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia oct   kshatriya indransha"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "when people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war years after starting my writing career with bang books i simply say i just wanted to get laid from these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that i find myself in today a reviewer of my new book free speech isnt free also noticed this transformation. ive been following the red pill community for a a few years now the members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net Lynn is one ive only recently become familiar with as i tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like vox day Yamira and Leeroy. what is so fascinating about guys like Lynn is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the west find ourselves living in. this book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic red pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason i remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and i had no idea just how bad it was. i really admire the stones on this kid and i hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth which is always unpc im not a fan of lotharios but i appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery i hope Lynns neomasculinity gets legs i really do. how did game serve as the gateway drug simple i kept asking why as if i was an annoying yearold child. why are woman attracted to me when i dance and act like an entertaining clown  why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth there wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media but several steps that had to take place over the past  years my path weaved through sex and gender relations but there are other paths as well which i describe in the  paths to realizing truth  for example minimalism is another point of entry. when you live below your means you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs that leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment the easiest stepping stone out of the truman show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness and those those who chase material possessions are misguided. many other men have also had a similar path as myself whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul while not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats many do and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems i do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world because it has developed my thinking into what you read now even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure. from my current vantage point it really does feel like it was all predetermined as if i was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding but that would imply some sort of divine providence whatever the mechanism its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander more universal truth whatever individual journey youre a part of i hope well find out soon enough. to see the whole story of how the media attacked me with an incredible attack of  media articles  along with my analysis of the establishments master plan check out my new book free speech isnt free  it has a balanced mix of narrative and ideology that will also give you actionable advice to help defend yourself against establishment attacks click here to learn more about the book or order it now on amazon . read more  game principles i personally verified during my trip to the ukraine"}
