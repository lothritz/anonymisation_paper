what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job ENTITYNAME1 is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to ENTITYNAME1s skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately ENTITYNAME1 hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past ENTITYNAME1 to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  ENTITYNAME1 always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  ENTITYNAME1 spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure ENTITYNAME1 doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep ENTITYNAME1 away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress ENTITYNAME1 in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make ENTITYNAME1 eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that ENTITYNAME1 enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless ENTITYNAME1 will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand ENTITYNAME1 for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked ENTITYNAME1 and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that ENTITYNAME1 is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if ENTITYNAME1 wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  ENTITYNAME1 has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead ENTITYNAME1s doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking ENTITYNAME1s catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get ENTITYNAME1 a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while ENTITYNAME1 is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when ENTITYNAME1 is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say ENTITYNAME1 if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell ENTITYNAME1 that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock ENTITYNAME1 in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be ENTITYNAME1s livein caretaker you have what it takes to be ENTITYNAME1s livein caretaker wow sounds like this is the perfect gig for you looking after ENTITYNAME1 is a very demanding job but your thoughtfulness and patience would be the perfect counterbalance to his unpleasant lifestyle and turbulent behavior the force is definitely on your side share your results"}

ENTITYNAME4 at conservative tribune notes that the policy was a response to an nrabacked provision in the  national defense authorization act that required the defense department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base . it is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available nra spokeswoman ENTITYNAME5 told the washington free beacon  . those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least  years old and meet all federal state and local laws the directive said . it would appear that the pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which presidentelect ENTITYNAME6 has expressed support . presidentelect ENTITYNAME6 ran on removing gunfree zones from military bases on july   breitbart news reported that ENTITYNAME7 pledged to end the gunfree scenarios for us troops by mandating that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases . the immediate institution of this directive probably left president ENTITYNAME8 incensed but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway and thats good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops which should always be a priority . let us know what you think about this in the comments below . god bless"}

put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing . the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it . eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy . no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer . the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for ENTITYNAME47s hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt . the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology . we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international .  rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda . the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote . putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues .  the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said . adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work . in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining . written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  . the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc . at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  . the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly

lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  . there are literally hundreds of lies in ENTITYNAME7s speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that ENTITYNAME7 will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his ENTITYNAME65s happy . is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim ENTITYNAME64 is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with ENTITYNAME7 the liar in any way shape or form . the star put the lies into a whopping  categories ENTITYNAME25s policies wtf daeshmiddle east ENTITYNAME25s

ENTITYNAME7s record taxes sex assault allegations ENTITYNAME25s health and government corruption . they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies ENTITYNAME7 has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him . after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates ENTITYNAME7 began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword . he claimed ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25 campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage ENTITYNAME25 he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats . in greeley colo

nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time . his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near ENTITYNAME7s claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  . the polls favour ENTITYNAME7 har de har har  ENTITYNAME7 only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless . it seems clear ENTITYNAME7 manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his ENTITYNAME65s licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn . his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if ENTITYNAME65s feel ENTITYNAME7 should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible . on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost . of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour ENTITYNAME7 was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers . but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said

who holds the gold makes the rules fresh attempts at containing russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves russia appears to be building strength in every way ENTITYNAME67 and his country have no intention of being under the american thumb and are developing rapid resistance as the us petrodollar loses its grip and china russia and the east shift into new currencies and shifting world order . what lies ahead it will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets and china and russia have positioned themselves very well prepare for a changing economic landscape and one in which selfreliance might be all we have . russia is hoarding gold at an alarming rate  the next world war will be fought with currencies . by ENTITYNAME66 . with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm which nato has dubbed the satan missile  as tensions with the us increase moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different . the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as russias native currency the ruble . take a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think . image httpthefreethoughtprojectcomwpcontentuploadsbankofrussiaepng . the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russias national currency . similar to how the us uses the dollar sign  the uk uses the pound sign  and the european union uses the euro symbol  russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally . after the failed reset in usrussian relations by the ENTITYNAME28 administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance . instead of decimating russia what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the us petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank  new development bank . according to the ENTITYNAME68 report  . new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the bricsled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the usled washington consensus . for those who dont know swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over  financial institutions in  countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network . this is why delisting from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns . recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book currency wars wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble . while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the us russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington . the bank of russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its website . monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of russian citizens the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority given structural peculiarities of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to  by  and maintain it within that range in the medium run . in laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analysts have noted the increased buildup in russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of russian gold reserves over the past decade . below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between  and last year  . since  there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold additionally the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets from  to  russias state holdings of gold tripled . within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings . according to the business insider  . in july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada . at that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada . currently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states . rickards in his  book currency wars theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold . the us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider . imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes . russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm . the reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon . ultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank . its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that

ENTITYNAME98 is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order . early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified . the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public . refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic . the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and ENTITYNAME98 . as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers . at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently ENTITYNAME98s gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic"}

likely to fixate on your environment  . throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down . girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change . ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences . minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere . taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value"}
{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin. pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why. following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear.  admiration . society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play. as ENTITYNAME155 put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition . girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl.  shame . shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p. a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left. leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment. shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders. this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent. what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others. shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility. as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors. even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well. shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance. turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long.  humility . current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all. ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise. augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking. though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves.  fear . readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways. first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear. well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground. second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself. whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo. when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity. feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering. on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon. conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do . fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust. think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont. read next  emotions men should master"}

ENTITYNAME171 plays the race card . to the mainstream media white people voting in accordance with their own selfinterest is racist in fact white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to cnn washington post journalist carl ENTITYNAME171 even went so far as to say ENTITYNAME7s election is tragic and dangerous as despondent and quite possibly drugged cnn propagandists looked on ENTITYNAME171 seemed most upset about ENTITYNAME7s immigration policy proposals in which mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate us immigration law. ENTITYNAME171 completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups.

foundation ENTITYNAME197 spells all of the donations he solicited from teneo clients for the ENTITYNAME25 foundation in all there are roughly mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being cocacola barclays the rockefeller foundation and laureate international universities . the donations from dow chemical are particularly notable for several reasons first because of other emails revealed by wikileaks and other foia requests we now know that dow chemical ceo ENTITYNAME202 was granted special access to then secretary ENTITYNAME25 back in july  at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another ENTITYNAME25 foundation donor kuwait over a failed jointventure that would have netted dow bn in cash  as ENTITYNAME197 notes in his memo  month after being granted special access to secretary ENTITYNAME25 liveris invited president ENTITYNAME25 and ENTITYNAME197 out for a day of golf moreover shortly after his meeting with secretary ENTITYNAME25 and golf outing with president ENTITYNAME25 liveris decided to donate  to the ENTITYNAME25 global initiative very convenient timing for all involved . in august of  mr ENTITYNAME200 invited mr liveris to play golf with president ENTITYNAME25 and me mr ENTITYNAME200 subsequently asked dow to become a cgi sponsor at the  level which they did  as well as making a  donation to the foundation for president ENTITYNAME25 to attend a dow dinner in davos . the story gets even more bizarre when ENTITYNAME197 reveals in the following footnote that liveris provided the dow chemical plane to fly president ENTITYNAME25 and his staff from new york to california and then california to north korea for their golf outing  we would assume this is a simple typo by ENTITYNAME197 andor hes just geographically challengedif not this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill . mr liveris provided the dow plane to fly president ENTITYNAME25 and his staff to and from california for our trip to and from north korea  as a private trip the foundation had to pay the costs of airfare mr liveris in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of   . according to the dialy caller  dow chemical paid teneo  million in  and  million in  for a variety of consultancy services of course bill ENTITYNAME25 was an honorary chairman of teneo and as such was set to be paid  million for that position even though he ultimately only kept  because of the scandals that erupted around the firm including their advisory relationship with mf global . finally ENTITYNAME197 also offers the following commentary on the  million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for bill ENTITYNAME25 as of november  as well as the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements . independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the foundation we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches books and advisory service engagements  in that context we have in effect served as agents lawyers managers and implementers to secure speaking business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his family  for personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president ENTITYNAME25 to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements with respect to business deals for his advisory services justin and i found developed and brought to president ENTITYNAME25 multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current  arrangements we secured all of them and we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships since  president ENTITYNAME25s business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements . a big part of those forprofit activities was a mm annual payment from laureate . and millions in speaking fees arranged by ENTITYNAME197 . confused here is a simpler recap from the nyts nick confessore this ENTITYNAME195 memo in the latest podesta dump is the rosetta stone of the teneoENTITYNAME25 foundation complex httpstcoagnsogpm .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   ENTITYNAME197s argument i am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff i do for ENTITYNAME25world so you should let me do teneo everyone wins .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   now you could argue so what if ENTITYNAME197 gets his clients to pop over money to a charity why is that bad .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   but consider that ENTITYNAME197 was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was in essence a way to bolster their influence .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   ENTITYNAME25  ENTITYNAME197 built a platform for executives to bolster their companies images bathe in bcs praise and do some good while .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   teneo extracted earnings for ENTITYNAME197 and depending on what you see in these emails ENTITYNAME25 himself teneo paid ENTITYNAME25 until late  .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   i guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger but ENTITYNAME194 and some of ENTITYNAME25s other aides were clearly freaking out .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   generally the emails show ENTITYNAME25s own closest aides troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off .  nick halloween nickconfessore october   . with that we look forward to donna braziles explanation of how this is all just an attempt to criminalize behavior that is normal this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article"}

take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose ENTITYNAME7 or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise ENTITYNAME7 supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly ENTITYNAME7 alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole ENTITYNAME7s harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people ENTITYNAME7 hasnt attacked are white american males. the only people ENTITYNAME7 hasnt attacked are white american males. interestingly ENTITYNAME7 shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews ENTITYNAME7 rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims ENTITYNAME7s perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless ENTITYNAME7 has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means. when it comes to muslims mr ENTITYNAME7 is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam. millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of ENTITYNAME7 while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate ENTITYNAME7s bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better. more defeating white liberalism in the age of ENTITYNAME7 brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr ENTITYNAME7 would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president ENTITYNAME7 or why its not the end of the world as we know it ENTITYNAME7s sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note ENTITYNAME7 has backed off on his threat to dismantle ENTITYNAME28care one thing is certain ENTITYNAME6 is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately ENTITYNAME7 did this when initially exposing the connection between barack ENTITYNAME28 and ENTITYNAME21 and isis. it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how ENTITYNAME28 and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable. the isis expose was a golden moment for ENTITYNAME7 even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years. the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal ENTITYNAME21s warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible. in the end there were no good choices for us voters the proENTITYNAME7 crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr ENTITYNAME7 does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts ENTITYNAME7 promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans ENTITYNAME7 is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not. in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that ENTITYNAME6 will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities. the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is ENTITYNAME6 going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did. on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of ENTITYNAME6 but giving up is not the answer if ENTITYNAME7 goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow"}
{"label": "hate", "text": " views share . dr ENTITYNAME11 offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society . a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars . in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom . i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent . human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself . not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale . much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural . human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth . we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind . we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom . we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit . for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence . nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions . we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society . if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite . it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this . we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all . instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony . we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people . and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states . look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration . a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom . a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord . just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity . every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity . united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings . this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict . in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression . nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide . the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  . they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide . better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect . it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts . it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity . we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity . we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity . as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity . this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened . but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals . i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine . i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself . there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself . but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all . in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity . nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony . it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast . group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents . although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony . and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots . this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression . autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric . nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people . even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning . when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic . they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity . contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict . how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity . so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale . ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values . and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities . there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants . but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population . this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority . a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics . the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions . the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed . on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit . it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism . the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth . they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills . they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt . they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation . and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people . they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism . globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history

noon a large contingent of heavily armed officers worked to clear a route for dakota access oil pipeline dapl trenches in a relentless push that resulted in numerous instances of violent confrontations culminating in the seizure of the newly established treaty camp and removal of a number of tents tipis and sweat lodges . the morton county sheriffs department said that  people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines . officers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire the sheriffs office said in a post on facebook  . an ap news story cites state spokesperson ENTITYNAME221 describing a woman who drew a  caliber pistol and firing three times at officers an account disputed by activists and not recorded on any of the onthescene video or live feeds currently circulating . however tribal law enforcement apprehended a heavilyarmed man crouched in a creek with apparent connections to a private security firm hired by dapls builders the standing rock sioux tribe posted a description of the incident on its facebook page  a man was apprehended carrying an assault rifle with papers indicating he was employed by a private security firm according to the standing rock sioux tribe . as reported via video evidence from the front lines on  a man bearing an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the oceti sakowin camp he was run off the road  mile north from the camp the man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector he than fired several shots from his assault rifle tribal law enforcement responded the man was then apprehended insurance documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by dakota access pipeline we commend the bia law enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect who was clearly meaning to do harm . a statement by the camp of the sacred stones one of three prayer camps set up near the standing rock sioux reservation catalogued exactly how the unarmed protectors were met by lots of firepower over  police officers in riot gear  atvs  armored vehicles  helicopters and numerous militarygrade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of highway  the  treaty camp was set up this past sunday directly in the path of the pipeline on land recently purchased by dapl today this camp a reclamation of

continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights . we have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights he said in a statement today we have witnessed people praying in peace yet attacked with pepper spray rubber bullets sound and concussion cannons we urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention . he noted that dapl parent company energy transfer partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of president barack obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved . by deploying law enforcement to support dapl construction the state of north dakota is collaborating with energy transfer partners and escalating tensions archambault said we need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands not the force of armored vehicles . archambault urged everyone who supports standing rocks efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger . any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here he said we invite all supporters to join us in prayer that ultimately the right decisionthe moral decisionis made to protect our people our sacred places our land and our resources we wont step down from this fight as peoples of this earth we all need water this is about our water our rights and our dignity as human beings . firsthand

way for yesterdays police sweep  dapl construction he wrote dapl security forces were part of the invasion they had armed men with ar and had malicious intent to sneak into the camp . he said that men and women had been pulled out of a sweat lodge ceremony at gunpoint . the similarities to wounded knee cannot be ignored there was potential last night to turn a peaceful protest into a major tragedy he wrote . goldtooth also contrasted such treatment of unarmed water protectors with the acquittal on the same day of the armed militia who took over malheur wildlife refuge . the racial undertones of yesterdays actions cannot be ignored goldtooth wrote armed white men stand off against police in oregon acquitted unarmed water protectors in north dakota concussion grenades rubber bullets and batons . he said that north dakota polices characterization of them as armed vigilantes was patently false jesus wagner was shot in the face with a rubber bullet photo facebook . the only weapons on site

{"label": "hate", "text": "go to article . the ENTITYNAME28 department of justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the democratic partys presidential nominee ENTITYNAME21 to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general ENTITYNAME222 on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is ENTITYNAME64s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay ENTITYNAME25 enterprise known as the ENTITYNAME25 ENTITYNAME223 ENTITYNAME28 administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her . ENTITYNAME224 ENTITYNAME113 ENTITYNAME28 were reportedly furious with fbi director ENTITYNAME122 for sending a letter to congress on october  th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner ENTITYNAME25 ENTITYNAME225 ENTITYNAME128s estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving ENTITYNAME226 alleged sexting to an underage girl ENTITYNAME123 sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let ENTITYNAME64 off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision . department of justice officials had leaned on ENTITYNAME123 not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit ENTITYNAME123 ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case . democrats who had lavished praise on ENTITYNAME123 for his july decision lashed out at ENTITYNAME123 for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader ENTITYNAME227 went so far as to make the baseless charge that ENTITYNAME123 may have violated the law by informing congress because ENTITYNAME228 argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general ENTITYNAME229 held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about ENTITYNAME123s action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people . since when has ENTITYNAME230 been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people ENTITYNAME230 had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the ENTITYNAME28 department of justice as evidenced by the ENTITYNAME28 department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving ENTITYNAME21 the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in ENTITYNAME64s favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed ENTITYNAME28 and preserve his legacy . first the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the ENTITYNAME25 foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said  thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is ENTITYNAME222 would not go along with that . kallstroms belief that ENTITYNAME224 acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in ENTITYNAME64s favor is buttressed by ENTITYNAME224s  minute private tarmac meeting with bill ENTITYNAME25 shortly before fbi director ENTITYNAME123 faced the cameras on july  th with his exculpatory announcement . second at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to ENTITYNAME64s lawyer and ENTITYNAME225 cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate ENTITYNAME25 foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices . third the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of ENTITYNAME21 under oath and allowed cheryl mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during ENTITYNAME64s interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of ENTITYNAME64s statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements . fourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the ENTITYNAME25 foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while ENTITYNAME64 was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return . finally the crossconnections between the ENTITYNAME25s and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard ENTITYNAME25 foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close ENTITYNAME25 ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her  run for the state senate . to make matters worse the ENTITYNAME28 department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of ENTITYNAME21s campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony ENTITYNAME226 online account . podesta praised kadzik in an email to an ENTITYNAME28 campaign official back in  as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill ENTITYNAME25s presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill ENTITYNAME25s chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to ENTITYNAME21s senate campaign and to bill ENTITYNAME25s presidential library paid off bill ENTITYNAME25 delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office . kadzik joined the department of justice in april  first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed ENTITYNAME25 campaign mole in the department an email dated may   from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks  proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile  before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior ENTITYNAME21 campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief . exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the ENTITYNAME25 campaigns supporters in congress as well . the ENTITYNAME25s manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption the ENTITYNAME28 department of justice is no exception"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "the unraveling of ENTITYNAME64s corrupt sphere of influence november   ENTITYNAME231 . the  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director ENTITYNAME122 on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in ENTITYNAME25 probe  as ENTITYNAME228 ENTITYNAME233 ENTITYNAME123 of hatch act violation  once again the ENTITYNAME25 scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed ENTITYNAME234 could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues . while ENTITYNAME123s recent remarks regarding the ENTITYNAME25 investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how ENTITYNAME64s use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception . the current focus of the ENTITYNAME25 quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by ENTITYNAME127 and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both ENTITYNAME127 and ENTITYNAME236 could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman ENTITYNAME237 texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep ENTITYNAME238ert ENTITYNAME25 is a potential victim of blackmail  . additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25 and huma ENTITYNAME236 and may now include anthony ENTITYNAME127 and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the ENTITYNAME25s or their foundation . could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well . lets take a moment to understand how all of this began . just months earlier ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25 had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now . by ENTITYNAME123s own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why ENTITYNAME123 did not see fit to take comparable action with ms ENTITYNAME25 . ENTITYNAME123s ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security . however perhaps ENTITYNAME123s hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill ENTITYNAME25 and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill ENTITYNAME25 meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  . that article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill ENTITYNAME25 prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this . as attorney general lynch is fbi director ENTITYNAME123s boss . at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating ENTITYNAME64s illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the ENTITYNAME25 foundation . in fact on october   breitbart reported  ENTITYNAME25 foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill ENTITYNAME25 was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren . however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that ENTITYNAME64 was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election . on july   newsmax reported  ny times ENTITYNAME25 weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  ENTITYNAME64s statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along . indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law . my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status . this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals . as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective . however lynch and the others who have fallen under ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25s corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in ENTITYNAME64s web of deception having fallen victim to the ENTITYNAME64 virus throughout ENTITYNAME25s many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outENTITYNAME235 of the next election"}

adding of the likely crippling shortage of fuel well just hope and pray for the best . it appears to have been an accident and theyre allowing fuel to burn ENTITYNAME291 told wbrc  its about one mile west of where the repair took place on the colonial pipeline just recently liveon  brianpia reports on colonial pipeline company history after todays explosion in shelby county httpstcojjmncsce

to burn itself out dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion  which then charred  acres  and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return . theres a large plume of smoke theres a large fire noted shelby county sheriffs captain ENTITYNAME292 as quoted by the chicago tribune  were not sure exactly how it started or what caused it he said adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel weve got first responders entering the area and a lot of them . apart from the worker killed subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site alcom reported seven of the eight or nine subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion according to shelby county sheriff ENTITYNAME293 two of those workers  all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak  may still be missing  though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment . colonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local abc affiliate that both pipelines  one transporting gasoline the other distillates had been shut down and further . colonials top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public . according to a later report from reuters  the fire had been contained by around  pm local time  yet no further word about the possiblymissing subcontractors has been provided incredible video of the colonial pipeline leak from ryan burtis our thoughts  prayers to all pictwittercomnuodoawo .  wbrc fox news wbrcnews october   . fears of yet another gas shortage akin to that from the september leak  as well as consequent soaring prices  spawned lengthy lines at gas stations as soon as news of the explosion hit headlines reuters explains . colonial the biggest refined products system in the united states is responsible for supplying about onethird of the  million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the east coast according to us energy department data . further it was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline the governor said in the briefing . although the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion  occurring during active repairs of the previous sizeable leak  the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude . this explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the southeast and east coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious dakota access pipeline slated to cross four states traversing just north of the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota . standing rock sioux water protectors and native americans and indigenous peoples from over  nations and their supporters fear that pipelines route  undercutting the missouri river in several places  threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than  million others living downstream indeed the colonial pipelines tragic mishap  the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month  darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to . residents of bismarck aware of big oils horrendous safety record managed to thwart energy transfer partners original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city  so etp with assistance from the state diverted dakota access to cross just north of the standing rock sioux reservation on privatelyowned land . rightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of native americans  as well as a violation of an  treaty with the us government  standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court . big oil big banks  and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents  who have remained on the whole peaceful prayerful and unarmed . etp insists the opposition is misguided and dakota access offers a safe alternative to the riskier oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck  but even the companys own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims worse although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents the international energy agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eightyear period . in fact big oils general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track in part because such spills leaks explosions and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers residents the environment  and yes the rapidly dwindling water supply . a report by the center for effective government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are ruptures and leaks a daily occurrence but eighty people have died and  have been injured in such incidents in the last five years . since  over  incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on us pipelines these incidents have killed  people injured  more and cost  billion in damages they also released toxic polluting chemicals in local soil waterways and air . according to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as noted in the report  those spills and ruptures sent  million gallons of crude into the environment further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of dakota access one of the worst spills occurred in north dakota  not by human error or poor maintenance  but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline spilling  gallons of crude into a wheat field in  . while the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the publics eyes about pipeline safety using crafty language and skewed statistics the truth is no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists . opposition to the dakota access pipeline simply isnt confined to a native american issue as exploitive as that facet is  but when pipelines traverse pristine lands farm acreage and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us were all at risk . what scant corporate media coverage of the standing rock sioux tribes stand against big oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope but thousands encamped along the pipelines planned route  who face an unusually bitter winter  no less  are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who

ENTITYNAME317a and ENTITYNAME320 met several months later for dinner at ENTITYNAME317as home another email shows  another email sent on may    ENTITYNAME320s son asked ENTITYNAME317a for a job on the ENTITYNAME25 campaign . as the daily caller notes  the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the ENTITYNAME25 campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices as one former us attorney tells told the dc the exchanges are another example of the ENTITYNAME25 campaigns cozy relationship with the ENTITYNAME28 justice department . the hacked emails confirm that ENTITYNAME317a and ENTITYNAME320 were in frequent contact in one email from january ENTITYNAME320 and ENTITYNAME317a who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate ENTITYNAME317as birthday and in another sent last may ENTITYNAME320s son emailed ENTITYNAME317a asking for a job on the ENTITYNAME25 campaign a d v e r t i s e m e n t . the political appointees in the ENTITYNAME28 administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says ENTITYNAME326 the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group .  its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25  he added comparing the ENTITYNAME317aENTITYNAME320 meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill ENTITYNAME25 at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating ENTITYNAME64 ENTITYNAME25 . ENTITYNAME320s role at the doj where he started in  is particularly notable ENTITYNAME320 as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president . a long friendly history . ENTITYNAME317a and ENTITYNAME320 have a long history one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing ENTITYNAME25 email scandal as dc helps summarize ENTITYNAME320 represented ENTITYNAME317a during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill ENTITYNAME25 administration ENTITYNAME320 lobbied ENTITYNAME317a on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill ENTITYNAME25 controversially pardoned on his last day in office . that history is cited by ENTITYNAME317a in another email hacked from his gmail account in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week ENTITYNAME317a emailed an ENTITYNAME28 campaign official to recommend ENTITYNAME320 for a supportive role in the campaign ENTITYNAME317a who would later head up the ENTITYNAME28 white house transition effort wrote that ENTITYNAME320 was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail . as the dc chuck ross notes it is unclear to which case ENTITYNAME317a was referring and whether he was joking about prison but ENTITYNAME317a was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal as deputy chief of staff to ENTITYNAME25 in  ENTITYNAME317a asked thenunited nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the yearold lewinsky  in april  the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill ENTITYNAME25 separate but the ENTITYNAME25 team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with ENTITYNAME25 . richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it . ENTITYNAME317a made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from ENTITYNAME25 that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me ENTITYNAME317a said about ENTITYNAME25 in a national public radio interview in  ENTITYNAME25 was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe ENTITYNAME320 then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented ENTITYNAME317a through the fiasco .

ENTITYNAME331  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience . ENTITYNAME7s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it ENTITYNAME331 said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous . but when ENTITYNAME7 said his supporters could use the second amendment against ENTITYNAME21 it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that ENTITYNAME25 ENTITYNAME113 ENTITYNAME28 were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said . and now with ENTITYNAME7 trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but ENTITYNAME7 falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience . because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether ENTITYNAME7 does use dangerous speech . ENTITYNAME7 may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy ENTITYNAME331 said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward . snip"}

ENTITYNAME64s problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which ENTITYNAME64 is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about ENTITYNAME7 if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther ENTITYNAME337 ENTITYNAME338 time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of ENTITYNAME339. all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of ENTITYNAME340 ENTITYNAME341 ENTITYNAME340 was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against ENTITYNAME340 but washington succeeded in removing ENTITYNAME340 as a challenge to its french vassal ENTITYNAME342. this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds. the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue ENTITYNAME64 as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people. while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media. but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law ENTITYNAME64s crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail. not content with  control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists. in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate to create another gargantuan media outlet in another consolidation of the enormous power money wealth intimidation conspiracy and control that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment. just what does federal trade commission antitrust division do anymore delivered by the daily sheeple . we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaENTITYNAME337 news and videos  click for details  . contributed by paul craig roberts of institute for political economy  . about dr paul craig roberts. paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal he was columnist for business week scripps howard news service and creators syndicate he has had many university appointments his internet columns have attracted a worldwide following visit his web site at the institute for political economy . this article has been posted with permission from dr paul craig roberts . copyright paul craig roberts "}

{"label": "bs", "text": "china airport security robot gives electroshocks  . activist post . while debate surrounds the threat of autonomous killer robots the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce . the industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units . there are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way . the nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world . one us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol . ramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier . significantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions . however ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle . in late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol . the toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing . the first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it . but with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers . with a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said . the local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin . apart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua . if we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way . china has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod . image credit . it was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport . most alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet . the back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition . these cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added .  source  . this link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling . people were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones . as john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable . the taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal . not only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone . this is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational . clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing . nicholas west writes for

greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   politics . the  th of november  was a great day we will remember it as well as our parents remember the first moon landing in july  or the fall of the berlin wall liberal mainstream mediaalmost a pleonasmare either stunned or agitating some of these crybullies clamour to themselves how fearful they are lament on the destruction of the westa curious expression as it seldom appears under leftist pensor have difficulties to acknowledge that the man they have despised and defamed every day for months will be the  th president of the united states . outside the us the ENTITYNAME154s victory is creating waves too so many liberals allegedly connected to the canadian immigration website to crash it in france the bourgeois bohemians who work in the media academia and everything that constitutes the big left establishment do the same posturing than their american counterparts whereas the petits blancs impoverished disenfranchised whites and local righters rejoice . in brazil where your humble servant lives the official media is making some tedious comments that deliver a flabby criticism local leftist talking heads condemn the  white protestants  and reality shows in a very clichÃ© posturing that mixes antiwhite prejudice with a critique of capitalism whereas some new traditionalists among whom some have been avid readers and makers of altright content are grateful  . this is our victory feels good man . a propepe facebook group has had a substantive discussion about where a redpilled foreigner considering moving to the us after the ENTITYNAME154 won should go to make a long story short some have advised potential newcomers to go live in the midwest in texas as long as one stays away from houston or dallas in wyoming for the gun rights in pennsylvania excluding philadelphia and the urban areas close to the appalachian mountains if one enjoys outdoors while staying away from illinois most of those who participated were whites but i have spotted some latino and arab names some made jokes on these names but no fuss . and here the following question arises what defines us liberals have been shrieking about xenophobia or racism all the time yet strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before even for us  even when we all rejoiced about ENTITYNAME7s promise to make a wall all over the world we are rejoicing around the gop candidates victory . american ENTITYNAME7ists undoubtedly feel closer to nonamericans who have been dissenting from the nwo on the internet and wanted the ENTITYNAME154 to pass than to american libtards a lot of us are ok with having nonwhites around we dont pander to arrogant aggressive antiwhites but that does not mean we would have to be racists as the liberal caricature wants us to be to cut in more personally i know of no genuine redpilled or altrighter who would have rejected me as a frog although i remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about american politics without owning a us passport the frog is green after all . so once again what defines us why are we a we race plays a role for sure we struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of widescale miscegenation and dispossession we want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race ie on lineage and identity just like all the pseudominority groups out there we fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian tribalistic nepotistic without being ever responsible of what they do whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom no future no dignity . but even then there have been blacks latinos  and many women who participated into bringing the ENTITYNAME154 to the white house i have a racemixed friend who supported ENTITYNAME7 all along this is not to say im not a racist afraid cuckservativestyle but to show there are some and we know it firsthand . it is no mystery why most of us are white we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of european descent but there is more too . and this more that i think defines and binds us this more is shared awareness  on the periphery of the system centers we managed to grow and gather . we are all aware broadly speaking of the same phenomena and trends we have witnessed the breakup of families and harmonious relationships between men and women we have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism minority groups aggressive identitarianism and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness we have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas importing thirdworld immigration then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other lowwage individuals for a small place under the sun . we saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems we witnessed societies crumble conflictual minoritarian group identities being crafted by the likes of soros and the meritorious worker or professionalwhatever his racegetting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites we saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation  . of course some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the west once was . and here is the major fault line the leftists deny or value they often go from the former to the latterthe replacement of native european population the aggressive and tribalistic stance of minority groups towards the silent majority the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and males either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of for example when they say that whites are not under replacement or they demonize it as a remnant of some privilege or prejudice . all their talk about oppressed minorities dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority of nonwhite meritorious and integrated westerners and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy to dignity or to even basically survive in a world of our own they work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision . the importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the internet a lot of us were closet nationalists years ago and still are we could not and often still cannot be nationalists in public or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream you know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it . in the mid i found out about the information website fdesouche native french quote by the standards of today this news aggregator seems hardly interesting it mostly collates pieces written by others but then it was fantastic here i could recognize what i already felt about the worldthat something was wrong with all these nonwhites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it it was all concentrated before my eyes and others were talking about what they went through daily as well at least others felt and saw the same as i did i was not crazy not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left we were assembling and we were on the internet fdesouchecomthe website they want to keep you from visiting . as most of us found ourselves under attack from nonnative frenchmen and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture we often despised immigration in general but eventually things changed thanks to alain soral  mostly who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook mathias cardet a black journalist who worked with soral showed how gangstarap culture was injected and nurtured among nonwhites by powerful interests . after all one can be black or arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category . being prowhite promasculinity and protradition does not require being white i often felt closer from muslims with good intentions ie muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using islam as a mask for antiwhite tribalism than from white liberals the muslims would not share my blood but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for tradition two things that white liberals eagerly reject faith front warriors alliance against common foes . the internet is immaterial it is basically a network where information flows awareness and the will to spread it are immaterial as well this is why we could meet and act on the internet after all the alt right and manosphere have been sharing ideas media contents memes advisesand only later proceeded to meetups panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process . ENTITYNAME7s victory is a major one regardless of what the ENTITYNAME154 will actually do it is an event of considerable historical magnitude but it is only the beginningmake no mistake about that the libtards establishment still holds loads of money of institutions of cultural territory it has started to crumble and leak  yet it is still there . major battles are waiting ahead we have to further our awareness make thorough research on every aspect of leftism and develop more proper cultural references . always remember the libtards never cared one second about us they would have let us die off alone poor childless traumatized and demonized had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill . america is a firsttier power but it is still a battlefield among others wherever we are it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely it is a battle not between nationals and foreigners but between workers and parasites between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill media bullshit complacency parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing . we are the future it doesnt matter where we are we are those with true awareness those with genuine and healthy values those who struggled to hone their abilities and most importantly those who actually deserve to inherit the western world so save it and conquer it country after country institution after institution outlet after outletor there will be nothing left"}
{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice. but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women.  they take every opportunity . guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances. game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time. so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game.  they notice and follow up on iois . while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything. while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her. the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten. well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected. remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table.  they stand out from the crowd . every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality. while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession. i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in. your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group.  they are dominant . there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity. the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her. now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet.  they dont apologize . highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often. now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for. remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look. want to find out how to approach and seduce sexy girls buy my bestselling book the seven laws of seduction  for daily game advice connect with me on twitter troylaws . read more why

state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park ENTITYNAME28 went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in  but not so much for ENTITYNAME64 in  the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for ENTITYNAME64 . i previously quoted ENTITYNAME388 who had said that if ENTITYNAME64 clinton were running in november against ENTITYNAME379 the lizard would have his vote we have seen the ENTITYNAME64 koolaid drinkers go crazy after ENTITYNAME154 won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against ENTITYNAME64s pay for pay corruption . i have seen a lot of domestic antiENTITYNAME7 propaganda from the far right because ENTITYNAME154 is a zionist i agree with ENTITYNAME154 that we should stop funding isis and let ENTITYNAME389 take them down it was ENTITYNAME28 who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with ENTITYNAME154s intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism . but fortunately for iran what ENTITYNAME7 and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states . i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that ENTITYNAME6 is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf ENTITYNAME387 to the chancellorship in  . it is silly to think that the ENTITYNAME391s and the rothschilds backed ENTITYNAME7 . i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given ENTITYNAME154 a green light to dish out dirt on ENTITYNAME64 these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought ENTITYNAME64 was one witch too far to go . i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning ENTITYNAME387 and making him president and commander in chief far worse . the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the  families and their  minions that is according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass . fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist . i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david ENTITYNAME391 in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david ENTITYNAME391 in north america you never read that in our corporate media . please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the  presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here  these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of ENTITYNAME6 is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues . catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole  trillion from us i think they stole a lot more . the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in  when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in  it became law in  just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i . the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in  the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the  families that sent them . we are now in a far worse condition than if ENTITYNAME387s clone were to become president on january   . the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning . the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing . if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest . the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse . a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment . i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years . so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat . in short a race war to end all wars . of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning . the day of reckoning has arrived . the  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long . the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country . and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation . only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse"}

ENTITYNAME21s coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into ENTITYNAME21s emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that ENTITYNAME21 altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life . i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  . whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both . if ENTITYNAME21 is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life . i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in ENTITYNAME128s emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through . as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of ENTITYNAME21 s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee . metadata found on the laptop used by former rep ENTITYNAME240 and his estranged wife ENTITYNAME128 ENTITYNAME400 ENTITYNAME25 aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs ENTITYNAME25 used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs ENTITYNAME25 at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the ENTITYNAME25 email probe . of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation . at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  . government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not . either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said . but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by ENTITYNAME240 and ENTITYNAME128 and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi . many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the ENTITYNAME25s entitled  guilty as sin  . the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source ENTITYNAME400 friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week . some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist . according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice . he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom . so what happens next . in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge ENTITYNAME21 before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the ENTITYNAME25 campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump . however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against ENTITYNAME25 are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day . in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see ENTITYNAME21 forced out of the race before november th . once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible . if ENTITYNAME25 was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be . in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past . this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure . the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead . it sure seems ironic that ENTITYNAME240 is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale . courtesy of ENTITYNAME397"}

british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids . . the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting . . assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications . . vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others . . the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be . . by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient . . pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "return of kings has a great variety of information about many subjects improving your social life  health and fitness  tourism  among several others still our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with you might do well to take a closer look not all of us agree on everything but we do have a rough consensus on some items. our views on the political establishment the left blames corporations while the right blames the government when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people. its pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective especially on social matters not all of us started out that way many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society others have been turned off by political correctness once upon a time i used to be liberal and i know im not the only one be that as it may some of us are actually friendly to liberalism . by the way we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace really its not a democrat problem or republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin heads they win tails you lose. surely youre in favor of progress one good question though is what exactly this constitutes  also who gets to define what is progress all that might seem rhetorical but these are important matters likely you see change as a good thing but whos setting the agenda deciding which direction that change goes actually we have answers for all that. in fact we might have some more in common with you than you expect dont care for agribusiness neither do we  are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process we are too  do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the republicans and the democrats if you supported ENTITYNAME75 youve probably figured that one out already we understand you. todays political and social scene . you might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the democratic party today perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public  are you troubled by some of the ENTITYNAME25 scandals maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected . perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism  it once stood for helping the working man but some time in the s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness actually theres a reason for that  the culture war began long before the s that wasnt about liberation but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society. also taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs but why dont they solve problems instead they create intergenerational poverty you might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency along with taxing and spending to oblivion was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system  thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless. you might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter sure youre against police brutality as am i but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police  the authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble doesnt it. finally you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people we think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power. likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today why are women both liberated and spoiled  and sometimes even hostile cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad  sure youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits  you might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles especially if you have children in school. you consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society but you have doubts about journalistic integrity  hey we understand the propaganda is everywhere even in shows for young children  the media has been feeding you bullshit all your life and we think their lying is rotten you deserve better than that. starting to reconsider . a diehard social justice warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts even if youre a moderate you might be reluctant to consider any of this we understand rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process for so many things youll see that what youve been told is right is actually wrong and what is wrong is really right. many on the left have been there before and found their way out for me someone explained that im not responsible for the worlds problems its not your fault the endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve others whove made the journey have different stories some got religion others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others  some wondered why decades of costly social programs havent accomplished anything some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but fairness. its in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind still you dont have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite some have reached a synthesis position . welcome to the other side . if youve read this far with an open mindand checked out some of the referenced articlesthen you might be confused perhaps youre tempted to reject our message on the other hand you might be shocked and even angry about whats been going on in politics and society. we understand enlightenment is a painful process were here for you the truth hurts but well do the best we can to tell it like it is which is much more than can be said for what youll see on television ive merely scratched the surface here stick with us and youll see how deep the rabbit hole goes. read more the

child rape criminal justice researcher ENTITYNAME463 writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape ENTITYNAME461 its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole  our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july    two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online uk july   needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape ENTITYNAME461 of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of ENTITYNAME64s foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes

{"label": "bs", "text": " reasons why youre not happy  reasons why youre not happy . ENTITYNAME473 is an aspiring iconoclast he believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature . learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter  november   mind . happiness its what we all want as human beings no matter the differences in where we seek them we are motivated to do things to be happy and we avoid things that may detract from it even those who claim that they dont care about happiness or that theyre living for a higher purpose is doing what they do because it makes them happy in that way happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being . now although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being and as its often the case with selfimprovement i believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives . here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness  you are chasing it ill be happy once i finally . the more you chase happiness the less you have of it and not only are people today chasing happiness theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy money women and status may elevate your life but they cant be the source of happiness alone they will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill . also know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you so rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain focus on things that matter to you its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings  you dont have the basics taken care of good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society it affects your mood testosterone level mental capacity and more prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out . its often the basics that are overlooked ask yourself are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think are you eating healthy are you keeping yourself fit are you getting enough sunlight do you ever take the time to connect with nature do you have a stable life do you have a purpose or a meaning i doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off but im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being  you concern yourself with things you cant control no something bad is happening in the world and i cant do jack shit about it time to complain about it on the internet . the more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be of course being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience one thing im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world but i refuse to be emotionally invested in things i have no control over  you lack intimacy and deep human connection if you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with you didnt have any to begin with . i would argue that this is one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety depression and general unhappiness in the modern world humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others and beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink deeper connection needs to be made with people the quality matters much more than the quantity . in todays societyespecially in north americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling  you are not living in the present reality you may be conscious but are you aware . if you live in the past or the future you lose touch with the present reality that disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy . the lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is when your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself sort of like how mirages work on the contrary studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring so stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking  you engage in junk activities im happy im happy im happy . just as there are junk foods there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun . ask yourself do you really need entertainment ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day i barely even noticed that i was unhappy the whole time because i was so sedated and what did i even get out of them those were several hours everyday that i could have spent reading working out learning new skills meeting new people and experiencing the world . the fact is giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness sure you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone but overall as long as you find more valuable things to do your life can only get better when you ditch them learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value conclusion . unlike what many people today say no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all so while i havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards i hope i laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey nov   ENTITYNAME473 savage"}

ENTITYNAME475 ENTITYNAME224s ties to the ENTITYNAME25s go back to  when thenpresident bill ENTITYNAME25 appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president ENTITYNAME8  heres her official bio  . in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general ENTITYNAME229  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the ENTITYNAME477irs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill ENTITYNAME25 . it all started to publicly go downhill for ENTITYNAME224 during the first investigation into ENTITYNAME21s carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director ENTITYNAME122 was to meet with ENTITYNAME21 to interrogate her about the subject ENTITYNAME224 was busted having a secret meeting with bill ENTITYNAME25  the washington post reported . ENTITYNAME25s private unplanned meeting with attorney general ENTITYNAME475 e ENTITYNAME224 at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of ENTITYNAME21s use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation . ENTITYNAME224 has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer ENTITYNAME478 at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said . ENTITYNAME224 said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b ENTITYNAME123 bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public . of course it was all much easier for ENTITYNAME224 to abide by the decision when ENTITYNAME123 miraculously found that ENTITYNAME21 was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets . now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general ENTITYNAME224 and former president bill ENTITYNAME25  . on june   attorney general ENTITYNAME475 ENTITYNAME224 is reported to have met privately with former president bill ENTITYNAME25 on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs ENTITYNAME25s email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs ENTITYNAME25 and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting . republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill ENTITYNAME25 may have offered to extend ENTITYNAME224s position in the ags office during a ENTITYNAME21 administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment . last week ag ENTITYNAME224 blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported . attorney general ENTITYNAME475 ENTITYNAME224 is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that ENTITYNAME224 has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  . it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue . as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison . how very judicial of her ENTITYNAME224 tried to shut ENTITYNAME123 up about the new investigation into the ENTITYNAME25 emails . now even the mainstream media cant turn its head . earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director ENTITYNAME122 made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the ENTITYNAME21 emails but lets talk a little further about ENTITYNAME224s desperate attempts to shut him up . the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged ENTITYNAME123 against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b ENTITYNAME123 sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed ENTITYNAME21 email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections . how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with ENTITYNAME123s decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno . poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the ENTITYNAME25s she was also sworn in as ag under bill ENTITYNAME25 and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  . she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill ENTITYNAME25 never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated . she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom . the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements . the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat . every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to ENTITYNAME25whitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc ENTITYNAME25 cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her . but no such attorney general could have survived the ENTITYNAME25 scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact . attorney generals who have anything to do with the ENTITYNAME25s dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in ENTITYNAME25 scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out ENTITYNAME224 can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads . the last time ENTITYNAME224 was involved in the ENTITYNAME25 email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director ENTITYNAME122s recommendation  . i wonder if shell make that same promise this time . she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the ENTITYNAME25s the last time around and also this time when she decried ENTITYNAME123s release of information about the investigation . i wonder if she and ENTITYNAME21 will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out . courtesy of ENTITYNAME474 dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and

victim was mexican . that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team . similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one . when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of ENTITYNAME64s foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men . conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam . sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape .  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam .  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment . perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good . manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher . our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe . thats ENTITYNAME64s dream if she wins joe sobrans parody of the typical new york times headline about anything

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": " more emotions men should master  more emotions men should master . andrÃ© is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   mind . passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit start digging there and you will find new ones or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content socalled enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passionssomething that had been done at greater length actually by ENTITYNAME514ascould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life . whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense this is not only about emotional restraint or seduction our own emotional states are the first in line but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling how they can be led to a specific course of action and what tends to make them tick mastering the passions is far from evident it rather takes times and experience the concepts and directions i am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy . artists though they often suffer from mental problems are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state this is something the elite know very well critics trashed ayn ENTITYNAME516s atlas shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passiveaggressive cultural parasites ENTITYNAME516s novel was more cogent and attracted more heat than her barely original philosophical pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the secondhand book market . more recently the movie the fall  got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted ENTITYNAME387 as too human while seeing actor ENTITYNAME517 pondering eating talking to his closest company or getting angry the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him which is of course unacceptable to a left that clings to the idea of a crazy careless inhuman dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery . we need artists as well as qualified cultural critics to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way  gratitude . gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition being graceful means recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control neel ENTITYNAME518 heaven and hell  chap p it focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts . the traditional world whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into always emphasized the necessity of being grateful you owed your existence to god to your family and your community none of these goods were actually deserved which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children a lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has . moving later in time it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset the ideology of rights make many goods granted not a thank you for but an i have a right to neophilia the relentless pursuit of novelty always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time as if what was coming later was always better . advertisement gossip culture economic growth pressure quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has regardless of what it is by leading us to always want more progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual meritand when it flatters the ego it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful . turning our backs from the modern ungraceful mindset is easier said than done to start with loudmouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice luxurious workplaces to the men who built them lgbtbbq should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives antiwhite black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology feel free to expand the list ultimately i think every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something  trust . a famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism this absolutely makes sense some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence and some minority groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo communities have been fragmented by individualism ie each person looking to take as much as she can and by an antiracist white guilt that soon became an intrawhite generalized suspicion of racism people do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller communitywhich makes everyone else a potential enemy . yet without trust life becomes unbearable if you cant go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by say blm activists  or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation  there arent a lot of things you can do on the long run without trust in other people you have to trust the complex of big corporations ngo and state institutions we call the systemand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter . only trust in each other can make life sustainable and longterm projects workable to recreate trust we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones actions must bear consequences but before neomasculinity gets into power men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability persistence and a strong mindset i could wager you have been more trusting of your facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media  the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter  desire . modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire want cheaper prices more goods better goods more tv channels to watch more monies more ego and thinking you are the hot shit well just buy in x or do some work for y and here it is um nah you just have to do some more and some more and some more in the end you forgot why exactly you are doing what youre doing or why you started to watch tv but it all started with you led to perform something no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was . the system plays on desires in three ways it sets things to be desired things to be feared or never desired at all and things to be consummated without end things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire like a revolving credit a new sofa an suv or whatever as well as the next step of  progress  as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid . things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat bitching and sjwpropaganda spouting too bad thats globalization resistance is futile move on at last things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen . lately an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires decades before the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the progress the system needed him to work and monitor his peers today the junk is already everywhere pc culture is already hegemonic and the average american worker is no longer needed active desire is not needed anymore . thus the system has shifted into making the average joe more passive instead of actually desiring more the consumer should be content with surrogates of everythingpseudogroup identity with team sports pseudosports with football and basket on tv pseudosex with porn pseudolife with video games pseudofamily life with animals pseudoexpertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything this is brzezinskis tittytainment in a nutshell . even if you dont give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself thus retreating into individualism instead of trying to actually weight on the world either you surrender to the progress or you try to ignore it before it comes for you as if nothing could change . dont let the elite frame the world according to its own interests desire selfrealization and weighting on the course of the world of course our female counterparts should desire being loving caretaking and definitely on our side to conclude this series . once again it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions what i have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back if you find the topic worthy of interest you can expand it in two directions first documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion and second using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind . in the former case i would recommend neel ENTITYNAME518s heaven and hell quoted several times in the course of this series as a point of departure in the latter being creative or simply assertive is up to you whether this looks more like efforts or selfpersuasion or artistry does not matter much . here as well as in seduction a tight framing is key whatever the topic no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these the mastery of emotions is reinforcedand reinforcesthe mastery of representations if this sounds farfetched let me provide some examples of use examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you . in the comments space several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy he would be a fake a sneaky bastard a jerk so guys who want to get laid or have their own interests just as everyone else are jerks this looks like internalized feminist thinking in my opinion nice guys should elicit empathy which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture . a recent rok piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and delegimitate white victimhood they paint vividly any crime where the victim is nonwhite and the perpetrator is but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by nonwhites on whites . the same pattern appears in the movie elysium  when the of course white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher whereas the brownskinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty . analyzing these phenomena is fine but ultimately insufficient creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions picking up girls is part of and gives some experience in this wider game"}

to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or

demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing. . once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind. the key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable. keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man. when you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid. of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference. two examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again. . another example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored. relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us. . repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken. strained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake. read more   proven ways to stop obsessive thoughts"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "why ENTITYNAME6 must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money by   th  . if ENTITYNAME6 truly wants to fix the economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger  . americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as  the fourth branch of government  but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people . ENTITYNAME6 can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks . to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill . as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top . in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible . so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency . according to article i section  of the us constitution  it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures . so how did the fed get involved . well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c ENTITYNAME560 entitled  the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve  basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in  that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands . sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article  i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system . when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars . rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve . the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds . the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder  but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money . the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system . but wait . there is a problem . because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created . so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt . well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt . but that never actually happens does it . and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game . so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than  trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the  trillion dollar mark  . but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us . many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do  . if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have   of household debt   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well . under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt . and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank . even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption . as you read this article well over  of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank . do you think that is just a coincidence . of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea . and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea . but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank  . we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts . since the federal reserve was created in  there have been  distinct recessions or depressions                    . considering their track record isnt it time for a change . and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes . back in  president john f kennedy issued executive order  which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government . he was assassinated shortly thereafter . most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today  and president trump could do something similar . but will he . it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves . debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit   of  trillion dollars  and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become .   here in the united states that starts with shutting   issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task"}

hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade not immigration as if the words open borders were never mentioned but the email exchange also shows how ENTITYNAME64s aboutface on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to ENTITYNAME75 voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals in a speech at goldmanblack rock on feb   carrk pointed out ENTITYNAME25 admitted shes kind of far removed from middleclass struggles due to the economic you know

{"label": "hate", "text": "home this month popular why its absolutely worth it to learn game why its absolutely worth it to learn game . jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on  strategies to develop your masculinity november   game . after my previous article  which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were . this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore . in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite . as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is  worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist . i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning  and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed . most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women  how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird . of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous . you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s . this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing . this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so . this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point . once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent  and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point . the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral . if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls . when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly  who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks . the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models . let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile . due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without . as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior . this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral . once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun . this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship . this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women . then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits  because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do game is worth it it just sucks at first getting over beginners hell is a lot like this once you get to the other side its all downhill though . as i have made clear learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from . i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and can feel like it isnt worth it but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it your world will literally be x better than before if youre struggling with learning game initially be sure to maximize your appearance . get some height increasing soles read through some of the style articles on rok get a good designer haircut and learn to perfect your appearance at least as much as you can consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence as well . ultimately however if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up you just have to bite the bullet and go out go clubbing go to bars go on trips to las vegas or miami approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this beginners hell and will experience an abundance of women in your life"}

what they are going to get there is always optimism when a new president is elected but i dont know if i have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many ENTITYNAME7 supporters are expressing right now look i voted for ENTITYNAME6 and i want him to be as successful as possible but when ENTITYNAME6 becomes our next president on january th  that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear if you listen to some people they make it sound like america is going to experience nothing but peace prosperity and blessing for decades to come i would love it if that was indeed going to be the case but unfortunately that is simply not the truth . we are currently on a path that leads to national suicide and unless we change our ways it isnt going to matter who is in the white house . i keep hearing about how our new president is going to unify the nation but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever in fact a brand new gallup survey found that an alltime record high  percent of all americans believe that we are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values  . i keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and prosperity but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion mills . i keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a rocket but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history  the only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history today we have accumulated  trillion dollars in consumer debt corporate debt has doubled since the last financial crisis and the national debt is rapidly approaching  trillion dollars how can ENTITYNAME7 possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than ENTITYNAME28 has already done . i keep hearing about how we are going to make america great again but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world combined . i keep hearing about how law and order is going to restored but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn inauguration day into a major riot  . i keep hearing about how things are going to go back to the way they used to be but as i discussed in a previous article  sexuallytransmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than  times higher than in  and approximately two out of every three christian men watch pornography on a regular basis . i keep hearing about how we are going to drain the swamp and yet there are no plans to even reform the federal reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation  . i keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the supreme court but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is fine with the supreme court decision that forced all  states to redefine the institution of marriage . i keep hearing about how we are going to be an example for the rest of the world but how can we be an example when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own country . i keep hearing about how our government is going to be blessed but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to planned parenthood be blessed now that the republicans have control of the white house the senate and the house of representatives this is their golden opportunity to defund planned parenthood if it doesnt happen now it probably will never happen and it will show what a complete and utter failure the republican party has become remember planned parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder . some would argue that america is already great at a lot of things after all the united states is number one in the world in television watching legal drug use and illegal drug use . we lead the world in plastic surgery eating disorder deaths teen pregnancy and lawyers per capita . we have the highest std infection rate in the industrialized world the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world and the largest prison population on the entire planet . we also have the most complicated tax system in the entire world the largest trade deficit in the entire world and the largest national debt in the entire world . so if we want to make america great again we sure have a lot of work to do . the complacency that i am seeing out there right now really alarms me so many people seem to think that the battle is won because ENTITYNAME6 was victorious on election night but that is not even close to reality . if we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive tinkering with tax rates regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done so many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and scratches when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery . ENTITYNAME6 is not some sort of a messiah and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough . but for the moment millions of americans are proclaiming peace and safety now that ENTITYNAME6 has won the election and we shall see how it all turns out november st   tags americans  anxiety  blessing  ENTITYNAME6  national suicide  peace  safety  successful  suicide  ENTITYNAME7  category commentary we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash"}
