{"label": "hate", "text": "are the polls rigged against trump all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct michael on television half of the population of the world is dirt poor  and the global elite want to keep it that way   nd  . could you survive on just  a day according to compassion international  approximately half of the population of the entire planet currently lives on  a day or less meanwhile those hoarding wealth at the very top of the global pyramid are rapidly becoming a lot wealthier dont get me wrong  i am a very big believer in working hard and contributing something of value to society and those that work the hardest and contribute the most should be able to reap the rewards in this article i am in no way shape or form criticizing true capitalism because if true capitalism were actually being practiced all over the planet we would have far far less poverty today instead our planet is dominated by a heavily socialized debtbased central banking system that systematically transfers wealth from hard working ordinary citizens to the global elite those at the very top of the pyramid know that they are impoverishing everyone else and they very much intend to keep it that way . lets start with some of the hard numbers according to zero hedge  credit suisse had just released their yearly report on global wealth and it shows that  percent of all the wealth in the world is controlled by just  percent of the people . as credit suisse tantalizingly shows year after year the number of people who control just shy of a majority of global net worth or  of the roughly  trillion in household wealth is declining progressively relative to the total population of the world and in  the number of people who are worth more than  million was just  million roughly  of the worlds population of adults on the other end of the pyramid some  billion adults had a net worth of less than  accounting for just about  trillion in household wealth . and since this is a yearly report we can go back and see how things have changed over time when zero hedge did this it was discovered that the wealth of those at the very top has nearly doubled over the past six years and meanwhile the poor have gotten even poorer . incidentally we tracked down the first credit suisse report we found in this series from   where the total wealth of the top layer in the pyramid was a modest  trillion for the worlds millionaires it has nearly doubled in the  years since then meanwhile the worlds poorest have gotten you got it poorer as those adults who were worth less than  in  had a combined net worth of  trillion a number which has since declined to  trillion in  despite a half a billion increase in the sample size . if these trends continue at this pace it wont be too long before the global elite have virtually all of the wealth and the rest of us have virtually nothing . perhaps you are fortunate enough to still have a good job and you live in a large home and you will sleep in a warm bed tonight . well you should consider yourself to be very blessed because that is definitely not the case for most of the rest of the world the following  facts about global poverty come from dosomethingcom  and i want you to really let these numbers sink in for a moment nearly  of the worlds population  more than  billion people  live on less than  a day more than  billion live in extreme poverty  less than  a day  billion children worldwide are living in poverty according to unicef  children die each day due to poverty  million people worldwide do not have enough food to eat  food banks are especially important in providing food for people that cant afford it themselves run a food drive outside your local grocery store so people in your community have enough to eat sign up for supermarket stakeout  more than  million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water  diarrhea caused by inadequate drinking water sanitation and hand hygiene kills an estimated  people every year globally or approximately  people per day in   million children under the age  were stunted reduced rate of growth and development due to chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of  million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment as of   million children under  year of age worldwide had not received the three recommended doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis  of all humans live without electricity  approximately  billion people  of the world population lives on less than  a day  oxfam estimates that it would take  billion annually to end extreme global povertythats less than  the income of the top  richest billionaires the world food programme says the poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty hunger is the number one cause of death in the world killing more than hivaids malaria and tuberculosis combined . so how did we get here . debt is the primary mechanism that takes wealth from ordinary people like you and me and puts it into the hands of the global elite . in my recent article entitled  why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money  i discussed how the federal reserve was designed to entrap the us government in an endless debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape and that is precisely what has happened as the us national debt has gotten more than  times larger since the federal reserve was created in  . in that very same year the federal income tax was instituted and that is a key part of the program for the global elite you see the income tax is how wealth is transferred from us to the government and then a continuously growing national debt is how that wealth is transferred from the government to the elite . it is a very complicated system but at the end of the day it is all about taking money from us and getting it into their pockets . and at this point more than  percent of the population of the world lives in a country with a central bank and almost every nation on the planet has some form of income tax . it is a global system that is designed to create as much debt as possible and i recently shared with my readers that the total amount of debt in the world has hit a staggering   of  trillion dollars  . interestingly the bible actually foretells of a time when rich men would hoard wealth in the last days the following are the first five verses of the book of james in the modern english version  . come now you rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten  your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have stored up treasures for the last days  indeed the wages that you kept back by fraud from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying and the cries of those who harvested have entered into the ears of the lord of hosts  you have lived in pleasure on the earth and have been wayward you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter . so much of the time we focus on the other great sins that we see all around us but the truth is that one of the greatest sins of all in our world today is the sin of greed . the borrower is the servant of the lender and the global elite have used various forms of debt to turn the rest of the planet into their debt slaves . as debt levels race higher and higher all over the planet the elite are using the magic of compound interest to grab a bigger and bigger share of the pie . given enough time those at the very top would have virtually everything and the rest of us would have virtually nothing the middle class is shrinking all over the globe and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to grow at an astounding pace . but the vast majority of people out there have no idea how money debt taxes and central banks really work and so they have no idea that this is purposely being done to them . so please share this article with as many people as you can the truth is that we dont have to have this much global poverty and if we correctly identify the root causes of this poverty we can start working on some real solutions"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "the war against payday lending apple uses similar tactics with iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  . in june of  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry . the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations . the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative . instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water . in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation . the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product . for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone  is said to cost  to produce and is sold for  dollars that is  times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of  percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers . so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers . studies show these lenders charge on average  percent or  for every  loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets . the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments . the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow . simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency . the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies . remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans . lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments . at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans . in fact more than  percent of the  submissions to the bureaus  tell your story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans . these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it . this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back . policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false . the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for . jonathan lee is a filmmaker and freelance economics journalist

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   by  . cannon ball nd  on thursday police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry pepper spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with  nothing . under orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas . but the target of their operation  a group of slightly more than  native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline  never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors . reports vary but no less than  people were arrested thursday and  according to witnesses  police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels  without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo . it goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator  who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times  . although thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out  solely because of gratuitous police aggression . after facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of  camp  in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest  had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising  . today the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming  treaty rights this is unceded land highway  as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful . despite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected  horribly awry . a prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested . claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience . no matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize  disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come . in fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters  for reasons as yet unknown . during the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman  for doing her job filming events as they happened  though charges were subsequently thrown out . although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that  because the guards lacked proper licensing  they could now face criminal charges on wednesday the morton county sheriffs office made the determination that dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota . bob frost owner of ohiobased frost kennels told the guardian  all the proper protocols  were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters . frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident  but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian  police have only managed to identify two people . the sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work  however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control . in a statement cited by the guardian  morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been

{"label": "hate", "text": "after this october surprise  only has one option left expose the    on television democrats are now calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by  snyder on november th  . the surprise victory by  on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning  in effigy there have even been shootings at anti rallies in seattle and in portland  hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening  on twitter  and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this . even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter  has ominously warned that  the revolution is coming  and comedian  has boldly declared that   gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets  . of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose  there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a  presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach  once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary  are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful . but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only  percent of all   s victory to be legitimate a protest near  tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately  people and usa today reported that the anti protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly  devolved into a riot  . it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution  . no sooner had  been declared the  th president of the united states funded political operations launched their activities to disrupt   s lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by  one in  and the other ten years later in  . as the s were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the funded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some  other cities across the united states . so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america . is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a  presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation . well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo  . clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics . we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa  our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed . and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news  . the election of  has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker  moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately  .  must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists  prepare to impeach  just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law  and then we must remove him from office  must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all  supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable . but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty . this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post  college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing ?the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten ?the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available ?cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate ?tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten  more like summer camp ?at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams  either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach . and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation . we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent . many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that  could bring america together and lead us into a new era of peace and prosperity but the radical left already hates  more than any president that has ever come before him . it isnt going to take much to push the radical left over the edge and if that happens we could see endless chaos violence and civil unrest for the next four years"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "in a previous article  i discussed stretchingnamely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch. i am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use. how not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all. the muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving. even when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning. however if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is. . relax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques. the most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to  for naming the concept. to use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and thensit and wait. . yes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive. this is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion. as you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop. this technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the relax into stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation. or you can try forced relaxation where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax. . either way you slice it dont just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results. read more why stretching is essential for the body with  beginner stretches to get you started"}

christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series . the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes .  to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians .  to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia . accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof . because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it . previous reports"}

their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the   god has commanded is  we must institute with the law. modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore ever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law.  described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary. the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom

book on game in  his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs. he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy. he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike

cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are. antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men. anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity. antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates. antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews. anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   by  . picture if you will video footage of vintage early   buffoonery with the ceo of cbs  commenting on major medias choice to give  vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs . thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  . the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about . id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence . still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by s analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition . one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today . but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war . and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin . stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other . stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government . the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers . stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it . stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored . missing from the film and website of all governments lie is if stones work on lies about the outbreak of the korean war weve learned more since he wrote it but seen little more insightful relevant or timely for our understanding of korea and the world today this entry was posted in general  bookmark the permalink"}

sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the  camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day . still i will be voting against hillary  on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of   and for the vice presidency of gov  . regrettably with many of my never  friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness . even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this  fiasco first those ian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never ers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong . and then there are the selfrighteous intheeye never  prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary s tyranny in perpetuity . the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary  stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never ers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  . mrs s beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother . during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder . he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull . her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage . this is homicide plain and simple hillary  supports it  opposes it . we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs  is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner . my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs  and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs  still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court . its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs  by voting for mr  this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate  and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations . with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil . history will reflect as much . under a president hillary  millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president  these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth . the devil

crash   november th  . since s victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in  years  global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since november th and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a  administration will mean much higher inflation and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of us history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect sense because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the  administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later . for those that are not familiar with the bond market when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go down that is bad news for economic growth . so we generally dont want yields to go up . unfortunately yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks and the yield on  year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since july  . the year treasury yield jumped to  in late trading on friday the highest since december  up  basis point since the election and up one full percentage point since july . the year yield is at a critical juncture in terms of reality the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in december after a year of flipflopping a slew of postelection pronouncements by fed heads  including  relatively soon  have pushed the odds of a rate hike to  . as i noted the other day  so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on us treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as  has noted  the average rate on  year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere . the carnage in bonds has consequences the average interest rate of the a conforming year fixed mortgage as of friday was quoted at  for top credit scores thats up about  percentage point from just before the election according to mortgage news daily  it put the month on a short list of  worst months in more than a decade . if mortgage rates continue to shoot higher there will be another housing crash . rates on auto loans credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down . why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from steve bannon  . in a nascent administration that seems at best random in its beliefs bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice but almost a messianic one . like andrew jacksons populism were going to build an entirely new political movement he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship yards iron works get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the s greater than the reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movement . steve bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new  administration and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress . and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add  trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year . sadly all of this comes at a time when the us economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in yearoveryear earnings for the sp  and industrial production has now contracted for  months in a row  . the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now and it isnt going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance roberts  . with an economy running at below  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak for the bulk of americans there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes . combine weak economics with higher interest rates which negatively impacts consumption and a stronger dollar which weighs on exports and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later . yes the stock market soared immediately following s election but it wasnt because economic conditions actually improved . if you look at history a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders . and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the  administration it is inevitable that stock prices will follow . the waning days of the  administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash . of course any problems that occur after january th  will be blamed on  but the truth is that  will be far more responsible for what happens than  will be . right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because  won the election . that is an enormous mistake . a shaking has already begun in the financial world and this shaking could easily become an avalanche . now is not a time to party rather it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead . all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly but without a doubt they are still on the way . so get prepared while you still can because time is running out"}

woman shot at toddler terrorized  august    comments . buffalo ny  in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals . police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs  mostly cannabis . after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way . on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a  lb  black male raided the home of   a   lb white male . while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor  pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail . police took aim at the helpless dog who according to  was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured s monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying . as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse .  lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs . what just happened  recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable . as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in s floor and out of the hole of  ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too . after they nearly killed her cops raided  home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown . neither  nor  were charged with a crime . the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of  and  . according to meers lawyer matthew albert  meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as boots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull . meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops . just like  meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail . as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death . my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said . also like  meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police . according to meers attorney he has  active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad . they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times  found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong . in  the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking . according to use of force reports buffalo police shot  dogs from jan   through sept  seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived . to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size . the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in  certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog . apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs . when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques . apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide . something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report  percent of swat raids are searches for drugs . if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war  the two are not mutually exclusive  is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence

address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics . noknock search warrants this is the real crime . the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant . the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation . no hostage no raid common sense . so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike . i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock . they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them  we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor  terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm  incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all  they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro . tried to twitter you a link

us i was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called galtons problem an observational dynamic named after its discoverer sir . to state it very crudely galtons problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete when in fact they are not for example those who failed to predict s electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the united states were isolated from those of the rest of the world such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries most notably england italy france and hungary. sir . failure to take into consideration the big picture is still forgivable of course no one can be right all the time or even most of the time systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data rather than too little but deliberate lying is quite another matter and it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues rather than act as a check on governmental power the media has actually become an arm of government power enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective. . individual journalists can play significant roles in this process consider a favorite example of mine the case of famed baseball player  ive been an admirer of  for a very long time ever since reading his autobiography as a boy something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him the worst of these was sports writer  whose biography of  has now been discredited as mostly fabrication.  was granted exclusive access to  in  and  for his biographical purposes  shared with him many intimate details of his life and career but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections  embellished slanted and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast  in the worst possible light    as a southern racist  was from georgia a misogynist and even a murderer  was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself. to add insult to injury s writings were used as the basis for a terrible  film called   tommy lee jones the film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved toand didflop at the box office the real  was a complex driven and highly intelligent figure who knew how to court controversy when he had to but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by charles leerhsen entitled  a terrible beauty . a famous photo of  stealing third base. to begin with  used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents he made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses for example when he learned that pitcher walter johnson hated hitting batters with pitches  would crowd the plate to force johnson to walk him he learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries forcing them to lose their tempers when they did  would steal bases right under their noses he remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base. . one legend about  that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler this is simply not true it is true that men of his era got into fistfights oftenit was part of a healthy masculine culture back thenbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone the few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior eg a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physicallyminded men like him became entangled with nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them including babe ruth. s character assassination of  went even further painting him as an unreconstructed southern racist who had a grudge against blacks this is completely false  was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues when asked his opinion about subject by the sporting news in  he said the negro has the right to compete in sports and who is to say he has not. he had nothing but compliments for black athletes like willie mays and jackie robinson and players in the negro league whom  interacted with in the s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in s makeup  mentored younger players corresponded with fans with personalized letters and helped found a hospital and a college education fund.  was certainly no angel but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now  himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity but he had a limit and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate. s lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding  will take decades to undo if anything  was too trusting in letting a man like  into his confidence  was so angry with s hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of s writings in  just before his death the terrible  film  only added more oil to the fire. malicious journalism can do serious damage sometimes the damage comes from ignorance other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood the motives for lyingwhether coming from money fame or the desire to virtue signalcan always be found if one digs below the surface in the modern era the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us. read more  an

{"label": "hate", "text": "more people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens is the way forward a problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power. imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink instead of nagging at him every evening which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again the husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out. right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members in other words globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap a device they transform into to their advantage as of right now the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right. elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic . the way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic  meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other create friction and from that comes a desired result ie order from chaos those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends. the recent rise in nationalism i speculate has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda soviet communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in syria and iran to proceed like  did with iraq and afghanistan in addition the white vs black race war is years late stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that  pours onto the fire a new dialectic must be nurtured and so nationalism may just do the trick s recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism as the new enemy. while your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true and im sure to agree with it you were guided onto those beliefs how did you arrive at nationalist thought through decades of free trade feminism and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of george soros who pulled out a million muslims from his hat and placed them in europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the united states his actions and behavior along with other powerful globalists like him have essentially created your very ideology because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other. the growth of nationalism is useful nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests and when it does the globalists will clamp down severely on it as if replaying world war  they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking and even poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets. . a hint that this may already be taking place is that france recently called upon patriots to serve in their national guard to protect citizens since when does france care about patriots they have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death i wouldnt be surprised if frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like poland which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly western europeans. as long as youre in the dialectic which i see as a sort of twilight zone creation of the mega rich youre fighting on their terms they need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate good and evil as if we were living in a hollywoodstyle storyline instead of this twodimensional arrangement the solution may be to go d where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick. just because a nationalist resistance is growing doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt without being able to effectively control the western population through the cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer or modern russian aggression they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward while im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs as i surely wont throw away mine it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung and we will all suffer when its finally launched. this article was originally published on roosh v  . dont miss patriarchal nationalism what is national identity"}

opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend  my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly  and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am  woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend  that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask   said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by recrisp because typo"}

of state just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring  has said hes now considering a move from the white house to venture capitalism that has silicon valley slathering at the opportunity. every four years americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs andor aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the paytoplay campaign contributions of the oligarchs. in municipal and county elections and ballot measures americans often do have real choices but the higher and more powerful the office the greater the corruption and oligarchic control nevertheless only a small minority of americans actually vote n local elections the atlantics citylab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than  vote in mayoral elections in  of the  most populous cites disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of american political life. regarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate  who said we say to  we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate  has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never. more top aide to   urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about s russia ties what will   do for india not much and heres why s policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a   presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance  is the american dream in all its glory. im not sure i can explain the  dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the  foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host. regarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the s certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the  foundation and the  global initiative were all wondering whether   and maybe even  might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of  email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife  aide huma abedin if   is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so   is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules  was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency  acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the  presidential library and  s new york senate campaign. according to the law president  had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption. in   polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the  foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules. when guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state   giustra then contributed  million to the  foundation and  was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now s trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the  foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances. meanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room   the s as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when  was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator   voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake. how do you explain that candidate  who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats. again  serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics. but theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald  defeating  became a liberal crusade. there are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite s overt racism he told me that he considers  even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that  for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that  is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad. our green party presidential candidate  is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity. dont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath. i wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however  has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to  who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the s have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist ionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one. its hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does. one possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr  wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money. five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that s campaign has been able to raise. winning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states. everyone knows that  is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing  in the oval office. she is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid  operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged. you are close to  head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged. well i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us. jills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good. of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent  and  from winning the  that would make us an official national party. i have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent  and  they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election. one of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers. is not   a danger for humanity. hell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia. and i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the s all but certain return to the white house the s are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known  would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority. you have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa. well im no expert in this but i can say a few things. first i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaorÃ© in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorÃ©s ouster by a popular movement. france and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there. however a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda. in  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppÃ© who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppÃ© seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppÃ© will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives. while africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power. the old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests. france the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that. in your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model. i really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa . why are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces. the competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests. i sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr lÃ©opold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other. libya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya. its horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read  s email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in   email we came we saw we got oil .  says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north africa. interview realized by . who is .  is an independent

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "by catherine j frompovich . part  of  . the following is the testimony i will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live . this testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter . there are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc . personally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     . your honor judge    members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties . since today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume . however in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  . since the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state . smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters . those five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health . point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty . frompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers . again frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  . frompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce . however harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege . all men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  . however contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process . the above five researchers exhibit a delineate cell phone and smart meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum see paragraph  of their letter to the ncuc for more detail including that smart meters over a hour period can average  pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity  . i submit into the record exhibit a dirty electricity or dirty power and the page report why are electromagnetic fields dangerous  is dirty electricity making you sick including  charts  table  ranking electric meters and table  ranking electric meters for risk of privacy and cyber security from the page report ranking electricity meters for risk to health privacy and cyber security available online at httpswwwscribdcomdocrankingelectricitymetersforrisktohealthprivacyandcybersecurity  . the key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation . that federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc . frompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  . on page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics . nonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion . paragraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising . frompovich feels comed to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures . your honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science . arent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence . frompovich also feels comed to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania . heres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters . analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog . three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter an existing

presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of  has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with  to instill deep popular fear of a  administration fear of  has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once  actually takes office. the corporate media has exploited the general populations distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process  has made heinous statement after heinous statement all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day however s vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of  his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a  presidency. one could endlessly debate  supporters on the validity of such a claim s vulgar and putrid presentation has provided  supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the  elections it is reasonable to assume that a  presidency will be far less effective than  in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support system the entire ruling class has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a russia collaborative threat in every sphere of us political life. here are ten things to expect from a  presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether  represents a lesser evil than  or just plain evil.  the privatization of social security   has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program wikileaks exposed s support for the s administrations deficit reduction commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and medicare in   donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit. more  must be indicted how  ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil r  policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world  world war iii   has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a nofly zone in syria that means us airstrikes would rain down on syrian and russian assets in syria such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the russia  has been caught stating that the syrian and russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits.  the transpacific partnership  often called nafta on steroids the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of asia pacific region has been a major talking point in the  elections  has supported the agreement in the past only to switch her position due to pressure from the bernie sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the  camp there is currently nothing in the way to stop  from moving forward with the tpps passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality.  maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state  not much needs to be said here the  administrations vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed snowden and julian assange wikileaks additionally revealed s desire to drone julian assange for releasing washingtons secrets to the public a  presidency has every intention of following up on the  administrations passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of  this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain terror suspects indefinitely.  s wall   was s secretary of state from  over this time she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history furthermore she oversaw the detention of thousands of central american children during the great migration from the  fascist coup in honduras a coup that was drawn up by  herself the usmexico border is more militarized than it has ever been s wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration policy.  servitude to the bankers   has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the  elections before selling out bernie sanders made it a point to request public access into s private quarter million dollar speeches to banks like goldman sachs the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the glasssteagall act was a  project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class.  maintenance of the mass black incarceration state   is the enemy of black america from her callous use of the term super predator to describe working class black men to being the architect of the  crime bill the  dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and s two terms the prison population rose by  this was facilitated by draconian three strikes laws mandatory drug sentence and the deep militarization of local police departments with her record it isnt too difficult to assume what another four years of  rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons.  austerity and more austerity  it was the first  administration that eliminated welfare as we know it the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children afdc and its replacement temporary assistance to needy families tanf threw millions of women and children into poverty  has followed up with draconian cuts to snap foodstamps there is nothing on s track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the us.  a boost to the privatization of education   received boos in july when she urged teachers unions and charter operators to work together for the greater good of students ever since  has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education but that hardly matters  receives broad support from school privatizers like walmart and should not be expected to roll back the shock and awe war on public education waged by the  administration.  an economic crisis  bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of  capitalists everywhere were given free rein to recover with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in  the internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates whether  can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well  has remains to be seen.  may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than donald  for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class the question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the twoparty corporate duopoly jill stein and ajamu baraka are attempting to build the base of the green party ticket whatever method is chosen it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a  administration"}

needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  .  hillary  . the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary  or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news  to her and  at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy . those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms s response to s question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic . while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress . womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result . let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that s overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary s stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to  citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press . s reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy  is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary  have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the s also have a long association . one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind s debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary  presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated s rise to power are fundamentally malignant . in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting  elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of s popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the  campaign the democratic national committee and the white house . the bottom line here is that hillary  represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates . the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government . media wishing to interview  please contact  receive s commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for s alerts you

competence as such we continue to question just how long y can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james y is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james y is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the  investigations y will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james y doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary   he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dcy in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from  if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if y gives hillary  a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james y if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary  and  if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary  and  should be behind bars   is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary  campaign implodes either before or on november th y needs to  out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary  had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall y would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary  is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence y could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the  machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to james ys home address along with notes that say something like youre next lets watch and see if he grows a

{"label": "hate", "text": "over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline. in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer. the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization. democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run. presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences. additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides. the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea . for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image. the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago. the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style. cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated. this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system. the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing. apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways. the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle. if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts. . whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society. lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact. this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller. due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that. women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim. additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same. as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations. . additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material. western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so. conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not. read more how to get laid in

into the dnc and moscow is not feeding  emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow . the white house and the  campaign are now married to the idea that  is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools . even vp  wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it . it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us . what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by s constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house  has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement . on july th  from the washington post wrote the  campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after  suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked s private email server it should release the emails the  campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and  in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans . anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media . you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir  made a mild passing remark about donald s gop primary success from that point on s political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another . never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president  got in on the act intensifying the  narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing  then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir    on oct th at a  rally in miami . backed by the  white house  and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive . hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state . but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty . the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r  monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week . and then down to almost nothing . it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county . at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack . are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election . behind s wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house . on october th the  administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including s campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks . soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir  believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend s calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response . according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it . image crowdstrike cyber security . the posts nakashima then added . the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers . an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement   we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities . moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense  dmitry peskov . despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona  last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented . likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually  definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house  and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  . still during the final presidential debate  proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it . the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence . we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election   i find that deeply disturbing . whats even more disturbing is the fact that  is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are s  agencies . air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence . what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about  emails answer nothing . the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda . in both instances the  administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both  administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  . under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the  team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the  campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything . to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if  directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks . for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it . in   claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures . this isnt the first time that president  has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december   claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  . jumping the shark . after their democratic party convention on july th the  campaign machine put all of its chips on their  narrative . soon after a cadre of top  national security surrogates then accused  of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused  is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and s refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb .  josh schwerin joshschwerin october   .  spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which  held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the  braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the  campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the  campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing . they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group  struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and  instead . either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the  campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization . their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in  sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and  supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened . to prove this point both president  and  then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful   not surprisingly  thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership   . the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it . party meltdown . wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to  .  a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper .  a march  email shows that she shared a question with  campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  . braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here .  completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot . in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the  campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage . clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with  and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq .  lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   . worse than watergate . perhaps a bigger scandal which the  white house and  campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the  foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into  issue . some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people  others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the  foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the  foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president . theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a  foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the  email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  . so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the  scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the  email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself . what wire reported on oct st is how president  lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server  told cbs news on march   that he only found out about s server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that .  used a pseudonym bameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state  by email and at least one of those emails ended up on s private email server . so not only did  lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with  on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it . sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill   just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people . on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers . coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  . it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the  justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case . on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the  email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top  aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports . oh yes recall our post from last week   campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after s benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik . oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill  internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms . fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to  aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks . to call the  circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it . russia  the party scapegoat . former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as  ironically comey put himself on the same side as  .  howard dean govhowarddean october   . another veteran party operative and lifetime  defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  . i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think  carville . maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  . these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the  campaign along with the many exposÃ©s revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks . suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald  in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised  over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that  is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald  who  and  claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir  the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the  campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  . the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki . with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about . the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like  and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack   we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that . whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind . that  its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that  and  are trying manipulate the  election . on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table . we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security . selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the  era . knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry . still

top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state. the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc. using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory. the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january. the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation. more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president  suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by  failed to resolve the issue. mr  is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister  the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting. israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war. condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts. the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region. writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries. at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel. israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians. the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since . under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory. israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated. the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy"}

irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with . during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented  from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar . canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stÃ©phane   aung san  is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating .    now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state .  the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which  fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall . in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian . another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate  by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been . in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations . myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting  attempted to distance what  and her political supporters had once  draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state . a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san  . he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law . hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township . around  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group  the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person . the article also admits . the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law . aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter . another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party . hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief . emg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming . eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year . one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off . the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where  and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of s breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as  and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations . the overt nature of both the wests and s hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like  and her ndl themselves . international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power .  bangkokbased geopolitical

boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the  crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off ions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the sthis racket must end the s and all their nspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the s are a thousand times larger and more

when i left breitbart back in march i accused  of turning breitbart news into  pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of  has put a stake through the heart of  legacy in my opinion  is a bully and has sold out  mission in order to back another bully  he has shaped the company into s personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter . that decision paid off for   in august he became s campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who  was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  . with s accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do . is  antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that s a racist or that hes an antisemite the  posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august  has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright   the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to  and their attempts to declare all  support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all  supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with  nor is it people angry at the media  knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence  believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer  along as he marbles s speeches with talk of globalism  and that  wont be pushing  to dump the racists and antisemites who support  anytime soon after all they love   actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean  will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests . what does s accession mean  has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and  he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power . so what will he do with that power hell target enemies  is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should  win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people . but more importantly s interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the  movement  .  is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare s platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like  but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should  win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had . thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that  reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and  met with farage shortly after being elected  has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name . which war will  lead  considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will s actual role be its difficult to tell since  announced the  hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that  will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario . others have speculated that  has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at  hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine . its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for  and s whispering in s ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for  this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate  is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to s agenda . if s leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda  opposes the republican party hates   minutes after the joint priebus announcement breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn  loves the firefight the only question is which direction

{"label": "bs", "text": "prof  responds to the vicechancellor of the university of punjab outlining the background of the  case at the  shares.    . dear vice chancellor kamran. salam from the east coast of canada. thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor  like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr s action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however h is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate. you have correctly identified h to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the  era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr  pathetically relies upon is a product of the  era  had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like h have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although  didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor  travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after  and the neocon came to power. this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of  travesty . more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the  regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old  who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience. the attack on professor  was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved hs planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing. clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr  has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim. had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim. so what happened to professor  is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor  people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal. the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  . yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists. in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states. to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible. the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice. thats how extremism works.  sincerely.

light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open

before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only

hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons . s ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church .  the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later  was fired . at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the

the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today . now in response to s lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts . this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said  senior counsel for first liberty . no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said  in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so . officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment . s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support . on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code . wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen . the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  . in a prepared statement wednesday on s case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us . welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to  is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons . first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon

largest public policy womens group with  members also came to s defense . penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr  is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs . can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share . wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed s sermons and then fired him . no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of s sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist . state officials also joked about informing  of his firing . the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up . pfirman said

embassy and that night the dns server pointed to a different ip address for wikileaks and google updated everything instantly so the transfer was completely seamless from the real wikileaks server to the fake wikileaks server that was at a completely different ip address . .  mr assanges subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters i reported this repeatedly . .  mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden for example mcfadyen  the director of wikileaks was found dead three days after assange started having mystery problems this is something i made a huge issue of here . .  streams of disinformation were spewed . .  themes supported by mr assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications very bad timing with that everyone with a brain noticed this and it lit up the forums and blogs . .  body double rumors have been circulated and documented . .  new strange hitherto unknown moderators of wikileaks have suddenly been installed . .  his deadman switch was activated before the armored vehicle even showed up at the embassy which means assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned much of his stored data and secret website pins were to be released in the event of his untimely death i released both deadman switches here one encrypted and one unencrypted . . all of this happened right after pamela anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned and the media talked all about how assange was pale and not feeling well when she left and that he said the food pamela brought him was torture good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the msm no doubt . . my take assange was poisoned and then removed from the embassy in an armored vehicle this was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss and i saw that and stayed up the entire night for it that is why i so strongly stated that he cant possibly still be at the embassy perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded . . if the new wikileak releases are real they are not coming from the wikileaks server  only a redirect to a different server in the name of wikileaks the ip address change

{"label": "hate", "text": "leave a reply .  phd  from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them . egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success . as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent . in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there  like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there  how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness . however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves  and make ourselves significant  by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions . this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth . the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness . i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration  something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there . there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other . as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan . the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands . the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names . the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off . witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging . their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status . i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows . as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness . however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world . tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity . there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection . in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep .  holds a phd in transpersonal

{"label": "bs", "text": "the man behind the  rally disturbance in reno  . usa today . the man who caused a commotion at a donald  rally saturday said hes a registered republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his partys nominee . members of the audience at the event for the gop presidential nominee tackled   of reno after someone yelled gun while others were trying to rip away his anti sign . i just went with sign that said republicans against   crites said its a sign that you can find online i held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands . crites had no weapon secret service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges . agents whisked   crites was near the front of the auditorium at the renosparks convention center . crites said he holds no ill will toward the secret service or reno police who were just doing their job . i was trying to get the secret services attention for them to respond said   of santa rosa calif who helped restrain crites they didnt respond i thought i had to do something i put my knee on what i think was his head so im not really sure there were five guys on him and he was moving i tried to help them immobilize him in final colorado push  urges supporters to handdeliver ballots .  said he felt as if crites were the aggressor . i saw his hand contact someones face he said maybe two people . crites said he didnt strike anyone but after he was taken to the ground he felt as if he were being mobbed . multiple people just tackled me down kicking me choking me and just beating me up he said thats when things even got crazier i was on the ground and people were holding my arms legs and i kept saying i can barely breathe i was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out . thats when police intervened taking crites away in handcuffs . s partner donald   of santa rosa took video of the immediate aftermath . the secret service said its investigation is ongoing the agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events . whats baffling to crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun his sign was in the air for some time and he wasnt making any sudden movements he said . it wasnt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me crites said thats not the case . he said he backs some gop candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with  not cause panic . i love all the people in that rally he said were all fellow americans theyre doing their patriotic duty they support their candidate im just there showing that im a republican im all of your peoples brother i just have a slight difference of opinion . later on facebook crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours contributed to her campaign and voted for her . take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence  against your own republican brother with a stupid sign he wrote the post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some  supporters on social media called him a clinton thughillary shill and  assassin . shortly after the incident at the rally  returned to the stage to raucous applause thanking the secret service and launching back into his prepared remarks his campaign later issued a statement also thanking the secret service and his supporters . follow seth a richardson on twitter setharichardson"}
{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "during the height of the cold war the cia attempted to develop mind control techniques with the mkultra program as it happens the communists already had a leg up on them well explore how this was done along with some new twists. the criticism and selfcriticism technique in history this is what happens to people who joke about chairman mao  s wardrobe. the technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union  this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during  struggle sessions  also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps . what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided. the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed. after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line. other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form  as ive noted previously  cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes. modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that  is actually a dude. when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things  this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus  also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors  besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal. we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood  this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for. the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth  writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems  tells an offcolor joke  or even wears the wrong tshirt  then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are. its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you. if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt  never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it. if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech. here are some other particulars to remember. you cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers  their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest. the frankfurt school  a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory  one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist. meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence  another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes . this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status. the educational system has been dumbed down  history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve. the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children  and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt. all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part. the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others  the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique. you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power. read more  common sjw arguments and how to dismantle them"}

will proudly make our victims during ww httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuabiehbia already happily started slaughtering them all around the world  aidan rodrigo johansson . the reason that american police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy  brain washed psychopaths that love killing it is american culture at the root deep in the psyche . the police have been militarized they dont do the job like in the old days no more negotiators drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun knife glow stick sandwich whatever  . how old are you the old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the s after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding accomplishment a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims note the escalation of crime since then it seems you are also on the anticop bandwagon i support them being able to defend themselves mistakes can be made in a split second the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop im sure you can name victims of cops do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute unfortunately the justified shootings like the ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions first and foremost dont commit crime that improves your odds drastically next comply with orders given by the police if you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you guilty or innocent comply the police are just trying to do their job dont complicate it ive seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car try walking a mile in their shoes they are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves fluffnik . guilty or innocent comply . land of the free . most places are successfully policed by consent and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime  . yes if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason if he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason he is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for  minutes before complying if you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and youll be gone without any violence or hard feelings if you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth of course if youve seen the news and the reality shows you may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government mike . wasnt raised hostile to cops family members are cops as a matter of fact this is america if im not committing a crime or suspected of it dont ask me for papers dont detain me dont run dui checkpoints those are infringements on all of our freedom which i assume we love safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior safety is a fallacy dufas_ . i have had  police officers in my extended family it got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the familys homes they were eventually never invited to family get to gathers they were rude overbearing malicious individuals constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject some familly member was wrong petty things like they didnt like the car they bought or their haircut or the job they worked at they were not satisfied with anything or anybody . they brought their street attitude home with them they couldnt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long they were arrogant mean and only thaought of themselvesanybody else was in their way . i have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds  . my greatgrandfather his soninlaw my grandfatherand his son my uncle were all cops the oldest and youngest for their whole careers all deeply religious highly moral men dufas_ . that is great if they were straight arrow we need more like them my cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the crips the bloods or just about any outlaw motorcycle club no one but other cops were proud of them my family sure wasnt proud of them  . maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily east side of detroit south side of chicago people are products of their environment maybe the cops in branson mo and such places are nice guys what is the ratio of cops to citizens lets say youve got a playground with   year olds you get a dozen  year olds to keep order among them if the  are from sierra leone and the dozen are american boy scouts thered be  dead americans in short order any dead among the  wouldve been killed by their own so what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet graduated from school and passed the academy you think  years of patrolling the gnetto might change them they surely know the realities of the job better than we do how do the ones who arent in mayberry do a  or  year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy dufas_ . i do know that where i grew up the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened they rotated officers to different districts every month but then they found thst the police were trading assignments some cops didnt want to rotate out they wanted to stay where they were no explaination was given by any officerat least publically no answer was given . many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst dufas_ . you just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members  . i dont think so but you dont throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool dufas_ .  send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool . you havent checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then a  year old in handcuffs or throwing an  year old to the ground doesnt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace anthony fredericks . i will end this stupidity of your right now gary i work with police every single day as a emt every day i am a qualified expert on how police act on scenemost of them are very arrogant rude and aggressive towards people shut up or be quiet is the first thing you normally hear from a cop you always see them put someone on the ground even if that person is the one who called them for help if they dont like youboom face down knee on your neck cuffs on approximately  are not like this but the other  are this is reality gary and i have worked in several cities in different areasand it is all the same police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general publicand a lot of them take it out physically on them  . my sympathies for the flaw in your familys dna dufas_ . luckily the flaw was only in the extended family treeinlaws marriages etc   . most people who oppose dui checkpoints have a reason ive always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive i dont mind providing my id when a cop asks for it when its done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident hes just trying to do the job we are paying for if you want to launch into a  minute tirade about your rights youll be there  minutes longer make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up maybe you like that some people love drama mike . the reason is its an infringement on your rights and unnecessarily exposes you and the officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation there is no way you believe that unwanted contact that is forced upon officers and the public increases their safety i wouldnt blame the officers for the policies they have to enforce however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact the problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong you dont see the infringement of your rights and tolerate them just because you arent guilty of anything doesnt mean your rights arent being taken from you what if for safety we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens what if we decided that tsa should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the us creating  hour delays what if we decided that anyone that supports trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning do you see where this goes . i dont like the immigration ones inside the states of the southwest i dont like the agricultural ones into california and i dont like the dui checkpoints in the south im a legal resident dont transport crops and dont drink yet i oppose all of them the idea behind them is wellmeaning the execution is unlawful imo obviously the courts dont think so or theyd not exist  . it is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself he does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk he stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim perhaps raping your daughter what would you do in his place mike . you are confusing the issues here zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime . dui checkpoints are  stop and question with zero probable cause have you been in states where they run these the road is barricaded even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are assumed to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned you are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint but the fact that they exist trouble me as do any checkpoints as they are not based on probable cause  . and youve seen these checkpoints at pm by a suburban baptist church no the probable cause lies in them being near the strip at am where there is a history of alcoholrelated incidents mike . i lived in the south these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as i could tell and while not at pm that i can recall they werent that late and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church i could have been naive about who was being targeted i wasnt just waived through once they saw my skin color but my point is that the location doesnt matter nor does the target demographic if there is one they are unjust and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement does not serve to increase the safety of leos . if police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid i do not have a problem with that they have probable cause and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it because they may be stopping a criminal stop me detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove i am or am not who they are looking for then let me be on my way . however ive been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red perfectly legal in my state and the officer was a complete ass enough that had i a short fuse it could have quickly escalated after that encounter and talking with the state about why the previously posted no turn on red sign had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop and threatening that they could have written me up and i would have to prove in court i didnt break the law just proved to me that some police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances that officer had no reason to stop me although i suspect since it was near his house and he is a rural county officer he couldnt control his road rage and by doing so he put himself at risk as well as me there are a million what ifs in that situation not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark along a fairly rural road by himself he didnt call in the stop which is procedure for that department i could have ended up shot or he could have and dispatch would have never known . increasing negative interaction with the public is never in a leos best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole dufas_ . i guess thats why the police looking for a skinny black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is  foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short foot  kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off . police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly aok . in the town that i live in police shot and killed a  year old kid while he slept maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets he could have emptied his clip . maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money a couple of bullets is cheaper than some cops time to find out what really is going on . of course some of those evil peoples relitives will probably sue but so what the tax payers will take care of that . how do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses gets arrested for your noncompliance . you would love my uncle he was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone after about fifteen years of bullying beating killing and making false charges against people the force finally fired himmeanwhile he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused it was anybody he could screw with . but in your mind police can do no wrongmaybe you are right police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation  . i dont deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldnt be or wrong splitsecond decisions sometimes think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from think about the number of times per day that an leo comes in contact with a citizen that taken into account bad contacts are extremely rare the sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they dont consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are the incidents dont sour me on the entire education system we need law enforcement you are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution will any form of policing be perfect what is dufas_ . how about having honest police and policing while percentage wise there is a small number of truley bad cops but there is always a but a large percentage of your good cops will keep silent lie or even cover for the bad cops that extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careerscops dont like whistleblowers . the example you used teachers having sex with students is perfect once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses not so within the police a bad policeman can get away with things multiple times sometimes going on for years the upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn even if convicted the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment . for years the public was kept in the dark about the bad cop very few were brought to justice only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated it is just lately after public attention that the police are starting to somewhat clean house . there are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers many are just put on probation others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration . it would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system a legal system can be whatever its practicinors want it to be a justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to quilified and absolute immunity for police das judges does not lend itself to anything close to justice . police are a necessary evilthe are some evil people in the world it is just too bad that many of them are police officers  . keep silent lie or even cover turn off the tv and go out i to the world some will agree with you but if youd said the same thing about black people thered be trouble dont you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules they also dont like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime probably but more so than the general population interesting take on the teacher thing i remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school he was no prize in his youth and i guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldnt resist she got pregnant and to add to a volatile situation her uncle was the superintendent of schools flash ahead maybe  years give or take and im a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school i work with a married couple both tenured teachers probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired downsized transferred or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers the hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle guess who yep dufas_ . ive been out in the world for over  years been beat by cops and then have them later discover i wasnt the perp they were looking for i was only lucky in that the cops didnt make up charges to cover their tails they just lied about what went down and covered for each other in this instance everything happened because i was driving the same make model color and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime on the way to jail a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down the perp had been caught and identified the cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle . i think if you would reread what i posted it was the cops that i refered to as being giged for turning in another cop not the teachers in todays world a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer if you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids i dont think you would have lasted in that positionunless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you  . no i wasnt referring to myself i was an outsider where the good ol boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll i think the guy in my story shouldve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again dufas_ . addendum . i get the feelig that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions even in the military soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up the soldier faces the consequenses but there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is aok like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood knocking on doors and a  year old kid opens the door while holding a ps game controller cop shouts gun and  shots lateran innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass thats the kind of policing that you want . yet a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent personthe mechanic can be held liable both were mistakeswhy should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be anthony fredericks . theres no excuse for killing a person gary we have laws against that no im sorry brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops no gary accidents like that are not excusable i dont care what job you have soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder why would it be ok for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it  . selfdefense is a valid reason and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs people like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker should only mma champions be allowed to be cops an unarmed attacker can kill you if someone breaks into my house at night i will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family i will not wait to see if hes armed or ask his intentions i wont refrain from using a weapon because i dont see him with one it is not a high school wrestling match we wont get up and shake hands after it is decided by score if this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once i will call a cop it is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation i was in when someone invaded my home fluffnik . i live in scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns mostly noone dies anthony fredericks . you mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his id to the cop or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air how about those huh gary i could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees anthony fredericks . so gary if i seen you walking towards me on the street got scared because you looked dangerous and i accidentally defended myself by blowing your head off then all i have to say is oh sorry my bad and because accidents happen everything is ok right take your head out of the sandpolice kill people when they think their authority is being challenged not their lives they are protecting their egos mike . while i wont disagree completely with your statement blanket statements are never correct some police may kill from challenges to authority in most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we not being in the exact same position should not second guess what we should be secondguessing are the supervisors chiefs and elected officials who hire bad cops improperly train their officers and put officers in harms way where they should not be the higherups never pay the price for those under them whose actions they are responsible for that is a very real problem if we want change we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them . programs such as stop and frisk checkpoints etc all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur that puts officers and the publics lives at risk neither is acceptable the easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur but you

who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused but when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs you expose your cause as being about something other

witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on   and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the s reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal  cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the  titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided   is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that   will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president  to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that  can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt pro theyre still all about defending the establishment but  is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing   to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let  take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time   and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the s is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the  coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the s are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the s are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the s attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the s are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as  s head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for  theres no love lost between obama and the s remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the  regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the s mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald  ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put  in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald  which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for   all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place   in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the  criminal regime donald  launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose  and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose  and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against   this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the s and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the s mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the s and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward   as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to save america and expose the criminal politicians bring out the marshmallows and weiners folks this is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to us history that anyone has witnessed in over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get and thank god  doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes or shed probably launch them just to change the narrativeas for me im with anybody whos trying to save america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in washington dc who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised the revolution is on anonymous wikileaks project veritas the fbi and the nsa have all been activated theres no stopping them now and all the details of all the crimes of the s are about to spill onto the stage of

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power   misesorg  october   comments . in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that  would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  . s position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  . while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases . this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups . in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply . in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens . in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing . this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low . contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today . when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself . the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland . it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority . it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority . these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state . in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard . voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly s remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power . in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a  victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege . the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles"}

{"label": "satire", "text": "keywords cardiovascular  diabetes  dietary fat  heart disease  sugar  sugar industry . sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt . researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar . at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat . ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods . as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines . warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week . lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options . yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change . recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis . jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure . another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol . the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity . the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults . the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad . according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease . add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem . it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance . in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine . when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now . we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods . food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item . every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars . widespread education regarding

{"label": "hate", "text": "a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october    . if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden . the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths . according to r executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights  added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines . the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of  stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths . the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david . among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths . preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history . unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco . earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site . unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference . whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday . dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem . most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution"}

to turn towards russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity. as red pill and coldblooded as it gets . brother brat in russian is a  movie directed by  it is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero. it has been a few years at least that i want to share my discovery of this film with our readers it had a tremendous impact on the way i see the world and the attitude i have towards life i was convinced of its quality of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of russian cinema culture it entirely deserves an article of its own. my brother the criminal . enter  played by the stellar  who died at  at the peak of his meteorlike career many called him the russian . after serving in the bloody war theatre of chechnya young veteran  returns home in the sleepy provincial town of tula. needing money and without any solid prospects he joins his brother  who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in saint petersburg being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality  adapts marvelously to his new occupation. . after seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end but even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice young  decides to take on the mob single handedly. an epitome of the russian alpha hard and unforgiving sober in words and in behaviour for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood. to err is human . his one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature convinced that if he does good his fellow man will be virtuous in return he could not be more wrong especially with women he discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness. what is rare and makes  stand out is his loyalty a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays his brother will do the unthinkable but after the storm clears and  emerges victorious he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance. no fancy green screen or politically correct themes . brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postsoviet russia this is how it felt when the wall came down everyone was trying to survive the best way they could. the odd lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty. you cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and  is an example of bravery alone and against all odds he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay. the man says it like it is his analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate. .  you told me about the city about its strength but here everyone is weak. hoffman the city is a great and terrible force it sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak it takes away your power and you fell right in the middle of it. his opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context. . american whats your power is it really money my brother says its money youve got lots of money  so what. truth is a real power whoever is right is strong you cheated on a man and took away his money did it make you stronger no it did not cause you are not right and the person you cheated on is that means hes stronger right. brother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways after spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank she tells . . kate do you have condoms.  why. kate why you really think i will give you back your money come here. two brothers for two majestic films . the second volume simply titled brother  breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good if not better than the original. same characters are followed but this time s brother in arms has been played by a crooked american businessman in touch with the muscovite mafia they attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his. again the movie is realistic gritty but has a lighter outlook on life whereas in the first volume the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from america and corrupted his country the sequel that involves s adventures and clueless discovery of american culture often results in hilarious encounters. un film qui prend aux tripes . if the red pill was a religion  could be

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "will china trigger the next global recession current debt level causes grave concern jing jin  misesorg   . chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and fair enough from comparing the outright levels it may seem that china can collapse at any moment .  suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by  we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively . for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus . apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers . the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from s how to think about china series provide some insights  . an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate . breakdown of assets of chinas financial system . this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily . financial asset structure us vs china  . data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma . it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve . the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields . in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner . data source wind ccdc . china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus . needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years . the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom . china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century . jing jin is associate dean at the china economics and management academy in beijing newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal. while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts. the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them. political naivetÃ© nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to . this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naivetÃ© can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naivetÃ© can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government . a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveÃ© because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions . accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles . if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  . to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative . lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far. lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine . doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them . the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings . . from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language. an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers. however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor. a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over. in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics. they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop. having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years . unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets . accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics . this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life . if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself . is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them . however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative . if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause. read more david frenchs candidacy for president shows that cuckservatives cant stop donald "}

here are seven things you need to know about  .   has a  percent liberty score on conservative review   has been in the senate for  years and has been described by the washington times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool per conservative review s biography  .   has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty for instance  was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill national review  which dubbed  amnestys worst enemy explained how  would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation    rla would find other clever ways to oppose the bill such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer     s opposition to illegal immigration putting sen  dnj in an awkward position . in   introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v davis supreme court case that  is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington dc mansion murders .  has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the united states . what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together  wrote in a  oped in the washington post  .   has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues according to conservative review s biography of  . in january  he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee in this capacity he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack  for not offering a serious budget proposal given that the senate had not passed a budget since april  he has fought guerilla warfare often a lonely battle against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryanmurray budget deal  has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state .  has voted against the tarp bailout stimulus bills and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the united states crippling debt per the washington post  .   endorsed  early on to the surprise of many in the establishment  endorsed  in february declaring  i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away this is a campaign this is a movement the american people are not happy with their government . it shouldnt have come as a surprise though given  record on immigration and that  tends to be more protectionist on trade .   is wellliked by his senate colleagues on a personal level according to the washington post  . say what you will about him former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well . even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him stanleybecker talked to susan parker a democrat who tried to unseat  in  during a debate she asked for a tissue and  handed her one she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when  made her cry and he responded please dont say that thats my nightmare i promise ill be nice . its no wonder then that  will likely be confirmed by the senate .  accusations of racism against  are absurd when president ronald reagan nominated  who at the time was a us attorney to a federal judge the democrats smeared  with accusations of racism which included calling a black attorney boy quipping about the ku klux klan i used to think they were ok but they are pot smokers joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups calling the naacp and aclu unamerican prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud . the last point isnt racist at all the jokes as ben shapiro has written  were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing  of racism acknowledged that  was joking clearly  meant them as harmless jokes  has also denied calling the lawyer boy the civil rights group  prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years .  record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism as the weekly standard s mark hemingway writes . as a us attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan henry francis hays for abducting and killing michael donald a black teenager selected at random  insisted on the death penalty for hays when he was later elected the state attorney general  followed through and made sure the hays executed the successful prosecution of hays also led to a  million civil judgment against the klan effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama .  as attorney general  would uphold the rule of law the reason why  has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty between that and his legal background as a us attorney and alabama attorney general there is every reason to believe that  will follow the law and not politicize the justice department . his interpretation of the law will not please everyone but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor robert driscoll  former deputy

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage for tens of thousands of years when boys hit the age of puberty they were forced to undergo a set of challenges. these challenges were meant to break them down and build them back up even stronger these challenges were meant to test them as men and they are collectively known as an initiation or as a rite of passage when a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him he became a man. our society for the most part lacks these rites of passage this is in large part why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men we have all of these  year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the west. despite this however i believe that learning game is a form of initiation it contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man it teaches boys to develop selfconfidence  despite what women think of them to become decisive and assertive and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will. death of the ego . one of the primary functions of a rite of passage is that it destroys a boys ego this is necessary for in order for him to become a man his identification with boyhood must be destroyed in other words he must cease to view himself as a boy and come to view himself as a man. this is in a nutshell what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion one rite of passage of the aborigines to be specific entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother. when a boy would reach the age of puberty the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show screaming and fighting to make it seem realistic the men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods. he would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time this sudden yanking from the motherworld of safety and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges symbolized his death as a boy. when the boy returned home he would view himself as a man he would carry himself taller he would interact with the women differently and he would have a new sense of purpose in many ways as i will soon explain game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it. facing fears . many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears fear of death fear of the unknown and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage as an example one native american rite of passage involved making a boy sit blindfolded on a tree trunk for three days straight. imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling the cawing and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men then add in the elements of cold and wind the bugs that must have crawled over his feet and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been. then once three days had passed a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold this again is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight he was blind and helpless then his vision returned and he emerged a new man. all throughout the rites of passage of history whether they be of the inuits the amazon tribes or the south african tribes there are some very common characteristics facing your fear being reborn and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations. why were these rituals necessary . upon contemplation it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary the world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in a tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military or safety if the men could not protect the tribe it would not be protected. imagine right now if a marauding band of  vandals roamed into your neighborhood they were all extremely jacked mean looking and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat a stick or a crowbar do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off. you being a reader of rok may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors i seriously doubt that a purplehaired complaining selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this. now try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors it was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle but being trained for battle requires more than physical strength. it requires ferocity it requires strength of will decisiveness assertiveness and a complete lack of fear these are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed for without them a tribe would go extinct. are these rituals still necessary . someone might point out that we arent at war anymore so these rituals arent necessary although i agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore i still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary heres why. men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this no matter how hard the marxists cry and clamor men and women are different boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves namely a tribe boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it because there isnt even a world of men anymore. the once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere the freemasons and various other spiritual organizations it used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere but theyve become a thing of the past. this is why in large part were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore we dont have any healthy male role models all weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms we want more but we dont get more. any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto theres no chance for us to prove ourselves theres no dragons to slay no enemies to fight off and no fears to overcome. and were suffering we can feel it in our bones not only are men unnecessary but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past we dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe no obstacles to face. learning game the new initiation . i believe that although it isnt perfect game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did. destroys your ego requires you to face your fears forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty develops confidence ferocity and a strong will again obviously game isnt perfect one could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think and i agree  but do you know what you may get into game for womens approval but any seasoned player knows that you actually stay in the game for your own personal growth. when men first start learning game they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be they think that learning game will get them girls and it does but something happens along the waythey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level. game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety and to live life fearlessly  by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life. learning game creates a wholepersonality transformation that cannot be found anywhere else no other hobby outlet or activity will change you as much as game does aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past. game makes you a man . game will transform you from a boy into a man for a vast number of reasons first off game demolishes your ego  a lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls. this is why so many men hate game and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly and most men cant take this when you start to go out and learn game you have one of two choices. accept that you suck with girls and keep trying to improve viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection most men choose the latter their ego is far too precious and they cant handle it being challenged those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego however will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined take my word for it. second learning game requires you to face your fears think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life of course so once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life in other words youre starting to develop a totally new personality that isnt afraid of living life and taking risks. game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty a lot of the time in fact most of the time you dont know whether or not a girls friends will be okay with you you dont know if she has a boyfriend you dont know if she lives nearby you dont know this you dont know that when it comes to game theres a lot of uncertainty. this is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it what other skill could be more masculine the men of the past revered this skill because its what their entire livelihood was based around. you see a pack of deer  feet away you dont know if you can kill them or not should you take the risk an enemy tribe is attacking should you run to your hut and get a better weapon or pick up a rock and do what you can youre injured and alone but you see a nearby village should you ask them for help would they kill you or heal you. learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia his life depended on it now the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other more extreme measures such as fighting in a war or something although even then you wont have much freedom to make decisions. all in all game will take you from a boy to a man it will teach you to be confident and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women it will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration. most importantly however it will teach you to overcome your fears in the words of my favorite pickup mentor learning game is an odyssey of the mind it teaches you to overcome your fears to face your lingering negative beliefs and to grow as a man our society gives us no right of passage so weve created our own go out and learn game for it will change your life. read more  things indian guys have to understand when learning game"}

pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress  is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless . in this spirit  obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam . detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of do who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees . obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the  mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context

adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature . formerly the magazines religion writer  is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the   out of fear of more reprisals . and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed s book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love . we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam   who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror . when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill . the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century  who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as s who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism . the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy . unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense . this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race . the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe  says . you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions . of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today . zineb  feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead do comrades . after completing high school in morocco  studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for do bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian . extreme personality cult . socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms  argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion . the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma  writes . if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip . you can be arab muslim and a free thinker . drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization s book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead . the greatest racism is  argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds . today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature . the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable . islamophobia whiners . destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable . what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty  concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance . . . the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it . western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior . as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics  tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit . history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said . according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within . the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability . for  the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says . survivor syndrome . women in the world asked  how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  . it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective . straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that . as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life . zineb  c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and do editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images . still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions . he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd . s deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it . we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says . life in a moving jail . since january  the survivor from do has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security . i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since  attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media . today i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them . follow emmakate symons on twitter eksymons"}

the winner next tuesday . by dr   there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections  talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks  if she will accept the will of the voters . of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals . but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans . what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected . it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president  before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from s fahrenheit  showing vice president  reading votes that elected president  ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which    amidst the greatest of controversy . so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty . unless  goes into complete meltdown over the next week a  victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has  losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected . notice i did not say  would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for  do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed

cause the never  people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention . so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions . as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination . the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself . so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray  such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president . it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count . the nightmare situation would be after a close election the  people or the never  people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like  anyway not to vote for  they could vote for  they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting . then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for  in the above  scenario it would only require two then  gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for  for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january . however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if  cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing  . but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny  the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and never independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible . while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat  and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for  the media could start inventing more reasons why  is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case . it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated"}

illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support  because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women . the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center . in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door. i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it. it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around. fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw . the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes. i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them. though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs .  ground zero . im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow  to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe. the ground zero for  within the manosphere was the  thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have. after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general  the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time. the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it. approaching the date of the election . two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for   and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a  presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if  doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency. obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat . not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment. for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of  saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge  by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign. i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink s candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully  responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down. the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that s support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that  was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug. . from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against  i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space. human control is a foolhardy endeavor . the most important lesson i learned from s victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination. george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even s own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably. think right now of how much effort the anti forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public. whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing. . now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled. you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes. if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness. conclusion we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes. im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next. read next what s victory means for men"}

november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day . a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that . more than four in  of  supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of  as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square . but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald s star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax . donald  took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over  s star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first . and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald s star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  . this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since  announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused  of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day . we have seen anti violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika . there have also been other disturbing incidents of anti violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece . on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a  rally  supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement . around oct  a couple of  supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for  gotnews reports the two  supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a  tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt . on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold  supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope . there is a move to get  supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating . of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a  victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge . for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald  loses the election . former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald  is not elected president . walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for  on november th if  loses im grabbing my musket you in . and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case  is victorious the following comes from usa today  . since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards  ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the  supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election . today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another . ironically donald  has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   . if  and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for s political enemies the s used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then . and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  . as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a  presidency would be . but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  . out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house . perhaps donald  can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it newsletter

{"label": "hate", "text": " a man journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam . in the final stretch of the election  rodham  has gone to war with the fbi . the word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi . but thats exactly what  and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director  is s opponent in this election . the fbi is under attack by everyone from   s people have circulated a letter attacking  there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting  it wouldnt be too surprising if the s or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi . the fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after  and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the     . the covert struggle between fbi agents and s doj people has gone explosively public . the new york times has compared  to j edgar  its bizarre headline   s fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for s resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women .  appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused  of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch . countless media stories charge  with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server . senator    a letter accusing him of violating the    act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of  as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the  act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against  ever . if  is really out to hurt  he picked one hell of a strange way to do it . not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave   a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect  by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer . either  is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs . the only truly mysterious thing is why  and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while   enjoys a  unfavorable rating . and its an interesting question . s old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi . pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic  associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb . there are two possible explanations .   might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign . but the other explanation is that her people panicked . going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her . during the original fbi investigation   was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that   is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive  campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi . theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior . the  campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot .  loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid . you can smell the fear . the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the  foundation its finding new emails all the time and world panicked the spinmeisters of world have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire . the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that   and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the  campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed . the s have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it . the campaign against  is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand .   has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "earlier i skewered nine dictators thugs demagogues and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy ethics and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong. franklin delano  . how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats. the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system. social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy. fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded. if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflation. at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general  wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began  said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only  had listened to his generals. fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later  barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them. e . how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america. the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is. until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters . if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses. many forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps . allen ginsberg . how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly. the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid. howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds. who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism. who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed. who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons. who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication. who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts. who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy. who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love. who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may . even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter. he was a noted critic of the usa for example. america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry. ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake. granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers. if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson . as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed. the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys . ted kennedy best friends forever east and west. how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from  until his death in  this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain. the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater. after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach. as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public . first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs . the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him. if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that e see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov. john lennon . how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the world. the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant. lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it. imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement. being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this. if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that. another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then. lennon do you know who i am. waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead. one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin. jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana. how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance. the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study. carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right. carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket. worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep

{"label": "bias", "text": "by rmuse on sun oct th  at  pm the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by  . as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney . apparently the federal bureau of investigation fbi director  never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr  did get a memo  from the department of justice in the form of a warning  but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election . since mr  cant keep it investigations in his pants or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president  to summarily fire fbi director  on the morning of wednesday november th  why should president  wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the fbi so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director  is apparently incapable of comprehending . this incident just like the one in july when  broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr  that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the fbi contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed  that was precisely what  told his republican buddies in a letter to congress . in the letter   told congressional republicans that the fbi really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent even though his agency the fbi had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr  publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome . it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr  precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the fbi cia local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law . according to mr  who was  stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive   he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress  even though the bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails  likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the fbi uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton . it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse  gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said  the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling  ms brazile demanded more information from  and didnt conceal her concern over  interfering with the election . mr  claimed very conveniently one might add that as a diedinthewool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in  and  respectively that he is not a republican now that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice not the federal bureau of investigation it was a suspicious  confession  in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just  days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything .  cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation if  hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july and a warning from the justice department this week then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention but since he was warned and is not an inept law enforcement official it is more than reasonable to believe that s most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november   because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like  might try but not president "}

{"label": "bs", "text": "south africa . issues surrounding a minimum wage bill education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the african national congress . south african president  has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the west to undermine the african national congress anc government which has held power for over  years . a myriad of challenges are facing the south african ruling party including an economic recession the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the united states . in africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers farmers youth and their leadership in the recent period in the south american state of brazil the first woman president  of the workers party was forcefully removed from office in a political coup . in addition to the decline in the south african economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward in an october report delivered at the world federation of trade unions wftu  th congress in durban south africa dr  the secretary general of the south african communist party sacp placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation the congress of south african trade unions cosatu within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles . in a recent article published by the agence france press afp president  emphasized that western powers want to remove the anc because they do not want the anc to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle this statement was made by president  on nov  laid the blame directly on certain western countries which do not wish the ruling african national congress success .  spoke to anc supporters at a rally in bushbuckridge mpumalanga province that the imperialist states were utilizing some anc members to further their agenda adding that some party members had been won over to the views of western countries the president said that those anc members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the western states . the political economy of destabilization . since  there have been substantial reforms initiated under the anc government there has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class the expansion of healthcare the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water . however the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class as a manifestation of modernday capitalism high unemployment rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery have continued . in all other countries the majority controls everything from politics economy and defense    its only in this country south africa where we dont have economic freedom its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us  stressed afp nov  . the president went on to say that is why they are scared that we will take away this economy they want to take away the strength of the anc because they know the anc is the only organization trying to balance the scales .  said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments the president had also spoke at the wftu  th congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle . recounting the history of the national liberation movement in south africa  said socialist countries like russia and china helped the anc giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle the socialist countries came to our aid it was russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight china and other socialist countries helped us . in addition  said the western states are retaliating against the anc government due its affiliation with the brazil russia india china and south africa brics summit the advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to western hegemony of the world economy . they are fighting us because we joined brics some are in anc gear but are in the company of the west we are at war we are going to protect the anc  emphasized . in an article published by the south african mail  guardian in reference to the stock values of holdings traded on the local market it noted should south africa avoid having its credit rating cut to junk in the next two weeks it could just be staving off the inevitable more than half of  economists surveyed by bloomberg said sp global ratings will strip the nation of its investmentlevel rating the median probability of south africa retaining its current assessment in december is  falling to only  in  the survey shows the economy faces a cut to junk on its foreigncurrency credit rating as output is forecast to expand at the slowest pace this year since a  recession delaying the governments plans to narrow the shortfall on the budget and rein in debt nov  . debate surrounds a national minimum wage amid allegation of regime change agenda . the anc government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of  rand which is approximately  us dollars  percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount bbc nov  . despite the possible introduction of such legislation it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household prof chris malikane of the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg suggested that  rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home bbc nov  . this issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around  percent over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery . two years ago cosatu proposed a minimum wage of  rand per month with inflation since  the amount would be at least  today . deputy president cyril ramaphosa said the  rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts ramaphosa said we are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage all social partners will now decide what their take is bbc nov  . the anc must address the issues of joblessness poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country local governmental elections which were held in august saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in south africa winning  percent of the votes in the august poll . a commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of president  has been involved in corruption  has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions the current anc leadership seems solidly committed to keeping  in office until his term expires in  . the party maintains that washington through its embassy in pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda party spokesperson zize kodwa stated in march they have taken about  young people to america to train them as part of their leadership program what we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change xinhua

friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between  and  would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience . then came word that  was playing hardball as s contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as    for getting his butt kicked by   watch . as  garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof   seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and  opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole  and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news . if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailespost it will be around  chris wallace and  and they are going to have to throw  and    a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr  were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr s contract is also up at the end of next year and mr  said were going to want  to stay with us mr s contract isnt up until  ms  has forged close ties to mr s sons particularly lachlan  who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the

note the grudging headlines because of s employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of s critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british owned newspaper for over  years . aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on  is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but  comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with  ripa the    show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated

opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted newsopinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention

{"label": "bs", "text": "when the river ran red  american renaissance september  . the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander  rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers  has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king  to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation . the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at  with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing  gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him . with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror  sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing s horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground . leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai  is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun . spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but  sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out  seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him . the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of s men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle .  remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river  knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier . prelude to war . the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers . the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island . when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own . for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness . it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value . exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west . the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable . retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king  he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples . he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited s capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom  said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and  agreed to give the land to the boers . retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and  formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from  inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend  as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed . as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed . the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to  as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom .  then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping . the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her . the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if s men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater .  arrives . the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni . this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if  could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith . it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named  answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu . his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager .  realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by  himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon . on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy . there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december   decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner .  drew up a message for  on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however  was willing to cooperate  wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to  he received no answer . on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle .  did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties  now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle . on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away .  prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain  chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack . the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a  innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night . battle is joined . in s own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure  wrote that it was a terrible sight . the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day . the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack  decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades . the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses . another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge  ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side . the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment . as the zulus waited for new orders  ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading . as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered . a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red  himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled .  divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that  was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds . the aftermath . early the next morning  ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo  had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power . on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by  giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box s men buried retief and his party on christmas day  .  fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory . the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes . yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms . the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants . to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans . the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after s capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black . the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different . if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers . the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost"}

{"label": "bias", "text": "by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by  . it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j   s candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of s reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded  supporters the real instigators are the  brothers . although the oil magnates were never on the  bandwagon they are responsible for the  loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced  are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker  out of a job although that is high on the  supporters todo list . as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr s supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr  had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  . the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader  conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member  issued a warning to establishment republicans .  theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  .  has been a thorn in the establishments side since  became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with  and establishment leaders who dared criticize  instead of using their majority advantage to go after  . donald  and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending  in fact besides assailing  for not sticking by  it is reported that  said privately that  should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the  candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party . this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald  has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get  out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the  brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it . two groups closely aligned with the  brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting . over the past few days leaders of both  groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome . according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the s and heavily courted by donald  mr needham said .  if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  . another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald  supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  . the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if  loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of s more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if  wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans . the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald  the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the  brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald  took advantage of to seize control of the republican party"}

rollerblades like yours .  croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in .  girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face .  always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long .  a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game .  you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america .  absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing .  cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else .  since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy .  dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  .  dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead .  croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game .  similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room .  the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  .  the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players .  if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar"}

especially if they had big nice legs ones like you just described though thanks but no thanks pass the rest of the ride in silence come to think of it the aliens i saw did have big nice legs five of them . the cabbie nods excitedly and these hollow black eyes and thats it . the cabbie is rapt with awe with fearsome ivory fangs . the cabbie signals you to keep going and five big nice legs and thats it . ah the legs i can picture it perfectly says the cabbie aliens i never heard of nothing like that before but i can practically see those legs kicking so nice and so big . the cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road im telling the truth the legs were big wait i just remembered the legs were small . yes those big alien legs the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle which goes careering up a nearby volcano his last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are i believe you . someone believed that you were abducted by aliens but at what cost at the cost of dying in a volcano start over . here we are sisters apartment says the cabbie great how much do i owe you leave without paying . this ones on the house says the cabbie thanks . youre outside your sisters apartment complex which is where your sister makes  per day working from home . you super trust and super admire your sister she is a master of logic and facts and you know shell have a high bar for believing your story youll need to remember a lot of good detail if you hope to convince her and youll need to hurry since your memory is already feeling a little fuzzy text your sister about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens send your sister nine emails about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens text your sister the alien emoji the abduction emoji and the outside apartment emoji . your sister answers the door immediately she invites you to sit down on the couch and hands you a microphone with the local news channels logo cube on it and asks you to tell her what happened i was abducted by aliens and i am going to tell you all about it stand back my sibling i am going to convince you that i was abducted by aliens . aliens eh your sister asks abducted by yes my sister they stole me from the atmosphere and now im back precisely now listen up my sibling here comes the tale . go ahead then says your sister tell me a story about how aliens stole you from the atmosphere it began like any other night it began right away with aliens it began right after the aliens had left me in the forest and disappeared . you begin your story . the alien light dissipated i was alone in the forest at night . i decided to hail a cab so i stuck out my arm in the universal sign for taxi immediately a cab burst from the forest . where you headed the cab driver asked i got in and told him to go to my sisters house the cabbie got out of the cab . it was then i remember the cabbie got out of his cab then he got back in the cab and thats all i remember . so says your sister if i have your story right you hailed a cab in the forest and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle and thats all you remember exactly theres more to the story let me start over . the next thing i knew he was back in the cab . where you headed he asked me again i told him to go to my sisters house he got out of the cab again . i believe you about the driver getting out of the car but i dont think you saw any aliens says your sister im sorry but thats just how i feel . your sister doesnt believe that you were abducted by aliens you have failed start over . the cabbie floored it and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sisters house which is where you live we arrived and i thanked the cabbie for his service . when we arrived i got out of the cab the cabbie and i pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes and thats the end of my story . well it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment but im sorry to say im not convinced that you saw any aliens says your sister is that really the whole story yes thats it there was more . then i dont believe you saw any aliens . ouch you really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens you are a miserable bard of the supernatural and your sister didnt believe you at all you have failed start over . your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony . it began like any other night i thought it was guy fawkes night so i was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself i would light the firework run back to safety look up and .  boom good riddance sir fawkes it was so much fun i decided to light another firework i wasnt having fun but i decided to light another firework . i lit the firework stepped back and looked up i expected to see a sparkling skyrocket what i saw was a sparkling skyrocket just as i had expected a strange light in the sky . yes it was a skyrocket my expectation was on the money . i prepared to launch another firework into the sky i loaded it up sprinted back to safety and looked to the sky again this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the butchers delight and the butchers delight it was and thats when it happened . i was right again in the clear sky above me i saw the firework called the butchers delight . i set up the last firework drew a match and lit the fuse it was a quick fuse so the firework had already launched by the time i turned around and looked up thinking i would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the salute to james buchanan firework but is that what i saw looking to the skies yes it was it was not for that was when it happened . yes my sibling the salute to james buchanan firework exploded as planned . i applauded at the fireworks finale congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as i realized that i had bungled the guy fawkes date again then i went home then i came right to you . thank you says your sister that was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself and did you see any aliens while you were at it yes no . well i dont believe you you only told me about fireworks i was expecting to hear more about aliens . you have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over . okay says your sister its too bad nothing happened with aliens . you have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over . a strange light appeared in the sky i ran but the strange light followed me i couldnt escape it there was a sudden burst of futuristic light . science enveloped me the light only got more futuristic then all of a sudden i was standing on the ufo deck . when the light faded i noticed that i was on a spaceship . this part of the ship was clean and triangular i noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity i could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space . okay i think i understand that you were on a spaceship says your sister get to the aliens though how about some aliens in the story when you were on the spaceship were there any aliens that you saw yes i dont know but my boss from my first job was there . my boss from my first job was there and he was happy to see me my boss said that i was dreaming and i said yes that seems right my boss said that i was dreaming and i said no thats wrong but it later turned out that he was right . hmm says your sister it sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens you had a dream about seeing your boss in space could that be right yeah thats definitely right wait i told the story wrong let me start over . you were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space you failed start over . there were aliens a crowd of them huge mighty creatures with skin like leather hollow black eyes and fearsome ivory fangs the aliens were shouting at me but i couldnt understand what they were saying jench crev amamu the aliens shouted but i could not understand . from among the aliens a bigger alien stepped forth i immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket the mayor took out a device . the mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes . suddenly i could hear everything differently the mayor then seemed to speak to me in english . welcome to my ufo said the mayor you are now wearing language glasses they allow you to understand anything that we say in our language but be careful it doesnt work the other way around if you want to learn how to talk like us youll need to visit the language room and earn a diploma from the language guide i told the mayor that i understood i told the mayor that i didnt understand i asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was . i dont know what youre saying but im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is . to do that i will need to tell you how the world works in the universe there are three kinds of things first there is us we are called people you can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big thick legs its obvious . second there is god god is special secret and far away and there is only one of him and we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever we dont know where god is but we are looking for him . last there is rocks rocks is everything else planets are rocks spaceships are rocks since you are not a person you are probably also a rockunless of course you are god but thats very unlikely and illegal i asked the mayor how to find out if i am a rock or if i am god . i still cant understand you but heres the deal im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while go to the language room learn our language then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you the mayor left and i was alone with the crowd of aliens . in the spaceships deck the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about god and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last i left the deck area and went south into the hallway . in the language room a man was standing on a small circular stage . above him hung a giant banner that read language tutorial for english speakers he began the tutorial . welcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for english speakers said the man if you are viewing this in hologram form it means our captors have determined i am no longer necessary and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison right on i waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram i continued watching the presentation . he was not a hologram . ha not yet i wish he said please sit down and lets get this presentation over with i sat back down and kept watching the presentation . lets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word crev the man began . he gestured in the air beside him where the word crev appeared in red light . crev is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something if you want to communicate effectively with the aliens its an extremely important word to know crev i managed to say creb i blurted stupidly . for example to announce that i am ready to point at something i would begin with the word amamu which means me then i would say crev then i would say what i am pointing at . like this amamu crev meryl streep i looked where the man was pointing i knew then that the man was pointing at meryl streep . hello said meryl streep i am definitely a hologram amamu crev meryl streep i said as i pointed at the meryl streep hologram . very good the next word were going to learn is important but be aware that it is very politically charged i am of course talking about the controversial word crevv and you must be very careful with it its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials crevv i said i nodded solemnly i asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context . here is an example of crevv used in english context oh god the aliens are killing me why did i say crevv why didnt someone teach me not to say crevv i shouldnt have said crevv i said okay i said nothing . crevv i said . no sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place i was dead . you wrap your story about the aliens . ah soyou died your sister asks yeah wait i didnt tell the story right let me start over . hmmm idoubt it says your sister . you told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died but your sister doesnt seem convinced . no one believed you you failed wait i didnt tell the story right start over . at this point youre almost conversant in the language you just have a couple more words to get through i am now teaching you the word jench it means god i said jench . finally the word bride is the equivalent of the english word um when you say the word bride it means that you have forgotten how to speak and you are trying to remember i said bride . this concludes this first and only module of alien language for english beginners thank you for learning with me get out there start speaking the language and remember if im not already dead please find someone who will kill me . with that the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the language room i left the language room and went back out to the ship hallway i went east . i was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room i went north"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "print . before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for  on nov  . first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you . second im not endorsing  in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate . third i respect those in the  camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the  voices i respect are columnists like  and    and evangelical leaders like  and  . fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over  as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st  i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of s failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see   this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation . fifth my decision to vote for  barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for  while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if  won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once  became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for  for two strong warnings about  see here and here  . so what has convinced me that i should now vote for  . the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in  latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide . first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected . second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel  is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote . third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole . fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for  to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat  and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home . fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between  and  were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for  . sixth  continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with  and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has  yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that  is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president . seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and  its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority . so in sum  my hope is in god not  and i do recognize that either  or  has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for  clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat  is to vote for  while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil . in the end if  gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice . either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive  commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for  alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email

their lives and their nations protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world it serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression. however in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments. legitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands. democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible  protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met. the antigovernment movement in bulgaria in  confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society. more gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup dÃ©tat made turkey band together the gezi park protests in turkey in the same year followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation. though justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts. methods of provocations and otpor. such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent these illegal subcontractors organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors academicians journalists and members of nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public. one of the most common groups among these  professional revolutionary organizations  is a serbiabased resistance organizationotpor  independent observers state that otpor organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the usbacked dissident organizations in many countries such as the former yugoslavia serbia georgia bulgaria ukraine egypt brazil and turkey there is a consensus that the cia has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries otpor its offshoot canvas. a relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings otpor . the otpor s  fistlogo would turn up  years later in the streets of cairo  illustrating further the preposterous foreignbacked nature of the egyptian uprisings serbias otpor would continue receiving funds from the west and become a ciacoup college of sorts under the name of canvas center for applied nonviolent action and strategies . the research article penned by carl gibson and steve horn and published on occupycom deals with the international financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents. serbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates  and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government . such examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups. likewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the  gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy. in truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts  and even civil wars  can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within"}

said was made to be  fathers and sons . baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said . anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball .

{"label": "bs", "text": " shares.    . credit   flickr. shortly after s crushing defeat the media came up with another spin  and facebook were held responsible for her debacle what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce  over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and s corrupt campaign organization for her defeat  labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population  was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt  foundation. the real reason behind the attempt to blame s facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president  as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite  was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush mark  visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the  award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between    who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the  regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy s minister of justice  has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means. there is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech. even restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights. in germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of s policy of government failure. internet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied. thus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion  but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger s quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google. at the beginning  rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for s defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november    wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him. a stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.  easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster.  third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more.  warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them.  related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed.  disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection.  listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. apparently  understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges. dear mr  take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal"}

the same new world order socialist philosophy. as profiling of internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly nudge us one way or the other politically one small step at a time. the management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy. why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do  which is why the apps need all that memory size. and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off. this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves. big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology. todays information technology has put big brother on steroids. the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about. mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth. most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement. if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information. hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands. the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases. as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we  the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done. this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be. think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities. think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think. little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind. once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple. but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone. soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet. obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office  an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is. so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search. someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial. our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be. read more

{"label": "bs", "text": "its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install  in the white house regardless of the true vote count . via truthandaction . . it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look . . . elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve. all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant. a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a  victory. a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a  victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring . political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with  securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote. the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations. its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained. even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election. in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported. election fraud expert  was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving. you need to have votes counted as fractions  said on the  show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money. if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden. vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it  pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them. all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for  that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people. source infowars"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "home this month popular what the  skeptics got wrong what the  skeptics got wrong  .  is a british and american nationalist who refuses to apologize for the british empire as a young man he took a presidents shilling and served in the us army in his free time he enjoys studying history and destroying the sjw revisionist narrative november   politics . there have been few true upsets in our history  crossing the rubicon wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world it is often said that when general  who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both  and   iss sword the band played the world turned upside down . today the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as is or  did at yorktown and i fully admit in spite of my vote for  i fully expected him to lose the polls his  negative approval rating and the sheer forces of the media the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him my skepticism of  was not his ideas but his chances of winning the election myself and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him were wrong . i am one of the intellectuals who expected a  defeat ive been studying politics history and economics for years reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations . and i was wrong it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for   beat the odds he beat the intellectuals and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after s resounding victory at austerlitz in  . the left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost they are calling  supporters racist sexists homophobic and even sex offenders but in the end it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald   was immune to almost all conventional political weapons  won because of the following .  the left seemed far more interested in calling  and his supporters racist than saying something of substance .  outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings and even tried to call them terrorists in this they beat even  in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid so they just lied to them and said fuck it those peasants will believe anything we write .  all  had to do was call them on their bullshit and call them liars and he was  right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem  called them on their lies and the american people who are tired of being lied to by the msm cheered him on even if he had a few issues with the truth himself .  the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled s own and she was bland and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive and she is corrupt and lied about it stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do .   knew how to communicate with people he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut and often times they are right . all in all the left failed because they failed to understand america they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha americans are not stupid they may not be smart but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece hillary took working class americans for granted and she lost this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted . i am pleased that donald  is now presidentelect he wasnt just a candidate he was the anticandidate he did everything a politician should not do he used vulgar language he talked freely about his ideas he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign he was the uncandidate america needed . i have high hopes for s presidency in spite of my tepid support i see  as a president who can do a lot of good and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory . first  spat in the face of pc culture and won just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election  defeated the sjws if  can keep this up we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness and get back to a concept called actually being correct . secondly  is an unapologetic nationalist he loves america and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country i look forward to seeing  abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists the british empire did nothing good for the world and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen . lastly  is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population this should rise under  as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault . i was a  skeptic i underestimated him i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe  of his platform but i had little faith he could pull it off and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability but like the liberals i was wrong and a canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were  right . i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something others say wow that is way above my head but when a true genius says something others say wow why didnt i think of that before  is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth without political correctness . and now he is

stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead . but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting . the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others . fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion . consider politicos often mocked fact check of  as to whether  was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline s week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally . were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable  had said . politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as  . there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is . the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like  and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue . in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility . the  evil fact check of  came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history . this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves . factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative . fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda . its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral . this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives . media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way . the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress . this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda . its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity . the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults . at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks s comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future . cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that  said  lies in one day . the list of lies included deeming s statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false . just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center . nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless . and those who do it often not only dont know the facts but dont even know what a fact is"}

{"label": "bs", "text": " . according to a report in the new yorker james   big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new  email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election . gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was  who was being investigated by the fbi .  explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  . we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record . the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general   who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill  to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that  is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election . heres s letter to the senate judiciary committee . really . the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi . thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something . this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine . on friday james  the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general   sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary s private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about  was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official  expressed her preference that  follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the out of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  . s decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials  who is a republican appointee of president  has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the out of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign . hillary  has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  . oh ill bet she does . ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that  decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach . of course when its her things are a little different arent they . we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her . and the fact that we know has severely damaged s campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over  due to the  email scandal . about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support  given fbi director james s disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of s use of a private email server while secretary of state  . finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary  . but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be . given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference . meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now . why did james  who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the s feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation . opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons . they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the  email negligence . they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it  isnt taking it gracefully . s complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before . this is from the telegraph  a uk publication . hillary  was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails . james  announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs  was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material . on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put   percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously . but wait  it gets better . the  campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr  alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs  herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling . its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida . democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which s as polls showed mrs s lead falling just  days before the presidential election . this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just bes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee . the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can . we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize . hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry

author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen s ties to militant chicago preacher rev  initiating a media feeding frenzy  has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print .  i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  .  hillary  . the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary  or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news  to her and  at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy . those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms s response to s question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic . while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress . womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result . let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that s overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary s stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to  citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press . s reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy  is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary  have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the s also have a long association . one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind s debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary  presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated s rise to power are fundamentally malignant . in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting  elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of s popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the  campaign the democratic national committee and the white house . the bottom line here is that hillary  represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates . the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government . media wishing to interview  please contact  receive s commentaries in your email bonus by

{"label": "hate", "text": "go to article . parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade . speaking as a phd in philosophy who has spent the last  years teaching at the college level im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablersi mean their supportersto revisit their plans . whether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any more specifically it is a bastion of political correctness a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition . for the last  years professor  who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh has taught literature at a range of colleges at the outset of each semester he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history what he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution mind you that is as old as humanity itself was practiced in virtually every society the planet over and that lasted only some  years in the united states was an exclusively american phenomenon  . most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america  told the college fix his students are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era . their entire education about slavery he adds was confined to america . yet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery over at boston university saida   an assistant professor of sociology and africanamerican studies tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething .  didnt stop there she asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new alllivesmatter . professor  added other enlightening tweets . for the record no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition . there is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life . before europeans invented it as such slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child . in case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant  offers a summation of her sophisticated position . in other words deal with your white sht white people slavery is a yall thing . in addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans  claimed that white masculinity is the problem for americas colleges . over at the university of pittsburgh students who were distributing prodonald trump materials were harassed and attacked  the trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech they were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and eventually physical aggression . one of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions . these students were accosted by other students students elsewhere however have had professors with which to contend . at the university of california at los angeles ucla a political science professor michael chwe wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by trump supporters this danger is real and must be confronted chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii even perhaps since the civil war . chwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting as opposed to accommodating white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the trump phenomenon we must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now though if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction . and it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom a math professor at mount holyoke college an allfemale school was recently captured on video launching into an antitrumpproclinton tirade in class while he never referred to either candidate by name peter rosnicks choice for president was plain this election rosnick said is the scariest that hes ever witnessed he told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of um should not be objectified . rosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country . at least one of rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts speaking on condition of anonymity this student told the college fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for . indeed . but this unfortunately is hardly an anomaly in  thus parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place .   a sexagenarian gay man in his letter to a local rhode island newspaper. a senior citizen and selfdescribed short little gay italian in rhode island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands after he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over  should not wear yoga pants the backlash against  was vitriolic  women marched on his home which was publicly shared using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest. in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response  received threatening calls and explicit death threats publications such as the washington post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of s letter and later comments which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in speedos would be considered inappropriate too. violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space. if anything the moronic march on s home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about for all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in america and harass without interruption an old white male albeit not a straight one they evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes where were the saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson alas the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible again. women tell men what to wear all the time i didnt see anyone staking out  home for telling her husband and other men what to wear image attribution . it goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense even beyond their relationships women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit here in australia an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative prime minister tony abbott for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit. because  had  women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments should men have stalked the residence of one jennie price a hack journalist from the daily mail  instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling price penned a ridiculous piece in  decrying socalled mamils middleaged men in lycra. she joined bbc journalist dominic casciani who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis  notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get i or my readers off at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning too when fewer folks are awake to see them by contrast yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga. naturally had just three guys  let alone  or  made their intention to protestcycle their way through  neighborhood in britain the police would have been called the same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear and lets not forget women telling each other what to wear a number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear especially on the celebrity red carpet i wonder how many times for example then zombie and now dead zombie joan rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it. sending a tweet is violence but  people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in the national debt nah terrorism nah urban crime nah these folks are protesting fashion comments. at the start of this year i brought you the story of holly michelle wood  a putrid harvard phd candidate and feminist who went around calling white people awful after the now banned milo yiannopoulos simply retweeted woods criticisms of him fellow feminist catrin cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a twitter stooge michael margolis to alert its founder jack dorsey we would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence. as  clearly feared for his safety during the march potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent a climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion. at a minimum the target of their fury must lose his job reputation and sense of personal safety to satiate their desire for revenge in the meantime the very act of their protest and abuse which is not interfered with validates the idea that women are not the targets of systematic hate or oppression in society. as a gender women particularly the middle and upper middleclass women who seem to dominate these kinds of pointless abusive protests have nothing to complain about except maybe having too much time on their hands. read

the emergence of your soul consciousness as you allow it to become the reigning influence within your life this means you begin to listen to the wisdom of your body elemental and the signals it sends as to what is appropriate for your physical and emotional wellbeing your dna and the cells of your body begin to integrate the higher frequencies of light and gradually you begin to vibrate and attune to the refined energy of the new age this period of the transformation process could be likened to a death of your old selfconsciousness which is really the process of removing the veils of illusion as you integrate each new level of your oversoulhigher self you absorb the wisdom and illumination of that facet of your vaster being you are in the process of shedding the multiple layers of density which you have absorbed within your auric field down through the many ages of earthly experience the saying the light shall set you free is a true statement for the light is dissolving the layers upon layers of negativity that you have carried for such a very long time you begin to function within an auric field of refined light of your own creation as you turn inward and learn to stay focused and centered within your sacred heart in the power of the now moment over time you as light transformers begin to draw forth and integrate the maximum amount of adamantine particles of creator light and you then consciously radiate forth the remainder out to humanity and to the world when you achieve a certain level of harmony within you open the physical body gateways or portals to the higher dimensions the ascension chakra or the medulla oblongata and the vagus nerve at the base of the skull and also the back portal of your sacred heart and your sacred mind these are major steps in the ascension process when this process is complete you are well on your way to gaining access to the first sublevel of the fifth dimension where your entrylevel sacred triad is waiting to welcome you the adameve kadmon body is your original individualized seed atom godself in a fully conscious light body form created by the elohim lords of lightbuilders of as the archetype of humanity the adam kadmon embodies the original complete divine and spiritual nature of manwoman it is not the same as your personal oversoul body of light which is itself evolving towards divine consciousness your higher selves your spiritualoversoul body and your sacred triads are refracted facets of your god self your original light body the kadmon light body has the ability to take on any form necessary to create and experience all forms of creation in your fathermother gods plan for this universe the adameve kadmon is a spiritualphysical creation which incarnates in the planetary worlds during all cycles of divine creation physical body  in the beginning awakening process there is a desire to turn inward and to listen to the inner wisdom of the soul this soul awareness includes your body elemental the memory seed atom which contains the perfect blueprint for your original adameve kadmon light form emotional body  first you become aware that your emotions control you through your wants needs and desires which in the long run do not bring you a sense of happiness or satisfaction you begin to turn inward and to question your life choices asking awhat have been the results of your actions you begin to seek answers for the pain and dissatisfaction in your life the voice of your superconscious mind becomes stronger as you gradually take heed and follow your souls guidance as you become comfortable and begin to rely on this voice of higher wisdom the egodesire body gradually relinquishes control and the soulself becomes the director and guiding influence in your life you begin to align your will with the will of your higher self for you have gradually learned to trust the inspirational and intuitive thoughts from your sacred mind eventually you begin to view all interactive events in your life from a higher vantage point you develop emotional detachment through a more refined view of human interactions having experienced most of the important tests of the emotions you develop a better understanding of the human emotional nature again you learn to go with the flow and you view your tests and challenges as gifts and opportunities for growth you have learned to make peace with the past and to script your future as you endeavor to live and focus on the now moment gradually over time the vibrational patterns of the emotional body are lifted above the magnetic pull of the physical realm the mental body  you begin to realize the limitations of your subconscious and conscious minds and you see how rigid limited and stuck you have been in the mass consciousness belief structure you willingly begin a selfanalysis process whereby you reevaluate your attitudes judgment and programmed concepts you begin to feel a burning desire to expand your knowledge beyond your physical reality as you seek to learn why you are here on earth and the greater meaning of life your instinctive mind gives way to your higher intellectual mind and gradually you gain access to your sacredintuitive mind as your soulself becomes the director of your destiny your life begins to change dramatically for the better then faith and trust become an inborn certainty that all is happening in divine order you also know with certainty that you are on an upward spiraling path to a more refined harmonious and loving reality all you have to do is stay in the moment and take one

move into an accepted spectrum of light and shadow your goal is to develop the ability to stay centered within your sacred mind and sacred heart you learn to consciously maintain a higher perspective about what is going on around you as you express compassion and unconditional love for everyone that is the goal of a selfmaster as you become attuned to the higher frequencies of light you will

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   by    . ill bet that ag   is shaking in her boots right now because when   s career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates .  s ties to the s go back to  when thenpresident bill  appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president   heres her official bio  . in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general   who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the irs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill  . it all started to publicly go downhill for  during the first investigation into s carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director  was to meet with  to interrogate her about the subject  was busted having a secret meeting with bill   the washington post reported . s private unplanned meeting with attorney general  e  at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of s use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation .  has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer  at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said .  said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b  bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public . of course it was all much easier for  to abide by the decision when  miraculously found that  was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets . now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general  and former president bill   . on june   attorney general   is reported to have met privately with former president bill  on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs s email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs  and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting . republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill  may have offered to extend s position in the ags office during a  administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment . last week ag  blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported . attorney general   is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that  has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  . it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue . as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison . how very judicial of her  tried to shut  up about the new investigation into the  emails . now even the mainstream media cant turn its head . earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director  made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the  emails but lets talk a little further about s desperate attempts to shut him up . the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged  against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b  sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed  email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections . how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with s decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno . poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the s she was also sworn in as ag under bill  and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  . she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill  never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated . she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom . the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements . the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat . every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to whitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc  cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her . but no such attorney general could have survived the  scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact . attorney generals who have anything to do with the s dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in  scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out  can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads . the last time  was involved in the  email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director s recommendation  . i wonder if shell make that same promise this time . she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the s the last time around and also this time when she decried s release of information about the investigation . i wonder if she and  will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out . courtesy of  dont forget to follow the dc clothesline

fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc . earlier this week  and  shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials  and  say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters . i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year  explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot . in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots . after the report was first published and shared on facebook by  fairfax county democratic committee executive director  replied to s post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained . these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented  . that triggered a quick backandforth between  and  . i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope  said . like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network . impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied  . then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said  who should i believe you or my lying eyes .  then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives . i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded  . the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america  protested the premise of the story . please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated  in an email in which he also explained why he believed the  account could not be accurate . he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy . in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the  version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true . its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats . voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed . the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax . listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson . however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself . that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said . its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said .  is standing by her story  percent as is her husband  says its a very clear memory .  opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed  said . the coverage of s story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit . i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename . get the hottest most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just  seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts . another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones  and  shared last week . neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot . they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else . its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said . there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading  to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and  discovered with her ballot . i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that  said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues . neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true . i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said . he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight . i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened . the

rist february    comments . inglewood ca  on sunday police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around  am when police arrived they engaged in a minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle killing them both . in the news release on monday following the shooting police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun  a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers commands to exit the vehicle the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car  killing the couple . the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital according to the la times . the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day mayor  while responding to questions about the shooting opened up a huge can of worms  both the man and the woman were unconscious . for at least  minutes police attempted to rouse them in an effort to deescalate the situation said  . after admitting that the couple was asleep  quickly defended the officers noting obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened . however that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch nor did the couple have any reason to be violent . both of the victims were parents   a single mother of three sons and   a single father of four daughters .    stated the obvious when she said that its possible that  merely passed out on the way home from their night out . families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off according to nbc los angeles . the police aint telling us nothing said   after being met with tight lips from the department . he was a loving father said lins sister  all he cared about was his girls getting them right . of course as is standard procedure for all those killed by police their arrest records were released to shame them  was on probation for a misdemeanor last year and  years ago lin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles . according to his relatives lin had a rough life but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver . sadly these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops scared of a sleeping couple share google  concerned citizen . perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept at least they didnt drive drunk these parents did not deserve to die mary hagerty . did she really have a gun or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon conscious . lets say they had a gun how did the police see it if they were asleep hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel . who gives a fuck about driving drunk it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congresswe encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui get a grip this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry kevin burnett . sounds like more blackliesmatter twits alan lammle . sounds more like bluethugliesmatter twits duryea l williams . smhignorance is contagious talisha harris . no where in the article talks about that movement from the article it sounds like innocent people who were not armed and who were sleep were killed did i miss something anon ymous . they may or may not have had a gun but having a gun is no reason for the police to shoot  kill someone nikkia bailey . maybe they were too drunk to drive anon ymous . black lives matter also what part of that is so hard to understand kburnett isanidiot . stop being an ignorant fuckwad racist troll kevin turdnett philip williams ryan robbins . marie laveaux  im not disagreeing with you i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions not just a headline i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence julie asperger . on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road both are illegal seemed strange the way it was presented to us this makes it even weirder i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them to bad there is no video to see what really happened . cops dont like being filmed . for obvious reasons julie asperger . yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press kimberly reichard emerson . the intelligent of us know were not i cant even comprehend whats wrong with the people here that still believe were in the land of the free and home of the brave its frightening to say the least shawn soto . this is so fucked upwtf is wrong with people why cant any one just act right all you fuckers carrying so much hate on raceits ridiculous im sick of it an alot if peeps an i mean alot are following an feeding this shit through media an all i hve mad love for all race in the world am does any one even hve a pure blood line now a days i think not so dont be fooled by just the way your skin looks . we all belong to the human race theres no other race than that thom prentice . nice infotisments colin parker . i never understood why their prior arrest recods are released its not admissible in any court for a current charge so why are the police allowed to use it alan lammle . to help soften the public in their attempt to make them look like they did nothing wrong in shooting  people in cold blood gary harryman . shouldnt the records of every cop at that scene also be released tray pressley . to label them as criminals so they can justify the murder markymark ndahouse . to demonize the dead jamesawyatt . as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops  they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds    but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd    as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury andor death mary hagerty . i agree but please dont use all caps to write its way harder to read roberto carlos moscoso . sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns yet ive seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of irresponsible citizens crazy ah tracy walling otis . is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese thats truly horrifying if so if you have a source of those statistics i would appreciate the link for it i know its bad im not denying that but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad  . ive read that cops killed more than  people in the usa in the last  years but im sorry i dont have the link you can search and you will find it easily i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists alain vosselman . im stunned i can no longer believe this this is going to be talked about in the future if we still have one just as we talk now about stalins regime or sadam husseins or pol pot from now on even if we discover new life  triljon lightyears away traveling by megasuperfreakaliesh tech vehicles well still be the most amazing embiciles of the universe aaron beedle . the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is i would not want to be a black person living in america today i wouldnt live there at all nothing will happen to the officers they should be sentenced for murder and receive a full sentence police officers over there intruding on peoples property and killing pets killing people just walking down the street or washing their car id i was an american the only reason id want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers ryan robbins . you shouldnt believe everything you are reading online its bad right now but its not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories its on page  and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice aaron beedle . it is true everyone has agendas im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes i would say that at least  of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably females would be close too when it is appointed rather than earned such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease people tend to not handle it well i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves and they are made to it teaches people restraint christopher rawson . the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another that human is a human none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our headpossibly there is another way tim walker . i suppose if everyone voted for that one independentlibertarian candidate then maybe we would have a fighting chance sadly that will never happen the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose how can anyone prove that it wasnt predetermined . i just watched a news video of this story the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived police spent  minutes trying to rouse them and deescalate the situation how is there a situation to deescalate if they are passed out ?? ???? . ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened all he said was that another source had different information if another source has clashing info of course one of them is going to be wrong no need to bash him vanessa white . some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy i would never call them for anything they dont seem to know who or when to shoot or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time pitiful i will keep the children in prayer blue thugs . all cops are cowards never seen one that wasnt a coward and bully one of the cops got tired of waiting and said gun that was all the excuse they needed to open fire what if that was a white couple with a gun in the carnearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit do you fucking think the cops would have fired  rounds into that car and killed the white couple well do you if one of the thug cops did holler gun no one can ever say anything to contradict them cops know if only one side is left alive no one can say otherwise better to be judged by  than carried by  that is every cops motto as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans linda brown . chickenshit bullies this bs has to stop i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada first nations peopledrunk  drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live every skin color fair game on last two for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing  open to public   a fair trial  and then deal with courts decision im not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one usn veteran . bt i respect your opinion however do not fully agree with you i do know a few leos good stock adult scout leaders and there was an officer from my childhood past whom mentored me however i can not defend other leos actions i firmly believe that an armed society is a polite society . arizona state constitutional provision  article  section  . the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men . arizona respects the right of all us citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit or to carry openly while in this state an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity . castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep  bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions . as such arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california how does extrapolate these facts perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives whereas californians do not perhaps californias draconian laws encroach upon human mental health whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence . i for one shall leave this contemptuous state seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring i shall make arizona my final resting place i expect in this forum environment there may be egregious comments to the final resting place  . i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment . usn veteran margie campbellthreadgill . maybe i missed something in the article but does it state that the cops fired  rounds in the car if so i missed it fed xxx . department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnt make you immune in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last  years doesnt excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please dont fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference look for yourself . how is anyone white or black ever supposed to trust a police officer these days blue thugs . fuck you dude my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too you are biased im not and leave ppl alone they never bother with flat tires so fuck off chris cochran . every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman . yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime since they acted as a gang they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime  murder terri spanjer . i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last  years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year its all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you  ps  yes  was an inside job think . american cops have been given free rein to do whatever they want  the government encourages police brutality lucas vegen . i dont understand maybe im to young maybe the uk is completely different . black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol . i learned at a young age the country will only change when its forced to black people need to stand up we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores court rooms and banks in the s or s if money and property is all they care about . more may die but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in really . this is not hate talk but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep i dont think talking should be our last effort how many more will die . it wont theyre killing everyone now desiree m mondesir . insane i know all cops are not like this but the ones who aregod help them or rather god help the people they senselessly murder and their remaining loved ones how on earth does a sleeping couple threaten you causing you to fear for your life b alan eisen . i fell asleep in my truck on a very cold night in front of my house a police officer wanted to arrest me for sleeping in it but the night was so cold he got numb hands and left ross thompson laurie choate . this of course will be swept under the rug as quickly as possible they messed up bad on this one i would love to see the dash cams vids but im sure that too is now gone very sad that we can no longer trust any person in uniform . how does one deescalate a situation where the occupants of the car are asleep david lynn courtney . freaking terrible and shameful roomtempiq . the entire legal system is skewed in favor of those who have money no doubt black folks are unfairly targetedabusedkilled by cops but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well but us poor whites dont seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks . that being said i recently moved to a very rural county and the sherriffs deputies here are standup good guys they are not cowards or bullies that is one reason i moved here b alan eisen . i wouldnt compare rural life with inner city life at all rural people respect each other they help each other the police are neighbors you can explain inner city hell to yourself ?? ?????? . in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed of all was  . so far in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed so far as of february  is  . but more whites than blacks you say simple only black lives matter to the main stream media their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another also imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police when are whites going to loot and riot thomas headen iii . you riot when your sports teams lose or win for that matter percentages sir say that black men are  times more likely to be killed by police than white men i think if the percentage were reversed you would be alarmed as well god bless  mcmaster . to put it in perspective if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youd expect that for every  people shot  of them would be black and  would be white or to put it another way left handed people are about  of the population if it turned out that year after year they were  of the people killed by police it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally anna black . whites loot and riot during sports the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens daniel robins one yahoocom . woops they did it again todd schacherl . so now sleeping while black is a capital offense if only they had cooperated while sleeping they wouldnt have been shot is that what we are to believe deloren tucker . wtf john and linda robel . the blue code of silence is well established and routinely used tim egan wrote breaking blue a book that documents the historical corruption of these big brave heroes orwell was right  big brother is watching and the pigs are running the farm line these pos up for the firng squad and make their families watch john and linda robel . keep voting for democrats all you stupid sons of bitches and kaliforniacators im sure gov moonbeam feels your pain . must have broke the lawblue lives matter every cop apologist dickhead on the internet . whats wrong with the cops they couldnt wake them up its a shame nancy keys . they had me confused when they said the womans  name  blue thugs . everyone in america needs to watch the documentrymovie called  peace officers i bet a thou to a cops doughnut there was no gun even in the car if so it was planted after killing them probably stayce . wow i didnt know things were this bad  it just seems that being black is so wrong anymore why do these things keep happening i just ask that all cops and law enforcement be mindful of what they are doing and double check their situation before over reacting now kids are without parents this is ridiculous bless the babies and their parents lincoln kirby . huh i always thought the conscious scared the police more ie us oh wait they cant tell whos conscious and who isnt why was i born with less rights than my parents and my younger family member born with less freedoms than i was born with the fuck happened did we stop thinking ?????? ??????? . fuck these kind of mother fucking piece of shit police who are just bullys with a badge and a gun hope they all

indiscriminately this isnt the wild west this is a war zone i know guns can be a tool as much as a wepon a knife a stick  a rock a fist can be a deadly wepon how do we fix this start making every stich of clothing out of kevlar replace fluoride with prozac can we learn anything from places that dont have a problem like iceland it has to stop the officers involved should have been interviewed by civilians before the went to police academy maybe they werent good with serve and protect . show me the video dksman . wtf this article is full of major inaccuracies they werent parked on the side of the road they were in the middle of a major street right in front of an intersection they didnt pull over and go to sleep all you have to do is loom at the crime scene photos and see this article is full of false information they had a gun on them as well catherine durnfordwang . so for that they deserve to be shot and they had a gun so what again arent guns allowed under the second amendment zatanique . how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved i cant believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops police department and city i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them the police department and the city because of these cops  children are without their parents no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did . on what planet could you possibly justify what happened smh for real . i cannot even grasp this if they were not conscious why didnt they try to make sure they were not suffering from co poisoning oh no lets just shoot them and make up any story we like huh david sbraga . if you only had the courage to say that to someone face and not while th were hiding behind a kevlar and screen id pray for you but i dont believe in prayer and i dont believe it would do you any good mark nasia . parents on a date were asleep in their car does this headline make sense i mean two people shot while sleeping in their car makes more sense that date would have happened before they decided to sleep where are the editors these days . jevez robinson paul myers . surely the same laws should be used and policemen and the hiring officials as is used against gangs and organised crime lets face it the police force is the biggest organisation of organised criminals in the world . blacks latinos asians and progressives must compete and vie for every civil service job once on rise in rank and change the system genevieve friday king . two exhausted parents falling asleep in a car in and of itself not news hell ive been at work and college and found parents zonked out from exhaustion from parentingbut to be executed like this uh were the cops afraid the parents would wake up and ground them for a week or a stern talking to johndca marible . these cops need to stop it so were suppose to believe that this woman and this man with  children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun were really suppose to believe that story i dont understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun training on top of that a partner and access to call for backup i just dont get it if youre that afraid of a black person on sight then you dont need to be a police officer you need to seek help last time i checked it was black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around yeah the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of blacks by police not by a longshot im getting really tired of this and the whole usa needs to revamp its law enforcement system you can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us

the nutritional content of the food what it does to the food provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health provides beneficial enzymes increases the amount of b vitamins biotin and folate increases the bioavailability of minerals provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function provides you with gaba your calming neurotransmitter how can eating fermented foods help me optimize your gut health . why this may not seem like a big deal it is your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut your gut may be in bad shape from nsaids antibiotics unknown food allergies the standard american diet and more . ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the standard american crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome . so you can take all the supplements in the world but if your gut is in bad shape are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money . a healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system immune system digestive system and nervous system so as you can see a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing support your immune system . the more beneficial bacteria you have the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds flu allergies and more almost  of your immune system is found in your gut thus it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system one needs to support their gut health . asthma and autoimmune conditions among numerous other health issues are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut the less diverse your microbiota is the greater association with many chronic health issues . adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection aid in weight loss . studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weightdifficulty losing weight obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals . in a  study it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study in a  study obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for  weeks those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group digestivebowel issue improvement . those with ibs or ibd may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet dr david williams states that to eliminate digestive issues you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods kefir in studies has shown to improve symptoms of ibs and ibd research has shown that anywhere from  to  of those who make this change adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their ibs symptoms improved mental health mood control and behavior . the gut is considered your second brain a healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies for this reason to get more variety of probiotic strains it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over mix it up for instance have kefir one day kombucha the next fermented vegetables the next day and so forth . many of you know that gaba is your calming neurotransmitter but did you know that fermented foods can supply you with gaba too oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase gaba content significantly whereas gaba in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues . another study looking at  college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety fear moodiness worry envy frustration and loneliness . it is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed gaba even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders reduce the risk of brain diseases such as alzheimers . some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that alzheimers disease is in fact an autoimmune disease and as many of you may know having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road for any autoimmune disease the immune system must be supported so it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for ad if you want to support your brain than i suggest that you add in fermented foods . along with the benefits above fermented foods can also benefit those with autism and help prevent hpylori you dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say  tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day what to add in . . look for the product to say raw and fermented these foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold dont heat them up bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods kimchee  this is a korean version of fermented cabbage carrots onions and garlic kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk it has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt i buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast if you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir if you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion avoid the kefir until issues resolve opt for the other fermented choices instead tempeh indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture a good vegan source of protein too kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea most stores carry a variety of flavors now dont go overboard on the kombucha however some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts ie several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces a miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make . notice i did not sat yogurt while some yogurts may contain some probiotics many others are sugary processed foods in disguise yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods . sources"}
{"label": "bias", "text": " stupid things voxcoms  has said by  october   .  of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently  agrees with this sentiment  deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations . fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that  has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly . here are  things  has said that are incredibly dumb .   was convinced that people would love care that is until he didnt  matt care marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   . his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing  also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when care becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten . in other words  felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the  administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent .   made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov  r in a  tweet that is now deleted   s reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping .  doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode . eventually  backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about s life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff . the irony of  saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt matt its clear that s a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff   exjon june   .   once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which  highlighted a passage from  who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option . i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn .  agreed . ive long held a related theory about eric cantor . anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted .   advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space  wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated  pontificated . northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time . yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time . but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone . ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy . if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas . pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid s time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that  has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about . apparently they dont .   doesnt understand floridas geography very well  wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami . id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know  said . people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish . yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated  wrote in an update . except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe  shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud .   thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician  found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government . for better or for worse thats politics  wrote at thinkprogress  . on twitter  attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes . and yet  had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter .  must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident .   once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to  writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis  also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency .   doesnt understand the purpose of the senate  wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  . if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population . now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them . in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense  missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations .   doesnt understand americas financial system  showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time  bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous .  they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance . davis debunked s argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  .  arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation .   thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography  started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself Ã  la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist . this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  . actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal .   expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death  tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead . this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended  stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion . apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and  certainly does not possess the latter two qualities"}

peace and exhorting the earthlings to take me to your lizard the storys protagonist  has this strange request explained to him by his friend  an experienced galactic hitchhiker . it comes from a very ancient democracy you see . you mean it comes from a world of lizards . no   who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people . odd   i thought you  it was a democracy . i did   it is . so   hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards . it honestly doesnt occur to them   theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want . you mean they actually vote for the lizards . oh yes   with a shrug of course . but   going for the big one again why . because if they didnt vote for a lizard   the wrong lizard might get in got any gin . what . i    with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin . ill look tell me about the lizards .  shrugged again . some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he  theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it . if only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them . if there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the  report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the usled world empire . do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades or centuries of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not . but dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have  and if she didnt feel free to tell other people that i  it if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal . or take hl mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped  . the stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods . or take lysander spooner who wrote  . the principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that  however bloody  can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave . or wendy mcelroy who reminds us that . voting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you . yes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too . but as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted . so if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next  days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions . find join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area . find join or create a community currency  community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area . commit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy  false flag terrorism  gmo crops  or any subject you feel strongly about either offline or online using the work of others or by starting your own blog newsletter or community meet up group . learn about gardening  canning appliance repair d printing  monetary theory  or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse or even if the government doesnt collapse . read more books spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop learn a new skill and teach it to someone else . in short do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day because if all you ever do is tick a box

water crisis started in june the municipality has been able to supply water for only one hour twice a week  told al jazeera i am checking the weather forecast every day they announced rain three weeks ago but it has not come yet the only thing i can do is to pray to god . many west bank communities are facing similar problems amid an acute water shortage that has lasted for months in the salfit jenin and hebron governorates some villages have gone as long as  days in a row without running water . in midjuly residents in the bethlehem area staged a sitin for days to protest against the shortages sparking clashes between palestinian youths and israeli forces . it is a very stressful situation i have to consider and prioritise every single drop of water i use  said we have barely enough to drink cook shower and use the bathroom sometimes i dont do the laundry or clean the house for weeks it is hot and dusty this is exhausting  shows her garden which has turned brown due to the severe water shortages since june eloise bollackal jazeera . some palestinians have joked that the water bill collector comes to their homes more often than water as demand rises the cost of drinking water has skyrocketed with some families spending up to  percent of their meagre incomes to purchase it . israel implements a policy of water cuts each summer but this year it reached an unprecedented peak in early june israeli water company  informed the palestinian water authority pwa of summertime supply cuts totalling more than  percent  and the cuts while not as dramatic remain in effect today more than a month after the official end of summer . we are in regular contact with  to find a solution but they constantly give us different excuses such as the increase in demand rising temperature etc deeb abdelghafour the pwas director of the water resources department told al jazeera . the notion that the region is suffering from water scarcity is a myth he added . we have been facing shortages for decades and the reason is not natural but manmade  meaning the israeli occupation and israeli control over water resources in the palestinian territories . israeli officials have stated that water resources are shared equally in israel and the occupied palestinian territories israels coordinator of government activities in the territories a unit in the israeli army noted that israel provides  million cubic metres of water to the palestinians annually even though it is only obliged to provide  million under the oslo accords . however disparity is evident in the lush gardens parks and swimming pools in illegal israeli settlements the key difference is that palestinian villages in the west bank are not connected to the national water grid relying instead on local underground supplies . palestinians living in remote areas have been hit the hardest by the ongoing water crisis as access roads are often poor and the additional costs of delivery result in higher prices . we need special  trucks to drive on the unpaved roads and it can take up to two hours to reach the communities said hafez hureini a resident of attuwani village and leader of the south hebron hills popular committee  shows her empty beehives last year we had bees so we could produce our own honey but all the bees died due to lack of water there are not enough flowers eloise bollackal jazeera . over the summer israeli media reported that illegal jewish settlements in the west bank were also suffering from daily disruptions to water supplies prompting the israeli government to establish a new drilling site ariel  which would provide  cubic metres of water per hour . abdelrahman tamimi director of the palestinian hydrology group for water and environmental resources development said that this was not where water was needed the most . the wells should be drilled where there is important demand such as north and south of jenin south of hebron or northwest of the jordan valley why in ariel i wonder as a hydrologist there is already a well there they can simply improve its capacity  this measure was definitely not designed to supply palestinian communities tamimi told al jazeera . in the meantime israel has accused palestinians of tapping into pipes with the israeli water authority asserting that  cubic metres of water is stolen every day by palestinians . we are aware there is water theft  however we should ask ourselves why are the people stealing water simply because they are thirsty abdelghafour said . at the same time increased water demands owing to growing israeli and palestinian populations is stretching the limits of existing water infrastructure most of the water network was installed in  when israel occupied the west bank today the diameters of the pipes are inadequate and the system is reaching the end of its life cycle . even to upgrade infrastructure in area a and b is a headache abdelghafour said they israel impose long and complicated procedures in order to issue permits to import the smallest pieces or equipment . data released by the israeli water authority shows that a large expansion in agriculture in the settlements has led to an estimated rise of  to  percent in water consumption this year . the palestinian authority has no solution for the water crisis in my opinion israel has used this summer to put more pressure on us to purchase desalinated water so they can allocate groundwater for the settlements and their future expansion tamimi said . since  five desalination plants have been built in israel now producing approximately  percent of the countrys water supply . we dont want to substitute water from desalination plants for our historical rights to all shared water resources abdelghafour said once we have our basic rights based on equitable allocation of resources and international law then we can think of other development options such as desalination or treatment of waste water the original source of this article is

negatively to s election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward . over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted  this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years . the rate on year treasury notes has surged to  from  before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade . blackrocks  called it a violent reaction . the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit . as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain . those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before . credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating . but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant  percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in   . the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit  percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since  was elected president . the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said  chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it . rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of  and many fear that it could happen again . and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market  . if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by  or  you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura . in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up  percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis . many  supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters . the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of  and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem . the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates . if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that  is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible . one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply   a  presidency might mean  has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc  . during his election campaign this year  spoke of a  percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times  a newspaper backed by the communist party . a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read . most  supporters assume that since  has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy . but it isnt that simple . the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates . the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point . so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep

same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top . the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit . lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less . then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this then after the pain of that to put

{"label": "hate", "text": "since we were children we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal hollywood movies disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond. i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all. another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates        while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates . romance was invented . it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel . the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings. the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows  source .  romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society  source . they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors  many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition. romantics redefined what relationships should be based on . prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings. passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used  source . besides song of songs in the old testament  writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce . women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen. the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers  source . the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love  which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship. . anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal. believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate  of divorces . romanticism and the rise of nationalism . if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake. one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning.  patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period  source . upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism  is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world  because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit. the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros  who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you. how should men choose their life partners . its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for. instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters. it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home. understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with. but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind. read more unconditional love from a woman is impossible"}

the twenties he used his position in congress occasionally to crusade against the federal reserve mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through defects of the law under which it operates through the maladministration of that law by the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it  louis t  june   . at one point  started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve not too surprisingly there were three attempts on s life one shooting and two poisonings the second of which was cuccessful although still officially declared as heart failure newspapers of the time reported  now that this sterling american patriot has made the passing it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of judah it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life the first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the capital hotels fortunately both shots missed him the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab . he became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at washington his life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the congressman to emergency treatment  john f   john f  . as president john f  understood the predatory nature of private central banking he understood why  fought so hard to end the second bank of the united states so  wrote and signed executive order  which ordered the us treasury to issue a new public currency the united states note . s united states note  click for larger . s united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for  to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f  was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed except for samples held by collectors . john j mccloy . . john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public s eo  has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since  . as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars . towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of  and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar part of the price demanded by roosevelt in exchange for the us entry into the war absent the economic advantages of being the worlds goto currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in  the bretton woods agreement ratified in  in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from overprinting the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at  per ounce . the bretton woods resort new hampshire . the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the s and s was the result of foreign nations obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of  an ounce then in  france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the  per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by  the imf estimated foreign central banks held  billion us dollars however the united states had only  billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august th  richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes . nixon announces the end of gold convertability . later termed the nixon shock this move effectively ended bretton woods and many global currencies started to delink from the us dollar . the nixon shock . worse since the united states had collateralized their loans with the nations gold reserves it quickly became apparent that the us government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the us and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the united states without some form of collateral so richard nixon started the environmental movement with the epa and its various programs such as wilderness zones roadless areas heritage rivers wetlands all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the american people who were technically the owners of those lands but nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt the plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much american land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the governments debts eventually almost  of the nation itself all of this is illegal as the enclave clause of the constitution limits the federal government to owning the land under federal government buildings and military bases and that enclave clause was written into the constitution by the founding fathers specifically to prevent the federal government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off pledge as collateral or rent . click for full size image . with open lands for collateral already in short supply the us government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar the united states approached the worlds oil producing nations mostly in the middle east and offered them a deal in exchange for only selling their oil for dollars the united states would guarantee the military safety of those oilrich nations the oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their us paper dollars inside the united states in particular in us treasury bonds redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of us taxpayers the concept was labeled the petrodollar in effect the us no longer able to back the dollar with gold was now backing it with oil other peoples oil and that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped americas foreign policy in the region ever since . but as americas manufacturing and agriculture has declined the oil producing nations faced a dilemma those piles of us federal reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the united states because the united states had little other than real estate anyone wanted to buy europes cars and aircraft were superior and less costly while experiments with gmo food crops led to nations refusing to buy us food exports israels constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the us could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use . saddam hussein and the lie of iraqs nuclear weapons . saddam hussein . iraq already hostile to the united states following desert storm demanded the right to sell their oil for euros in  and in  the united nations agreed to allow it under the oil for food program instituted following desert storm one year later the united states reinvaded iraq under the lie of saddams nuclear weapons lynched saddam hussein and placed iraqs oil back on the world market only for us dollars . the clear us policy shift following  away from being an impartial broker of peace in the mideast to one of unquestioned support for israels aggressions only further eroded confidence in the petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies . gaddafi and the gold dinar . gaddafi . over in libya muammar gaddafi had instituted a stateowned central bank and a value based trade currency the gold dinar . the gold dinar . gaddafi announced that libyas oil was for sale but only for the gold dinar other african nations seeing the rise of the gold dinar and the euro even as the us dollar continued its inflationdriven decline flocked to the new libyan currency for trade this move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call libya a threat to the financial security of the world so the united states invaded libya brutally murdered qaddafi  the object lesson of saddams lynching not being enough of a message apparently imposed a private central bank and returned libyas oil output to dollars only the gold that was to have been made into the gold dinars  tons of it is as of last report unaccounted for . update emails surfacing as part of the investigation into hilary clintons use of a private email server for classified information confirm that the real reason for the us invasion of libya was to destroy the threat of the gold dinar becoming a panafrican currency displacing the dollar . general wesley clark blows the whistle on us plans to conquer the oilrich middle east . according to general wesley clark the master plan for the dollarification of the worlds oil nations included seven targets iraq syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran venezuela which dared to sell their oil to china for the yuan is a late addition what is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the us is that none of them are members of the bank for international settlements the private central bankers private central bank located in switzerland this meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations economies rather than submit to the international private banks . update emails from secretary of state hillary clinton released as part of the benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on libya was to control the libyan oil reserves and to destroy libyas goldbacked currency . now the bankers gun sights are on iran which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose the war agenda is as always to force irans oil to be sold only for us dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank malaysia one of the few remaining nations without a rothschild central bank is now being invaded by a force claimed to be al qaeda and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets . with the death of president hugo chavez plans to impose a us and banker friendly regime on venezuela are clearly being implemented . so just where is the gold . germanys gold bullion where is it . the german government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the bank of france and the new york federal reserve france has said it will take  years to return germanys gold the united states has said they will need  years to return germanys gold this suggests strongly that the bank of france and the ny federal reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets and the central banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run so it is inevitable that suddenly france invades mali ostensibly to combat al qaeda with the us joining in mali just happens to be one of the worlds largest gold producers with gold accounting for  of mali exports war for the bankers does not get more obvious than that . mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the bank of england and along with venezuelas vast oil reserves larger than saudi arabia venezuelas gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the central banks that played fast and loose with other peoples gold bullion so we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon . can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage . a little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in december  a bank was moving to foreclose on a house and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value legally called the consideration in the case of first national bank of montgomery vs jerome daly  daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration the lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works they create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry which you must repay with your labor and there was no law in  that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that daly argued that because there was no equal consideration the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid the jury agreed so did judge mahoney who resisted demands to overrule the jury in favor of the bank and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself . judge mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later and the lawyer representing daly was debarred the decision in favor of daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten . you are brainwashed . you have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied the us claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands they havent the usual result of a us overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship such as the  cia overthrow of irans democratically elected government of mohammad mosaddegh and the imposition of the shah or the  cia overthrow of chiles democratically elected government of president salvador allende  and the imposition of augusto pinochet  or to save a people from a cruel oppressor revenge for  or that tired wornout catch all excuse for invasion weapons of mass destruction assassinations are always passed off as crazed lone nuts to obscure the real agenda . the real agenda is simple it is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation that obligation is false because the private central banking system by design always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt private central banking is not science it is a religion a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood meaning the owners of the private central bank the fraud persists with often lethal results because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of the same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement rule by divine right and slavery both systems built to trick people into obedience and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt or rule by private central bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest is equally illegitimate it only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be . but understand this above all private central banks do not exist to serve the people the community or the nation private central banks exist to serve their owners to make them rich beyond the dreams of midas and all for the cost of ink paper and the right bribe to the right official . behind all these wars all these assassinations the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship the private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks failing that said ruler will be killed and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks . the socalled clash of civilizations we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world no matter how many millions must die for it indeed the constant hatemongering against muslims lies in a simple fact like the ancient christians prior to the knights templars private banking system  muslims forbid usury or the lending of money at interest and that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted they refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest they refuse to be debt slaves . so off to war your children must go to spill their blood for the moneyjunkies gold we barely survived the last two world wars in the nuclearbioweapon age are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed . apparently so . this brings us to the current situation in the ukraine russia and china . the european union had been courting the government of the ukraine to merge with the eu and more to the point entangle their economy with the privateowned european central bank the government of the ukraine was considering the move but had made no commitments part of their concern lay with the conditions in other eu nations enslaved to the ecb notably cyprus greece spain and italy so they were properly cautious then russia stepped in with a better deal and the ukraine exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price dropped the eu and announced they were going to go with russias offer it was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the ukraine covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like canvas and usaid stirring up trouble while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on thenpresident yanukovich however a leaked recording of a phone call between the eus catherine ashton and estonias foreign minister urmas paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters not the ukrainian government urmas paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call . this is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before since the end of ww the us has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of  nations succeeding  times examples include the  overthrow of irans elected government of mohammed mossadegh and the imposition of the shah the  overthrow of chiles elected government of salvador allende and the imposition of the pinochet dictatorship and of course the current overthrow of ukraines elected government of yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government which is already gutting the ukraines wealth to hand to the western bankers . brazil russia india china and south africa have formed a parallel financial system called brics scheduled to officially launch on january   as of this writing some  nations are ready to trade with brics in transactions that do not involve the us dollar despite us economic warfare against both russia and china the ruble and yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the us dollar hence the us attempt to fan the ukraine crisis into war with russia and attempts to provoke north korea as a back door to war with china . click for larger image . flag waving and propaganda aside all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for the process is quite simple as soon as the private central bank issues its currency as a loan at interest the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt when the people are reluctant to borrow any more that is when the keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working when both the people and government refuse to borrow any more that is when wars are started to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war then after the war to borrow more to rebuild when the war is over the people have about the same as they did before the war except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century this is why brown brothers harriman in new york was funding the rise of adolf hitler . as long as private central banks are allowed to exist inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty hopelessness and millions of deaths in endless world wars until the earth itself is sacrificed in flames to mammon . the path to true peace on earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere and a return to the stateissued valuebased currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous banks do not have an obligation to promote the public good  alexander dielius ceo germany austrian eastern europe

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "schools all over america are closing on election day due to fears of violence all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything image credits flickr calibeach  . will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history . all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that  percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november th . many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  . several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail . the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students . if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention  the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town . and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state  told reporters  . there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state  cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning . all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything . let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that . another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  . we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  . and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats . early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats . republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library . i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat . in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  . well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  . according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group . the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches . either way it doesnt look good . after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines . but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters . its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic . without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier . but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  . if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking

{"label": "bs", "text": " shares.    . credit iosonounafotocamera  flickr. when the dust settled on the nov  election we learned that a completely unpredictable egomaniacal narcissistic buffoon would inherit the white house and the vast powers that go along with it this deeply offended many people who see s racist and misogynistic rhetoric as unpresidential liberal new york times columnist  summed up this view i respect the presidency i do not respect this presidentelect that the presidentelect should not be respected is a given but why should we respect the presidency. the imperial presidency of the united states has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial arguably the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war the constitution specifically reserves this right for congress the president as commanderinchief directs the wars that congress declares however starting with s intervention in the korean war in  and continuing with invasions of vietnam grenada iraq and afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries the presidents ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized congress has not declared war since  despite the fact the us military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world. in recent years george w  assumed the power to kidnap torture and assassinate any individual anywhere in the world at any time without even a pretense of due process upon replacing  barack   s kidnapping and torture by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will    has trashed the yearold magna carta which king  of england would have approved of. can there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will while american presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes pass legislation or incarcerate without charges inside us borders the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator. there has not been a single american president since world war ii that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the nuremberg trials. s executive order  to imprison japanese americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the fifth amendment right not to be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law. more  the cia has always served the interests of wall street  won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of  s firebombing of tokyo nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and invasion of korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the supreme law of the land per article vi of the us constitution. eisenhowers use of the cia to overthrow democratically elected presidents in iran and guatemala as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against cuba violated the un charter another international treaty that the constitution regards as the supreme law of the land. kennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade cuba as well as covert warfare in vietnam son massively escalated us military involvement in vietnam with the introduction of ground troops which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the gulf of tonkin incident. succeeding son nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only vietnam but cambodia and laos killing hundreds of thousands of people destroying ecosystems across indochina and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance  which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year. ford covertly supported the south african invasion of angola and overtly supported the indonesian invasion of east timor carter continued support of the indonesian occupation of east timor as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in guatemala and el salvador reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in nicaragua sponsored military dictatorships throughout central america and directly invaded grenada.  the elder invaded panama and iraq clinton oversaw sanctions in iraq that killed as many as  million people carried out an air war from  feet against serbia and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in sudan that produced medications for half the country  the lesser invaded and occupied afghanistan and iraq  continued both of those wars as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries. so i beg to differ with blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person. liberal clinton defender matt yglesias argues that from a historical perspective  is uniquely dangerous past presidents yglesias writes have simply been restrained by restraint  by a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do. it is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face as we have seen every single american president since at least wwii has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death destruction and misery across the world from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender. when  assumes the presidency he will inherit a frightening surveillancemilitaryincarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program a vast nsa domestic and international spying network a death squad the joint special operations command and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at guantanamo bay. partisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the wrong hands if  is at the helm liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an american citizen without charge or trial every now and then conservatives trusted  to warrantlessly surveill americans but were outraged at the snowden revelations. principled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority the handwringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a  presidency ring hollow and hypocritical. american presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve the occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power it is what dolores vek describes as actually existing fascism both parties have contributed to it the media has normalized it and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it its time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively delegitimizing it"}

dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive  said . message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the  administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack  in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless  has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister  disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral  felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it s intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the  administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for  to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the  era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines  would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient  can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the  era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against  he will humiliate  second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution  will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth"}

and cons of doing so like most people who come here i set off thinking i was going to live in paradise thats far from the reality let me tell you. living in south east asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else while i myself have decided to return west for a while ill always have a connection to asia and im sure ill be back many times throughout my life. so whats the real story with living in asia is it all its cracked up to be what does a man have to be aware of when coming here lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in south east asia and assess them in the light of reality.  asian women are kind gentle and compliant to their husbands so sweet not so fast. this is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakening. its definitely true that asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional they give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties. however the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs  pounds if you disrespect her. the idea that asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to western women is also nonsense while its not the norm ive met several western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their asian wives and girlfriends when you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen. asian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among them. read this guide to dating asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it.  asia is ridiculously cheap . this is one id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with. most things in asia are a lot cheaper eating out for my entire family often costs less than  meaning i can afford to do it basically every day my rent for a condo apartment costs less than  a month although thats mostly because i live in the sticks and am not in a major city. a general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like bangkok singapore and kl you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate. note this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price it certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments. asia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same life in south east asia can be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle.  you can become a citizen of an asian country and stay forever becoming a citizen in an asian country is nigh on impossible even if you could you probably wouldnt want to. you can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank however youll not become a citizen with all of the various rights they enjoy. its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them even if you live here for  years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals this has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group. youll get undue respect from some for being a westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter.  the weather in asia is  sunshine . the weather in south east asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type. the sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city. however when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside the rainfall and wind in many countries in south east asia is truly terrifying just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the philippines and youll see what its like. thankfully after  years of living in the philippines  ive never been caught directly in a major storm although ive seen the tail end of plenty of them. the weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad check this clip out to see how bad it can get. .  asia is  years behind the west in terms of development . this is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to. true countries like laos and bangladesh are miles behind any western nation but head to singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development. asia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country it wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the west although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now. theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees asian countries will catch up to and surpass the west quickly leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is india where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile. if you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale i salute you but i have to laugh there are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce them. on the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities. .  asians are extremely family oriented again this is one i lean towards agreeing with there are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in asia especially countries like the philippines. i dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case  of the asian people i have ever met and gotten to know from indonesia to the philippines to thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most western countries. i pass no judgment on this whatsoever it can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective i personally like it and think its something weve lost in many european countries and america too. this is an idea about asia i agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an asian woman be prepared for this. the family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most asian countries. living in asia summary sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in south east asia. what you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which i do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story. i came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade however ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home. id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in asia do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different view. read more why western men prefer foreign women over their own"}

{"label": "bias", "text": "by rmuse    am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina   the following is an opinion column by  . some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded  projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent  republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of  in  and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet  accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath . yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state  what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state  . the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable  . most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward  sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error  . mr  is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last  elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue  testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr  said .  if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted  . it is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years . according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final  days before an election  republican election officials state officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tensofthousands  of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis . however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters?the majority who are them democrats ?in beaufort county . in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of  mostly democratic voters  in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately  mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans . the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican  election rigging  conspiracy .  we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties  ms hair also noted that  in moore county the return address of a rightwing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters  she said it is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by republicans . the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said .  we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution  . the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since  using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case . it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years . last thursday us district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters . republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected  as president and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress or obstruct the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression obstruction or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec who are behind each and every attempt in republicancontrolled

here referred to as system is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power does this tool work in the us model certainly  the relation between the system and its social base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies because of that sustained regularity system and base acted in convergent patterns of dependency in historical perspective it was not possible for the system to transform those colonies into states and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion from that time onward an ideological symbiosis ran between the system and the base not only that but each time the system modifies direction philosophy or ideology the base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception. the patterns of ideological association between the us system and its social base extended into modern times and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections if you look at voters turnout since   you will notice that a relativetolarge majority of americans had voted in those elections my interpretation of the vote in relation to s thesis is the following voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies crimes around the world overthrowing foreign governments not in line with washington and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing voting for that system while knowing its attributes policies and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology culture and violence. more zionism is racism zionism goes from bad to worse taking judaism with it how modern is israel green party of canada calls to revoke jewish national fund charitable status caveat that does not necessarily mean that all voters share the systems imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples the pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the systems foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the base resides in two concepts discarding immediately the notion that the base has been cohabitated by the system the first concept has it that the base has given a mandate to the system to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars a dichotomy sets in here the system has its way of life and the base has its own the second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism meaning if the system could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations.  a question would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of active sharing in the policies of the system this subject is open for debate   . the relation between the american system and its base was uniform up to a certain point in history late s until that point the american state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status that uniformity however managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged to be exact despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the base and government as well as the composition of the latter the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was  not open for challenge and  shaped by an exclusive american anglosaxon experience. but when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system that was the first time in us history where the powerful american imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project with that a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the us power the rest is history as a result the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the united states coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the us power the dominant american system itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsamerican jewish zionists. when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system. as a group american jewish zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment they possess efficient organizational structures have a monolithic political presence across the american system and they know how to finance their activities with us tax money i must note that their alignment with the global agenda of us imperialism is a twopoint expedient the first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of americas interests the second is tactical to reap on behalf of israel the benefits of alignment with slogans such as israel is our only trusted ally in the middle east. the american jewish zionist experience is agenda driven as such their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other jewishrelated consideration. on the domestic front the focus could not be more evident to consolidate zionism and turn it into a means to  perpetuate israel as an american national issue and  make of them the principal factor in defining american politics you can notice the endeavor clearly during us elections when the zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the jews and for israel today voicing dissent against the policies of american jewish zionism or criticizing israel amounts to crime  experienced this firsthand when he published his book palestine peace not apartheid  american jewish zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him. as for the jewish zionist foreign agenda this is clearcut and leaves no space for misunderstanding it aims to induce control or lead the united states to  adopt hostile policies toward the arab nations because due to their rejection of the zionist state and  undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to israel equally important it demands that the united states keep denying the palestinians rights for nationhood through american diplomacy what is the rationale recognition of the palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the zionist state and its claim on palestine. because the jewish zionist control of the us system is real and dominant how does the american society figure visÃ vis this dominance based on observations of the american society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns there can be but one answer zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the american people it is however the dominant culture and ideology of the us political system. observations. first despite gargantuan zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the american people jewish zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for zionist issues and for israel. second due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues a majority of americans have only vague ideas on what zionism is. third to establish roots for their political dominance jewish zionist activists invariably focus not on the american people but on ways to control the american system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter white house and congress. fourth this control did not happen because of elections it is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing jewish zionists to important positions inside the administrations. fifth among the stratagems employed by zionists when they run for elective offices one was particularly effective take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election to do that jewish zionist candidates rarely if ever talk about israel or zionism instead they only debate matters of interest to the voters once elected though promoting israel via american legislations becomes the top hidden agenda. sixth and to conclude this particular argument the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of jewish zionists thus indirectly to israel in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culturezionism. another point to discuss is the expansion of the jewish zionist power by all accounts such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process in his book the arabists the romance of an american elite  robert d kaplan defined the issue that i framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy kaplan was unambiguous he called these new elites by their names irishamericans and jewishamericans. kaplans viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion he argued that the old elites approached the usarab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog all while keeping an eye on the us imperialist interests his argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion the two groups of postwwii american society that kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of us foreign policy it is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward arabs and muslimseach for his own set of religious political and ideological rationales as for the successive shares of africanamericans and hispanics in the making of the national policy of the united states this is another argument. as a witness to history in early  i began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of american jewish zionists in the making of us policies and wars in the arab world in may of that year as my work became broad in scope i decided to seek more views on the subject i came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where i pose the same questions while some of the prospective interviewees declined and others accepted but then withdrew three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge scholarship and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views. they are francis boyle a professor of international law university of illinois college of law james petras a professor emeritus university of binghamton new york canadian writer and former coeditor of the online publication of dissident voice kim petersen professors boyle and petras answered my questions via phone conversations and petersen via email correspondence. however in the weeks following the interviews my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing in short i was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned today as i thank prof francis boyle prof james petras and kim petersen for sharing their invaluable insight i apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read. introduction. the turning point in the emergence of jewish zionism as a dominant american political force came about when iraq invaded kuwait discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction the jewish zionist establishment seized the occasion mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against iraq to bring their war mania to fruition they unleashed their experts in all directions they talked about iraqs formidable military capabilities and about saddams onemillionman standing army ready to invade saudi arabia and seize its oil they told stories about saddam husseins personal life his bunkers and his mortal nuclear threats to israel and they talked about iraqs threats to us interests and allies in the middle east    here is a brief account of those events. on july   iraqi president saddam hussein met with us ambassador to iraq april glaspie it is on record that glaspie gave hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve iraqs problems with kuwait militarily on august  iraq invaded kuwait on august  george h w bush ordered the freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and immediately placed iraq under hermetic embargo considering the prompt extraordinary antiiraq measures that the united states took in the first  hours of that invasion one wonders what was pushing the us to move so quickly on iraq knowing that only two days earlier this was conducting a us proxy against iran the observation that the us did not take similar actions when iraq invaded iran in  or when israel invaded lebanon in  raises many questions what were the us rationales in taking such measures who conceived them did the us entrap iraq why   . the atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic like a lightning bolt us imperialist and zionist forces instantly mobilized their media talking heads retired generals and bogus experts on the middle east the deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by iraq in kuwait hid a definite scheme incite for war  in the period august    january   israelis and jewish zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war on january   a member coalition in which the us had the lion shareninetyseven percent of the total forceattacked iraq by every standard and minutia of details the war on iraq in  was an american war . at the end of a war that destroyed one of israels arab adversaries george h w bush might have thought of himself as americas laureate hero he did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the us loan guaranties to israel would have unleashed the jewish zionist establishment against him the fact that he lost to bill clinton who opposed bushs freeze and who stated that israel was the only country that paid back its debts indicated that american jewish zionists had finally reached their objective to perfect ways to control the us politics from the inside  in retrospect it can be said that george h w bush was the last nonzionist american president from bill clinton forward us presidents and their vice president became pawns in the jewish zionist play of power. now as the united states was preparing for war with iraq to liberate kuwait thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it but no one could have ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words about how american jewish zionists and israel were pushing for that war he said there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east  the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner   with that buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head am rosenthal a ringleader of us zionist journalism could not bear what he heard in a rebuttal he unleashed an acerbic attack against buchanan his weapon of argument so to speak was the stale and trite accusation of antisemitism. whining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words and went on to imply that buchanan was in effect engaging in an antijewish tirade he reinterpreted buchanans words and cast them in a standard zionistic fashion he wrote that buchanans intention was the jews are trying to drag us into war only jews want war israeli jews want war to save israels hide american jews who talk of military action against iraq want war because it would suit israeli interests they are willing to spill american blood for israeli interests . by inserting the word jew in his reply rosenthal and the new york times behind him spat on the face of us political reality under the tight grip of zionism we need not waste our breath on rosenthals petty tactic his clear objective was to distract from the central issue which is buchanans opposition to the planned war against iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity. still buchanan was honest he pointed the finger to israel and its amen corner because that was the truth the fact that most israelis and amen corners happened to be of jewish faith was nonissue to conclude it is evident that buchanan a dreamer of an american republic not empire could not stand by idle while seeing the united states sheepishly fastened to the yoke of zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state israel. buchanan did not stop there truthful and resolute he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the us congress visÃ vis israel and american jewish zionists he dubbed it as an israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly american politicians would dare not think let alone say notice that buchanan had placed israel before its us amen corner i view this as a statement he clearly implied that israel is the primary decision maker did that also imply that us zionist groups amen corner are puppets moved by israel most likely if so which has more power in setting the us world agenda and policies israel or american jewish zionists dialectically the answer should be israel by means of its amen corner. now in december  jim lehrer a former coanchor of the macneillehrer newshour and later sole anchor of the newshour with jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan it is important to mention that jim lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over  years starting in  is that an issue yes and to debate it the following applies whenever a specific group of people be they christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps an important public post for such a long duration the implication is unescapable the group controls that post because of its embedded importance    but more important they have the power to keep it. nonetheless when a specific group continues to hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies and branches of the us government a paradigm emerges either the group controls said corporations directlythat is why it is able to do what they want or it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees at any rate considering this type of control the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable. additionally the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect it means that someone within the context of us imperialism has decided that the us public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns in these patterns issues such as israel zionism palestine us imperialism in the middle east wars etc are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter. before continuing i must state that lehrers political views are not a subject to discuss visÃ vis his program for one the newshour program is not about the personal views of presentersit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation second whether lehrer had sympathies for israel or zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them nevertheless a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated newscomments the people who deliver them and the people who hear them. firstly planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses to be sure these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries still the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict they also know they can seep to the viewers preconceived ideas through pleasant dialogs affable manners appearance of neutrality and clever circumlocutions. to be fair to lehrer he was consistent in making intelligent questions however he was also consistent at doing something else he would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed it is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the zionist and imperialist discourse in essence a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation. now in his interview lehrer played dumb when he asked buchanan about his bold characterization of the congress he phrased his question as follows you have also said that congress is an israelioccupied territory now what do you mean by that  italics are mine. comment semantically as much as politically buchanans figure of speech was terse and unequivocal he plainly meant that the congress observes israels agenda and acts accordingly there was no need for buchanan to say anything further because what he said had and still has basis in verifiable facts with a question such as what do you mean by that lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from buchanan the form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap buchanan make him retract or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency in essence lehrer had simply tried to deny that israel controls the congress through its amen corner because his what do you mean indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation . to wrap up the issue without exclusion any denial of the jewish zionist control of the united states is a farce take abraham h foxman of the infamous antidefamation league as an example foxman authored a masterdeceptive propaganda book that he called  the deadliest lies  the israeli lobby and the myth of jewish control italics are mine first foxman lied he knew very well that the jewish zionist control is not a myth but a pervasive reality second but most important the problem is not the abstract jewish control but the specificjewish zionist control this can be explained using a current universal truth hundreds of thousands of jews from all nationalities actively oppose zionism on political religious ethical historical and ideological grounds. foxmans denial means one of two things either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of american jewish zionism or he is very ignorant of the history of zionism  which is impossible either way foxmans business is propaganda demagogy and deception incidentally foxmans denial looks very similar to what some arabs do in the middle east villagersbut even some city folkstry to fend off envy by following an eonold superstition they fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center it appears that foxman and his associates have their own superstition by decrying the deadliest lies against american jewish zionists they try to fend off the accusation or the envy that jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power and influence. of substance did foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what john foster dulles told william knowland a prozionist senator from california back in february  in an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get israel out of egyptian territory occupied by israel in the suez war dulles pronounced these prophetic words we cannot have all our policies made in jerusalem     that was in  today all those who deride or deny the charge that israel has a say on us foreign policy and wars in the middle east must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying. interestingly years after buchanan made that statement the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity two people vindicated his characterization of capitol hills as an israelioccupied territory and both used his words to make the point the first is a former cia officer philip giraldi and the second is philip weiss founder of mondoweiss website in an article he wrote in  giraldi pointed to the congress as  its still occupied territory  weiss titled a piece he wrote in  as such  capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory . at this point do american jewish zionists control the united states do they control it as polity or only the political system do they have real influence in setting us foreign policy and wars against the arab and muslim nations or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations. next. part  discussion. part  interview with francis boyle. part

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites. . to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power. the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule. the diversion . when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere. on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous  case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america. but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by  and others to stir up unrests across america. did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies. the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order. the strategy . back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites. the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible. my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them. thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street. as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win. a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists. first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa . second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control. no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future. the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction . the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites. on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape. on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites. so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind. conclusion is there still hope . although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class. with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters. i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny. read more the elites have one rule for themselves and one rule

{"label": "bs", "text": "we all remember the lies that led the us into the iraq war . but after years of media indoctrination its easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of iraq .   there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may??and i emphasize may??have come from iraq .   oh is that right .   if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made . source  and the anthrax scare    higher quality clip . when iraq finally admitted having these weapons in  the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount  this is just about the amount of a teaspoon  less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the united states senate in the fall of  this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope . iraq declared  liters of anthrax but unscom estimates that  could have produced  liters if concentrated into this dry form this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons and  has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonfull of this deadly material . source s presentation to the un on iraq wmd    . although it is difficult to remember at this point the anthrax scare of late  was widely seen as a followup to the  attacks and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the socalled war on terror beginning in late september and continuing for several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two us senators killing five and injuring  . it did not take long however for the neocons in the  administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen  and osama  . in his book  the  anthrax deception  dr  describes this as the double perpetrator hypothesis an attempt to blame the attacks on both  and iraq he writes . what i call the double perpetrator hypothesis held that s group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores namely iraq . this hypothesis insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently . macqueen well the young woman who opened senator daschles mailafghanistan and iraq    . the story of iraqi collusion with  sounded credible enough to an american public that had no familiarity with the muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of  the only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie . when key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite a signature of the iraqi anthrax program the  administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between saddam and the attacks . as filmmaker robbie martin explains in his documentary american anthrax  however that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media . martin points to disgraced exnew york times journalist and iraqi wmd pusher judy miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie iraq to the anthrax letters . as we now know of course the anthrax attacks were a false flag event . by early  it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases at fort detrick a key facility within americas own bioweapons program soon suspicion fell on steven hatfill a person of interest identified by the fbi who eventually won a  million lawsuit against the department of justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press the blame for the attacks was then pinned on bruce ivins a researcher at fort detrick who conveniently died before the fbi could identify him or try him in court the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office have both cast doubt on the fbis scientific investigation of the attacks however and a whistleblower within the fbis own investigation has revealed that the bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate ivins . whoever the perpetrator may have beeneven accepting that ivins was the attackerit is a fact that the attacks were a false flag using crudely forged letters to convince the american public that they were written by  agents and that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in iraq . the legacy of that war remains with us today the middle east including iraq itself remains in chaos a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country an invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications . the blood of a million dead iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war and those who aided and abetted those liars . meanwhile the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression"}

the democratic national committee  shares.    . an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make   our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life   is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will. to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general. who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are  and bill  whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe s primal financial benefactors and firstname friends fein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite . candidate s relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status. this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research . more a new email investigation on  could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of   exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin. instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy. yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery. the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms. perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch. a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill s bushs and obamas in the  administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies. smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill  administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money. for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite. two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying. the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes. your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions   has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising. undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic. the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the  campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two. the firstandmost strategy worked secretary  preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the  campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum. to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games. this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed. not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated s superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced s presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval . no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the  campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence. enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and s paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the  campaign

broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the  foundation hosts pay to play the s personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco. finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude. once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered  overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary  at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here . then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary and no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to  and denied sanders accordingly. that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then  s nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy. but the corporate elite will not be denied given the dnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed. the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the dnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception   promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it. but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting   is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust. here now we need to be vigilant. endnotes.  see testing theories of american politics elites interest groups and average citizens by martin gillens and benjamin page they conclude economic

of arbitration namely for having expressed his viewpoints on israeli crimes calling for an open debate on the holocaust and  despite being promoted to a full professor rank through a process of peer review in an exclusive interview with r professor  elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the west.  has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it. i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian  as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there. for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada. in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  . more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism. the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic. in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law. i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present. it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me. due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century. my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action. i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure. the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions.  believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university. i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations. unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally. as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg. my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals. in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic. as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law. this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy. for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries. in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards. a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonnÃ© dieudonnÃ© was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days. one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication. there is a controversial quote from  in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia. i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor. this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse"}

the past eight years in this article i am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering anyone that takes a cold hard honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape unfortunately the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views up until the election democrats were far more likely then republicans to believe that the economy was improving but now that is in the process of completely reversing according to gallup  only  percent of republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election but that number has suddenly jumped to  percent after s election victory and the percentage of democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from  percent to  percent after the election here are some additional details from gallup  . after  won last weeks election republicans and republicanleaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the us economys outlook than they did   just  of republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election while  said it was getting worse since the election  say it is getting better and  worse . conversely democrats and democraticleaning independents confidence in the economy plummeted after the election before the election  of democrats said the economy was getting better and  worse now democrats are evenly divided with  saying it is getting better and  saying it is getting worse . the truth of course is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the us economy . we still have a giant mess on our hands and the following are  very depressing economic realities that  will inherit from  .  nearly  out of every  americans have less than  in savings  that means that about twothirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment .  reuters is reporting that us mall investors are poised to lose billions of dollars as the  retail apocalypse  in this nation deepens .  credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since   .  approximately  percent of all americans have a debt that is at least  days past due .  the rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a  year low  .  the total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost  million  .  the number of homeless people in new york city where  is from has hit a brand new record high  .  about  percent of all young adults are currently

waltz in and suddenly turn everything around . just like when george w bush was elected there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among republicans . and in  republicans are going to have control of the senate and the house in addition to being in control of the white house . but does that mean that they will actually get anything done . for a moment lets review what didnt happen the last time the republicans were in this position the following is an extended excerpt from an article by author devvy kidd   the republicans had control of both houses of congress part of the time during bush jrs two terms did they lock down our borders no did they pass legislation to stop all funding for illegals which would selfdeport millions of liars cheats and thieves no read please how to selfdeport millions of illegals  did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending no did they get rid of any of clintons unconstitutional executive orders one or two but otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap in our faces did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department of education and epa no did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid no did they stop unconstitutional spending for planned parenthood no congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change no  the left just lost the war on climate change did bush jr get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing american jobs no did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when american workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line no did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling americas businesses no did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty no a republican controlled congress with a republican in the white house and they did virtually nothing to restore america to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending  . so will things be any different under a  administration . we shall see . there will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the shortterm . a great example of this is the national debt as i discussed yesterday  the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country     federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes our ridiculous debt  would begin collapsing immediately . we consume far more wealth than we produce and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money . either  will continue to borrow money recklessly or we will go into a major league economic downturn . it really is that simple . but when our politicians borrow money they are literally destroying the future of this country so the choice is pain in the shortterm or greater pain in the longterm . there is a way out and that would involve shutting down the federal reserve and going to a completely debtfree form of money but that is a topic for another article . and unfortunately that is not something that is even on s radar at this point . no matter who won the election the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities . there are many out there that have faith that  can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle but there are others that are deeply skeptical . let us hope for the best but let us also keep preparing for the worst"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "what would you do if you saw two boys of  years wrestling their shirts off red and sweaty they have a large group of peers around them cheering eyes wide and knuckles white would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life the answer you give is in large part dependent on your gender so the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization but nil desperandum  western civilization has the solution. mere horseplay. as an early years professional i saw education academics acknowledging the databoys need rough and tumble play for their mental and physical wellbeing but they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making fingerpistols at each other without saying it directly they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys natural urge to fight like cubs underground whats more the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature. their solution they suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them until the late s education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors but of course there has been no effort to bring back that environment instead a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achievedplaying superheroes. as though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other the treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pickaxe of nthwave feminism at it so its high time we took a few swings back. but first we need to teach our lads how to fight at the age of  or  viking children were taught the martial art of glima this was not just father and son playfighting boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age this was more systematic a group activity. the greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture the hoplites for example were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the persian empire yet today even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by sjws nevertheless all the signs are thereour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers. . at college i started a unofficial fight clubmen only this based in large part on the book and movie of the same name in which the narrators nietzschean alter ego tyler durden describes the bubbling frustration inside the everincreasing number of somethings coming together for underground fights were a generation of men raised by women naturally half the guys in my year were participating within a week but our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some massshootings by angry loner teens when they are young it is the perfect time to teach them. young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends its just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in selfdefence and the defence of ones community furthermore a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships meaning less bullying and segregation it is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient greek wrestling etc with those we intuit as wrestling children. no intentional hitting or kicking no gouging the eyes or biting no going for the balls thats precisely how i used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup it was just obvious if someone took things too far they were ostracised from the fun at least until they calmed down and apologised if someone got hurt we stopped checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended we kept calm and carried on. were a generation of men raised by women  tyler durden. the data are screaming that men havent changed especially our need to practise fighting we still have the same natural impulses but their suppression no their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive so much so many are selfdeprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic full of white guilt and ashamed of western civilization we have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys fighting spirit so they grow some balls some confidence in themselves and their kin thats the spirit which has kept our enemies foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural marxism malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go if we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second we need to organise some fights not break them up. read more a short history on the masculinity of fighting . save . save . save"}

federal government has been corrupted probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe democrats the best example of this was the behavior of fbi director  the fbi is part of the executive branch of government so    who in turn   despite this fact one expects that the fbi be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to after all the us was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law. s actions reveal that the fbi has thrown equality before the law out the window at first the fbi investigated s use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was secretary of state but even though  apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences   her back in july with a hand slap. in a move that surprised everyone  reopened on october th the criminal investigation of  after  emails state department emails were found on pervert    supporters rejoiced and  supporters expressed outrage but the white house calmly called  a man of integrity did they know something we didnt. it turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just  hours before election day    again  the fbi director likely intended to clear  of wrongdoing before the election to defuse donald s criticism of her. the big lesson is that the law is applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed. the elites are in control but elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the great oz. ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees by controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle the good news is that their control is not complete they are not omnipotent. the weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways the first was with the brexit vote when prime minister  agreed to hold a referendum on the uks membership in the eu he never dreamed that britons would actually vote to leave all the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames still through the work of men like nigel farage and boris johnson the british populace voted to leave the eu the brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win. the second way was the campaign of  himself the gop had planned a coronation for jeb bush the rest of the gop field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from jeb  came in with an uncompromising message and crushed jeb and the rest of the little jebs the elite plan to have  versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by s campaign even if  has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the great oz we see the globalists behind the curtain. the third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the alt right a tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the us now we have grandmothers in texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists. the overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite they exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us with sound strategy they can be defeated. the elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites . in the past europe had an aristocracy this aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country the aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war they also had the same religion as the rest of the country we already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to wikileaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion. wikileaks revealed that   and her campaign manager are close friends with marina abramovic a serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated it also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain. while spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has be a sort of initiation ritual into the us globalist elite   john podesta jayz and beyonce lady gaga and gwen stefani have all attended these rituals and i would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians ceos and bankers also participate getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the us there are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day european elites. there are several things at work here most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual it is more like a college fraternity initiation it only means something in terms of ones social standing also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses. in both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us they dont share the same destiny as us if the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused and they even lack a common morality with us in their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us. the fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them the aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen the modern elite lack this wisdom once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal. conclusion with s election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated however the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning in any case we can be grateful that the election of  has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society. read more rigged fbi reveals it has evidence   broke law but will not prosecute"}

new book the left in power  to  reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of s conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features s introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author . every year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of  on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list . s latest book the left in power  to   is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as  reveals even during the  years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy  and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed s second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis . the immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with  gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis .  outlines this narrative faulting the  administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the  administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the  administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic . on the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack   the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house . at least in the propaganda use of  the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as  outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges  reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack  and hillary  the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also  argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and care architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly . the left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically  provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and  has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left . the left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce . in the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary  . in chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary  .  latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people  included unworthy of serious consideration or respect . silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far  keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year . lets hope that some of americas young will read  booksand learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them"}

this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest . back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement . as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future  campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away s strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a  primary campaign

with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife

democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective . this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us . overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and

organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests . it still remains to be seen if s stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen . certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new  presidency . but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that

wanttoknowinfoformer white house interpreter and whistleblowersilencing whistleblowersby why dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations if these activities are so illegal why are people not coming forward to report themover the last fifty years us government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee including his or her family who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operationsas a condition of employment military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement or nondisclosure agreement before being given access to the position which offers high pay and status in the organization this agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals any information regarding the program thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job all employees eagerly sign itthis secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technologyhowever because of the binding power of the agreement government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations it was the perfect tool to threaten silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of governmenttoday the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement these penalties include huge fines termination financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families most will not reveal any wrongdoing no matter how egregious for fear of calculated severe retributionwhen employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial or to sue the agency that hired them if they try to do so as a whistle blower they find they have no right to be heard in federal court many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late that is part of the systemif the employee attempts to contact their congressman or senator their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case because they do not have the necessary clearancewhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the congressional intelligence committees their response is ignored it is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases so they refer them back to their senator or congressman who cannot access information involved in their caseif a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle a system of personal and career destruction follows this begins with promotions being denied being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments and their files being flagged ruining their reputation inside their agency at this point their career is over if they go quietly the retribution stopswhen the employee still continues their effort to report the information their travel records personnel records medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information if no substantive information can be found it is fabricated and placed in their fileemployees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations multiple hostile interviews attempting to get them to recant their information and multiple polygraph interrogationsin many cases the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation if they comply the evaluation labels them as paranoid unstable or disgruntled this information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutinyif the employee contacts a member of the news media they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them several news media outlets are connected to the cia and nsa and notify them of the employees contactfinally the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against themafter termination or forced resignation interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable the release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony the agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors further ruining them financiallydehumanized financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure the employees family begins to break apart if the familys foundation is not strong this results in alcoholism depression and divorce in some cases it has resulted in the employee committing suicide the ultimate goal of the program of destruction this silences the employee permanently obscuring the agencys role in their destruction it is the perfect crimeshould the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity classified agencies will invoke the secretive state secrets privilege which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison if the familys case reaches federal court the state secrets privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case factsnow that the employees case and in some cases their familys case is shut down and under seal citing national security the process of silencing the employee is complete many are never heard from again fearing prison if they talk to anyone including an attorneyusing attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts the us government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements this includes employees at all levels from secretaries to ceos once they have signed the secrecy agreement they are bound to keep all information including potentially illegal information quiet being threatened with the same penaltiesto date over five million americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the state secrets privilegeonly a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed sadly some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicideemployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it even to expose corruption most look the other way to protect their careers retirements and families many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists but they are not fully aware of all that is being done the full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees until its use is necessarythis is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen this system has been used and perfected for over fifty years it is being used because it worksit works unless the system is exposed the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in governmentthis support is essential not only to protect the whistle blower and their family but also to defend our constitutional form of government from tyrannykevin m video httpsyoutubenlnwkcmt logged the two enemies of the people are criminals and

{"label": "bs", "text": "by m s ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why  won the election mr s   won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised whites who were sick to death of the neoconservative liberal elites as typified by the loathsome  it is in s own interests s believes not to betray the whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises there must be no uturns no cuddling up to the zionist enemy no wishywashy compromises or backslidings  is now expected to make america great again  or else a tall order well see ld .  in certain times there is a surreal feeling of being a part of history which is perhaps to say we are living in a time period of dynamic change however unthinkable for the left it may be  has been elected we can add this to brexit and other unthinkable events to come to contemplate the details of what this may entail such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities  which do indeed include building that wall has something of a christmas morning feelingeveryday . to paraphrase an from die welt  in western democracies the status quo seems stable and it is not generally considered possible for extremes to transpire but that is what we have seen however we may want to quibble about what exactly is extreme can donald  or the altright for that matter be considered extreme after that electoral show of consent regardless when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying uncourageous republicans and the frankly antiwhite agenda of the democrats extreme does not carry such a negative connotation but instead implies a kind of deliverance . we have been locked in a middleclass complaisance and that is precisely why societies such as ours are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious and alas though it may be unspeakable to liberals and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media  is now the most powerful man in the world as die welt puts it perhaps with some apprehension just let that sink in explanatory factors . s appeal may have been equally a reaction to black lives matter protests as to immigration according to exit polls  percent of  voters feel that blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to black lives matter overall half of white voters democrats and republicans opined that blacks are treated fairly by police likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our nonaltright family members and acquaintances were not amused by black lives matter  voters were especially unamused . of  supporters  percent favor building the wall on the southern border compared to less than half of all voters  percent oppose  percent favor so antipathy towards both black lives matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted  to the presidency  in part by turning off mainstream middleclass white people who are normally content with the statusquo moderates may not want a wall per se  but they also may not complain too loudly when its being built and again s actual voters want it builtunequivocally . while losing some steam amongst collegeeducated whites  won the white working class by  points  an increase from romneys  point spread ultimately there is no simple narrative that emerges  increased white support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college i wont pretend to be nate silver so lets just say he won because of white people . among his supporters opines thomas friedman on real time with bill maher  this was  percent about race and the other  percent was about race . good then lets accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions if  triumphed on the basis of race issues he now has a mandate on immigration law and order the wall etc . for the nytimes david brooks holding forth on public broadcasting service pbs  voters are just going with their gene pool  a rather bald statement that  voters are voting their ethnic interests after the election brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions with one faction advocating ethnic separatism what many on the alt right are already advocating would that it were so . nixon became known to history as the law and order candidate which accurately characterized his proclivities visÃ vis crime  on the other hand to leave no doubt selfidentified as the law and order candidate as liberals will complain and as the altright will readily admit law and order is understood to mean that we will not tolerate black violence and civil unrest s support therefore was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked once again from blacks and other malcontent minorities in the protests following his victory which continue as i write this . it is ironic that blacks report feeling scared at the prospect of the  presidency while they are in fact the progenitors of violence and so far as i know  never made any negative statements explicitly about blacks their violence and disorder has indeed scared the rest of civil society contributing to s election perhaps blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent whites in this inverted reality how can we assuage these sensitive blacks sense of fear shall we become human punching bags you cant always get what you want . if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory . some journalists noted with amusement that  often played the rolling stones you cant always get what you want at his campaign rallies i hypothesized that  liked the song for its beautiful choral section which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters second choice but now it all makes sense i suggest that for our underprivileged people of color its time you learned you cant always get what you want . not only is the people of color poc attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous it is also presumptuous . while the msm claims that the onus is now on  to reach out to those who didnt vote for him ie blacks and hispanics it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him  it follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the oval office sourced from the occidental observer like this share it now  thoughts on   won because of white people  gyÃ¶rgy says november   at  am . you cant always get what you want . if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory . problem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability people are people for example employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed an assumption is made on the governments part that an employer will unfairly select anglo saxon over other races which is wrong therefore the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality . this is a form of dictating morality by an amoral government this is one area that mr  ought to

amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium . after the ovation he received on entering  quipped hey look at this a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come he continued before i begin i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful terrible  people that youre sensitive and that you want to signal your virtue so ive brought along these safety pins holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper .  then held up a diaper prompting huge laughs from the audience . when a protester yelled at  that he should be wearing a swastika  held out his yarmulke then fired back in case you hadnt noticed the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type .  continued stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for  is a vicious racist its your right to protest of course but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  donald  doesnt care about your protest donald  is sitting somewhere in  tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty salty tears . referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending s lecture  opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture and by the way im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben  with all due respect f you right back gang . after the applause subsided and  joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him the real fun began protesters stood up chanting shame over and over again .  quipped wow its like game of thrones  should i get undressed and walk down the aisle . the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters  addressed the protesters saying im happy to talk with you but they responded by screaming safety over and over  joked did somebody fart the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting usa .  replied i tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold he added you see this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety and youre perfectly safe look at that its amazing that provoked sustained applause . when the protesters started screaming shame again  eviscerated them pointing out if youre going to pick a chant like shame watch game of thrones first the bad guys shout shame the audience loved that line on a roll  continued youre not changing anybodys mind all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq if it were channeled into electricity night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly . he continued okay can we talk now or are you going to keep shouting nows your chance to get it out lets hear your feelings cmon just go for it or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer . when the protesters resumed chanting  responded if you guys want to talk we can talk if you want to shout get the hell out more applause .  fired for gods sake at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended .  returned to deconstructing the term social justice when the protesters started again a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and  too he added see thats what a decent hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime presumably .  returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength he turned to the protesters remember that decency . the protesters screamed back shame  fired back decency the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined  in chanting decency shutting the protesters up . as  spoke of the falsity of white privilege the protesters formed a line in front of  prompting him to quip if you guys are all going to come up here can we all just have circle time or something . the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half but then the crowd started yelling back free speech matters  turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters morons that again prompted cheering . one member of the audience yelled to the protesters at least tell us what you want or otherwise just get out that brought a sustained ovation . after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue the protesters started shouting safety again then filed out yelling f white supremacy while flipping off  and the entire audience that prompted the crowd to sing nananana nananana hey hey goodbye it also promoted this from  . even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door . after  explained why the protesters had not been arrested as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event he continued all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event . even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door prompting  to quip doesnt this school give homework does anybody have a job around here i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands .  noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters who accused him of being a white supremacist when he asked her why she thought so she replied that she got that impression from his image he fired back really was it the yarmulke that did it for you . he took another shot at the protesters during the speech noting that people were born unequal and adding some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters . the rest of the speech was vintage  as was the qa afterward even the chalk was impressive . went back to the

{"label": "hate", "text": "home  be the change  government corruption  prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to  prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to  the free thought project november    comment . rt  people trust the unbiased internet search giant google so much it can actually influence up to  million undecided voters to choose hillary  for president prominent us psychologist and author  told rt following years of research . despite being a supporter of the democratic presidential nominee dr  believes googles unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a threat to democracy . rt  how did you discover that google is possibly in cahoots with the  campaign . re well i didnt find out that they were necessarily supporting hillary  thats not what i found at first first through several years of research i found that they had the power to control elections the power to shift the votes so that was more than four years of experimental research with more than  people in  countries . so we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings google can shift a lot of votes more than  percent of undecided voters overall and in some demographic groups up to  percent of undecided voters people trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples votes . now more recently many people have established that google has a very close relationship with hillary  that didnt come from my research that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people . rt are you going to take a look at facebook and twitter as well it looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates . re well we know now that facebook has the power to shift about  votes to hillary  on election day with no one knowing this is occurring all they have to do is send out go out and vote reminders to hillary s supporters but not to s supporters that would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home so yes weve looked at facebook weve looked at twitter but again facebook can shift  votes google can shift somewhere between  and  million votes . rt have you been able to find abnormal search results by google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections . re we havent look carefully at too many countries weve looked at the uk election in  we looked at the national election in india at the lok sabha election in  what we do know is that it is the nature of googles algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another that happens automatically that happens as google would say organically so this means that googles algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years probably actually controlling the winner in as many as  percent of the national elections of the world . rt what do you think about this threat of big data do you think google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose . re well big data at the moment is a threat its a threat to democracy at least as we have it in the united states its a threat to human freedom its a threat to civil liberties this is mainly because the technologies are very new and new means of control of surveillance of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated  theyre not covered by any laws or regulations so the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies weve not developed systems for regulating these technologies obviously we must do so . rt youve said that unlike europe russia and china were able to overcome the google monopoly but a lot of people are still using this search engine do you think that the us company can manipulate public opinion in russia as well . re well its hard for them to manipulate opinion if they dont dominate that country google dominates most of the countries in the world the only countries it doesnt dominate are russia and china so russia and china are protected a little bit from google but russia and china have their own problems russia has yandex china has baidu and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that google is using and perhaps theyre already using these techniques these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions . my newest research shows for example that google seems to be favoring hillary  in its search suggestions the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item and from new research ive done we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate so google is not the only problem any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance for manipulation for control and i think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world not just google . rt how do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like google . re well the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public the private company does not have people who we voted on the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous the situation right now is unprecedented in human history there has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws beyond the reach of any regulations and who dont necessarily have the public interest in mind . rt what about donald  in your opinion what methods and tricks has donald  and his loyal media used in this presidential race . re well ive said in writing repeatedly and in many interviews that im a very strong supporter of hillary  hillary  is by far the better candidate donald  is a very weak candidate he would not make a good leader he would not make a good president plus i know people in his family it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president i dont think he wants to be president i think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network and i think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that . the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous . i made a prediction on twitter recently you can check this i not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show it will be a reality tv show about donald  running for president and that will be a hit show so i think thats his only interest here hillary  will become our next president its guaranteed and in my opinion donald  has no interest never had any interest in becoming president . rt do you believe that hillary  will become us president through the manipulation of public opinion . re oh hillary  is guaranteed to win this election and i have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote that those polls did not take into account the power that google and other companies have to shift votes thats missing from these polls so once you realize the power that these companies have hillary  is absolutely guaranteed to win and she will win in the margin of somewhere between  million and  million votes if we take the mean the average of those two numbers i guess you could say its pretty clear that she will win by approximately  million votes . rt given that the united states has such an expensive and powerful media industry would you say that voters in the us have a real picture of the presidential campaign . re well voters in the united states i think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers magazines and the internet more than  different television channels so i think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive so were getting one perspective from one magazine another perspective from another magazine . but when you come to something like google theres no competition theres no competitor its a completely different kind of influence its noncompetitive in other words if youre still trying to make up your mind and you go to google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily easily tip your opinion one way or the other and theres no competitor theres no way for anyone to compensate what google just told you . so this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence it has no competition theres no corrective for it and people trust google  we know this from surveys  people trust google more than they trust any newspaper any magazine or any television station people trust information that they get from a computer much more than information theyre getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased because they know that people are actually giving them the information but when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial that information is objective and of course thats not really true but thats what people believe"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context. book of job . job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children   god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god   to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children. once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die. i would rather be strangled. rather die than suffer like this. i hate my life and dont want to go on living. oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job . why make me your target. am i a burden to you. why not just forgive my sin. and take away my guilt. for soon i will lie down in the dust and die. when you look for me i will be gone job . what do you gain by oppressing me. why do you reject me the work of your own hands. while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job . he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words. the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine. its branches spreading across the garden. its roots grow down through a pile of stones. it takes hold on a bed of rocks. but when it is uprooted. its as though it never existed job . when a plague sweeps through. he laughs at the death of the innocent. the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked. and god blinds the eyes of the judges. if hes not the one who does it who is job . just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life. whatever happens i will be found guilty. so whats the use of trying. even if i were to wash myself with soap. and clean my hands with lye. you would plunge me into a muddy ditch. and my own filthy clothing would hate me job . the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions. pay attention to this job. stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god. do you know how god controls the storm. and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds. do you understand how he moves the clouds. with wonderful perfection and skill. when you are sweltering in your clothes. and the south wind dies down and everything is still. he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror. can you do that job . god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with . who is this that questions my wisdom. with such ignorant words. brace yourself like a man. because i have some questions for you. and you must answer them. where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth. tell me if you know so much. who determined its dimensions. and stretched out the surveying line. what supports its foundations. and who laid its cornerstone. as the morning stars sang together. and all the angels shouted for joy job . god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence. then the lord said to job. do you still want to argue with the almighty. you are gods critic but do you have the answers. then job replied to the lord. i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers. i will cover my mouth with my hand. i have said too much already. i have nothing more to say job . you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance. it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about. things far too wonderful for me. you said listen and i will speak. i have some questions for you. and you must answer them. i had only heard about you before. but now i have seen you with my own eyes. i take back everything i said. and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job . other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue. wake up o lord why do you sleep. get up do not reject us forever. why do you look the other way. why do you ignore our suffering and oppression. we collapse in the dust. lying face down in the dirt. rise up help us. ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm . and the usual response is to not question god. what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator. does a clay pot argue with its maker. does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying. stop youre doing it wrong. does the pot exclaim. how clumsy can you be. how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father. why was i born. or if it said to its mother. why did you make me this way isaiah . after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before. so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job . you have to be patient with god. those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm . the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other. book of ecclesiastes . the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned. everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes . what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard. for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes . i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes . so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes . all is vanity. for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes . promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god. i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes . solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does. when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes . at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery. so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes . one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job. the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior. read more the old testaments sexist views on female behavior"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders november   work  money . to launch a return of kings tshirt shop i decided to go with shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store i signed up with them paid for one year of service and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers which resulted in  orders as i began fulfilling them shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data . because of shopifys decision my customers couldnt access their order status i had no way of informing them of what happened and i couldnt fulfill remaining orders they put both me and  individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders the backstory . there are many open source solutions for hosting a web store the problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it compared to services like shopify squarespace bigcommerce magento and others to get the rok store up and running as quickly as possible i picked shopify because of their competitive prices not knowing that i was in for a far greater price down the road . after i set up the store featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt i collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch i sent this group an email announcing the store and  of them took action ordering a tshirt or two the shirt in question . during this time i received an email from a shopify risk analyst by the name of  he asked me to send in identification which i was happy to do and then asked me for more information . thanks for signing up with shopify payments and providing your id . in order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information . if you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great examples would be a business bank statement business license or business registration documents . could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from . i sent in my business incorporation documents my irs employer number designation a recent bank statement from my usbased bank and a note of how i often travel through eastern europe but that my business bank accounts and tax status all reside in the united states in spite of that shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it . unfortunately shopify payments is currently only available to companies that are based in australia canada united kingdom and the united states so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses but we need to make sure were abiding by both us and international regulations this means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule but you wont be able to use shopify payments to accept any further payments  . despite the information provided our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based operating from and have a substantial presence in the united states . ultimately their decision is final and we must respect it . according to the united states federal government and the irs my company is american and liable to pay american taxes but to shopify im not an american business the repercussion from this was that i couldnt use shopifys own payment system shopify payments and had to pay a  extra commision on all orders but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options i stayed the course because i wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers i could always change stores later when it was convenient for me the disaster . i have a worker based in the united states who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out he printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment before he was finished i tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this . the public storefront was also taken down there was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered i couldnt even send them an email i then received this from  . hello . im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on shopify . we will transfer your existing payments to you but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from shopify payments . im sorry we wont be able to help with your business . regards .  . after i read this email i was absolutely livid ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that i would personally classify as fraud . they allowed me to take  orders begin processing them and then removed all access so i could not complete fulfillment imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order you would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that i took your money and ran shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for  individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if im running some sort a scam operation the phone call to support . i called support and got on the line with a level  support tech i told him the situation as calmly as i could his response send an email reply to  this was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning i demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely i was not calling shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas . i also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while i was in the middle of fulfillment if shopify is so worried about fraud why would they leave  individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies i had no choice but to threaten legal action i told the support tech that if shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these  orders i would pursue all legal means as a response to what i saw as fraud . the support tech put me on hold after a few minutes of chatting with the risk team he said that they have given him permission to send me a csv file of all my orders i decided that this was enough to satisfy the  individuals who purchased from me but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt . before ending the call with the support tech i told him to relay to  and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that i will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did not just to me but also to my customers who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform . using the csv file i received i was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail the lesson . shopify has every right to choose who to do business with and i would not be particularly upset if they said i have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders  but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner no owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers i have never been treated so poorly by an american internet business before and im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long . maybe my situation was special as i am often abroad but shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country if you log in from a certain ip address pool their algorithms go crazy and here comes  to hit the delete button on your store with one click . whatever the reason its important for existing and potential shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause they will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action and that may be no guarantee of success if any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use i will strongly warn them against shopify . as for the rok store ive decided to try the open source method hopefully we will be ready for orders again within two months nov   roosh valizadeh"}

fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge . the fulltime lhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later . it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive . he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number . the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said . the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation . juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict . all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote . but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the lhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout . prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said . they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when    met with harney county sheriff  and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land . defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers . five of the seven defendants including  testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change . the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted . inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof . juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place . juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really . juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased . it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell . juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself . in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions . juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us . the ville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals . dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us . the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford . he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty . the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison . we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said .  maxine bernstein"}

of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal  will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows  possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that  enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j  source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome  is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most  supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some  supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that  enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and  loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about  tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that  has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that s original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence   was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that  tv  or whatever they end up calling it   tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like s maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald  will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and  will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and  had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see  tv however i dont see  being the driving force behind the actual message  is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate  works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming  years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics"}

new  probe dead from the start  best friend at doj in charge of investigation  november   leave a comment . late on friday evening the fbi announced the reopening of its investigation of hillary  and her opprobrious emails and the department of justice quickly followed suit on monday vowing to dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in the  case according to a tweet by the associated press  breaking justice dept says itll dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in  case .  the associated press ap october   . both announcements made after  aid  emails were discovered on estranged husband  computer come amid growing internal contention as the fbi and doj parse out how to deal with the pressure of a rapidly approaching presidential election as well as public perception the original investigation had been purposely bumbled in favor of the democratic nominee . however welcome or unwelcome the news of reopened investigations might be one major detail  revealed in wikileaks ongoing publications of    emails  presents evidence the justice departments probe could amount to little more than a smoke screen to placate an irate public . assistant attorney general  promised congress in a letter the justice department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible breaking senior doj official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review days pictwittercompcgtodkqd .  just the facts jtf_news october   . perhaps that vow from a government branch putatively dedicated to ensuring the criminal element is duly punished for misbehavior should reassure those increasingly suspicious of an obviouslyrigged system . perhaps before wikileaks revealed interdepartmental communications and corruption that promise might have held weight beyond a symbolic gesture of obligation  but as s emails reveal its entirely possible this reopened investigation is failed from the start . k in fact maintains a cozy enough relationship with  to have had dinner with the  insider just one day after the former secretary of state testified before the house select committee on benghazi last october . and the pairs familiarity isnt held to a simple dinner party as the daily caller reported   and k the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january k and  who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate s birthday and in another sent last may ks son emailed  asking for a job on the  campaign . so k  an extremely close friend to the chair of hillary s presidential campaign  is tasked with heading the newly reopened investigation of hillary  .  couldnt ask for an arrangement better situated to again find insufficient evidence worthy of bringing charges against her as far as conflicts of interest go this takes the cake . the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust matthew whitaker told the daily caller  . if political wranglings and connections marred transparency and neutrality the first time around it would be reasonable to assume the players havent since magically unentangled themselves from  and her campaign mere days before americans take to the polls . its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary  whitaker continued also noting the controversial meeting between bill  and attorney general loretta lynch on an airport tarmac in phoenix during the dojs previous investigation . in fact k as an obama appointee to the justice department beginning in  also initiated the effort to have loretta lynch appointed to the role of attorney general . and the friendship between k and   as well as their connections to the obama administration and additional officials overseeing the  investigation  spans decades . in  for example as the washington free beacon reported from one of the leaked emails  emailed an obama campaign official to recommend k have a supportive role in obamas presidential campaign  particularly because the latter was a fantastic lawyer who managed to keep  out of jail . although k as head of the office of legislative affairs does not have a direct role in chain of command for the  investigation he does field inquiries from congress concerning her emails . noted by the daily caller  in november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation which sparked outrage by the gop over potential conflicts of interest . florida rep ron desantis voiced particular concerns about lynchs longtime connections to the s in a february   letter  and that obamas appointees are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states . while the daily caller s report goes much further in depth concerning the relationships of  and k with the s and their insiders it can be easily surmised in even a simple perusal of facts there could be no possible way an investigation this critical  and with resounding implications  would maintain any semblance of impartiality . when julian assange vociferously denounces the us electoral and political systems as rigged beyond repair these connections are precisely what hes referring to . it might calm an irate public to hear an investigation had to be

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "at the third debate  was asked if he would accept the results of the election  responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that  was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can  overcome it. why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short. woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation . it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system. for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation. everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like  the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure  does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short. voter fraud . the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address  outlined some of the ways in which this occurs. according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote. liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult. by raising concerns about voter fraud  is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether  will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place. the lÃ¼genpresse . a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade.  is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity  has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt s numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources. new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to  but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that  is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side. voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage  voters. another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage  voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like  is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than  but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in . there is a huge motivation gap between  and clinton recently  held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see  a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to

currently chairman representative  is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the pennsylvania constitution i contend . probably nothing encapsulates and explains the emfrfr controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the page report  europaem emf guideline  for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of emfrelated health problems and illnesses  which is a spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanunciosmsghtml this report cites  published scientific references which leaves  to question why the pa pucand peco in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the s era safety thermal science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety . those safety studies originated in germany during world war ii are totally outmoded but remain the present federal communications commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and ami smart meters it is now  how come s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the internet of things  has to question the credibility factor of both peco and the pa puc for depending upon  science in todays technology world of  wheres the science later than the s please may i have those studies peco supplied to the pa puc .  therefore respectfully suggests that the pa puc study the aboveaforementioned european reports with medical and ehs health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting ami smart meters and their continuous rfremf healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters . children are the most vulnerable to emf radiation and therefore i introduce exhibit u why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences and exhibit u american academy of pediatrics august   letter urging the food and drug administration commissioner the federal communications commission and others to advise the public about specific absorption rates sars regarding emfrf exposures . also i want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity ehs is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ecopsychology professor pamela reed gibson states the following  of the usa population  of the swedish population  of the danish population and   of the german population are ehs compromised see exhibit v  however other sources claim that as much as  of the entire worlds population is affected . just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji . as exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics  from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters . before i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be s obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides  with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by . furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with  certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as  times a day . no medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science . therefore  should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds . just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which  does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents . therefore  feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times  makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own . ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles . i am in my  th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record  of us adults and  of us children used whats referred to as cam in  per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health . however the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one . therefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over  years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author . that i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its  ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments  expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my  book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities . additionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called  turn off the violence  was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues . furthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that . attorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting s cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because s medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record  does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right . i respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are not the issue whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiespeco included the pa puc and the commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom rfemf and dirty electricity produced by ami smart meters affect and impact negatively . before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot s vintage radar safety researchfor rfsemfs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health i feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the ami smart meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation rfsemfs smart meters impact upon human tissue . there are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from pa pucpeco forced ami smart meter  rfemf electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing pa population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon penna medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the commonwealth . to cement that forewarning i offer the world health organizations statistic approximately  of reported cases of ehs electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving that however does not include cancerinduced health issues from rfsemfs what kind of budget shortfall will ami smart meters adverse health effects eventually generate for pas legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed has anyone thought about that very real problem . continued in part

{"label": "hate", "text": " the   was one of the pivotal figures of russian history his reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted russia to become and sometimes in history personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men. russia in his day was still halfbarbarous to rule her he had to be an absolute monarch and never for a moment doubted his right to be so his personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day alcohol was considered then as now an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption his sexual appetites were as normal as any mans but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western europe. he did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom when  of denmark teased him about the type of women he chose his response was brother my women do not cost me much but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere. . he chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name st sburg he liked maritime affairs and wanted to be near the sea he disliked the atmosphere of moscow with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters it was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs  introduced conscription a professional officer class and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality. he realized that he would never be able to make russia into a  power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people and like many rulers before and after him he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be after his death many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from by imperial decree he banished beards in  an exception was made for the orthodox patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax we are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair lest they incur some disfavor from the saints. but there was method to s apparent madness he understood that appearance and thought are connected and that if a man wished to change one he had to change the other in   decreed that all royal officials had to adopt westernstyle clothing trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not like kemal ataturk two centuries later he had no patience for backsliders or protesters whom he swept aside ruthlessly in social relations he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the mongols. these reforms gained  some bitter enemies among the clergy for centuries the russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life s reforms threatened to erode this base and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief they also suspected him of having had too much contact with western europeans a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist  did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters it was his responsibility to bring russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated.  solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the orthodox church in  when patriarch adrian died he did not appoint a successor and went one step further in  by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether in its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure the church effectively became an arm of the state ecclesiastical grumbling was audible but  wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine he cared about power not theology. slowly he made progress in industrialization this frankly could only be done with dictatorial power and to this end he reorganized the traditional russian boyar system in place of the old aristocracy a new one arose that was based on military and civil function his rule saw some success in mining and textile work when  died in  russia was exporting iron and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competitionto pay for all this  unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance state tax revenues rose from  million rubles in  to  million in  the majority of this revenue went to the military. a russian boyar. ambitious plans existed for education too  ordered the old slavonic alphabet used by the church to be replaced by a new system based on greek letters he imported printing presses founded institutes and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western europe. what was the net result of all this effort the picture was a mixed one reformers are not usually popular as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups the peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging the nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the french nobles hated richelieu and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other. as his unpopularity grew  resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs perhaps there was no other way but at the very least his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag russia kicking and screaming into the modern era some of his achievements were lasting and significant and some were not in history even  men must contend with the limitations of their era and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance it is on this precarious tightrope that all  men walk. read more   more countries to emigrate to if the west collapses"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep  ventures where few dare to tread october    . in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative  of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed . on tuesday  held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america . this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism . and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent  and  whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  .  and  presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since  the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas .  and  did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence . predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against  rep  is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep  as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community . the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates . but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered s study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection .  and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc  dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever . the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole electronic election fraud exposed   warscom  october   comments . establishment politicians and press are outraged that  would question the integrity of their system . they say it undermines public trust in political institutions . yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections who are shutting down election audit procedures who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony . one such person is texas director of elections  . this story is specific to texas but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting . i went to the texas secretary of state offices to ask mr  about specific procedural changes he has made in his  year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in august that would have gone into effect this november . with camera  mic in hand we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the director about the election . we were told to wait in the lobby and mr  would be down . you can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with wars . the man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions . so much for transparency and candor . this unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law . what follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in texas . but before we get to specifics about his actions  his connection to the rose law firm in arkansas there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide .  why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard .  why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers  officials . burning the paper trail . in august   texas director of elections attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming november  election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting his office issued new rules that would . eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers . eliminate printing of early voting results tapes . eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts . fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed with a formal public hearing scheduled after the november election . state senator  said the states chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more realtime paper records and backups not fewerthe comfort  convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters confidence and election integrity . but even though these procedures have been postponed s previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the november election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated here are some of the problems .  waiver of laws requiring a partial manual recount audit .  waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in  of the election precincts or  election precincts whichever is greater this was waived in all  counties the day after the march  primary the timing is significant because during the primary there were  move votes than voters in hill county in the republican primary the margin of victory was  in texas house district  that contains hill county in calling for a criminal investigation  noted that it appears  or  voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures .  waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes . s waivers issued in   and  appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws      and the judges handbook these rules require   three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates  on completion of the vote count the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct with total number of voters total number of votes with the presiding judge signing each of the  copies to certify .  also issued waivers for requirements that a zero tape be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a tally tape printed at the close of election his letter states that the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day . so expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections and if a favored vendor cant perform to the law the law is waived . if proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state instead of waived by  the hill county issue of  more voters than votes would not have happened the vendor in hill county ess eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying an audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning early voting or election day ballotsthere are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error . but the director of elections is waiving those established election protocols s waver of legal requirements  his improvised solution of printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day opens the door for error and fraud .  ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts . the secretary of state election division claims that cast vote records are equivalent to ballot images as you can see the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered . the texas constitution article   suffrage section  says in all elections by the people the vote shall be by ballot and the legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box . yet the machines by vendors hart intercivic and ess certified by  do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and dont provide other components of a legal texas ballot .  ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion . texas election code sec  says a watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving . affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in dallas county with official poll watcher signed forms detail how they were repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the dallas county central counting station such as ballot scanning vote transfer ballot transfer computer activities ballot tabulation and viewing the elections computer line printer they state that they were repeatedly treated disrespectfully obstructed and blatantly ignored by the election officials and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the texas secretary of state elections office . hostility to election monitors like s refusal to answer our questions destroy the publics confidence in the honesty of the process  and rightfully so . s connections to arkansas kutak rock rose law firm  hillary clinton . according to a public rmation request of s secretary of state personnel file  left private practice and moved to little rock arkansas taking a job with the law firm kutak rock ll at kutak rock he worked under the managing partner gordon miller wilbourn who had been a partner with hillary clinton vince foster and webster hubbell at the rose law firm in arkansas in the s the wilbourn family is a large donor to the clinton foundation and the hillary clinton campaign .  left kutak rock to return to texas when he was hired by gov rick perrys appointment office in  to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts boards  commissions . ss career moves are interesting in just  months his journey from private practice in texas through arkansas clintoncronies and back to texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half in   was promoted to director of the election division in the texas secretary of states office where his salary was still  less than private practice . s determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big clinton donors . establishment of both parties dont appear to want election integrity . in one lawsuit contesting election results for austin city council the county could not produce any ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount computer logs had multiple corruptioninvalid errors during discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in  of the  precincts forming the district one precinct had  voter turnout another was just  registered voters shy of  in spite of only  and  countywide turnout in the general and runoff elections . the county democrat party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities . there are some positive developments however the republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly republican county and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by governor abbotts office . state senator bob hall said due to an increasing number of complaints it is time for the texas elections division office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that officeand instruct all texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws . voters regardless of political affiliation should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest transparent elections for example chambers county in texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected its time to remove  as texas director of elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots"}

a fictitious donor meet with  who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting  for president until the videos started appearing last week . he said  who boasted of working directly for the  campaign directed that the  donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops .  said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves .  was clear about his ties to  stating every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters . sign the precedentsetting petition supporting s call for an independent

fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between s campaign the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change . the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after s announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities .  and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission . among the revelations in the latest video was  was boasting of his close links to president   barack s was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago . when asked whether a potential donor could meet   said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in  days  i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the  the health care bill trying to make america more

doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the  presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that  promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was . what does  mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise  won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and  rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope  can put americans back in their own homes .  father and son started never ending wars  continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation s dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so  standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so . all the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay  per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for  and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that . the good news is that  made public what was private  racism misogyny in a country that never stops eting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here  proved that it is happening and has eted it from the top of  tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go . as for muslims and  believe me  is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and  begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players . india is a classic example where a socalled minority of  million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script  million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming  or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that . two other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on  if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it . global warming america decided on that when it chose  instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with  that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient . add to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when i think about all this and s election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise . final question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like  with his finger on the nuclear button . my answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from  as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest . meanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from  and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night world sleep well as long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility . mirza yawar baig is based in hyderabad india and is the

{"label": "hate", "text": "the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october    . by now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city . on april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries . unsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution . that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble . but following the vote a crack appeared in the faÃ§ade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister  termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history . france is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from  statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october . the october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body . of the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends . following the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem . brazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness . even unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion . on wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent . the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best . given the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support . israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un . nevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel . there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation . the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "before s glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness i promised that i would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy if  had prevailed the roadmap would have been a grim one as all of our work would have had to take place underground happily we will be able to work in the open here are three ways that we can leverage s victory to bring back the patriarchy. rule yourself  is a good role model for traditional men urbane fit financially independentand dangerous. this may seem obvious but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy we have to be men who are worthy of it a patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown however a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it thus the first step in making progress under a  administration is the same as it would have been if  had been electedselfimprovement. selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape training martial arts getting rid of addictions and exercising selfdiscipline the process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life for most men this will involve adopting and faithfully living one of the faithtraditions for others it may mean adopting stoic philosophy whatever it is it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate pleasure wealth and power at any cost morality of our spirit cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place. selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence under a  administration this last goal will become easier to achieve s tax plan cuts tax rates across the board this will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income they will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy. s emphasis on fair trade will also result in more american jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity the age of  will be a great time to start a new business one word of warning is in order though under  the us is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the s enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround our goal is a lifetime of financial independence not conspicuous consumption. financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step which is ruling your family. rule your family be the patriarch. starting with the boomers our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism families got smaller divorce became more common promiscuity increased feminism became the default philosophy for girls and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism. a  administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family at best the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it but real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition for us that means finding a traditional woman or more likely one who can be converted to tradition getting married and having lots of children a twitter shitlord  johnrandom  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep  bump starter kit. . . . . getting married having children and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game but it is the only way we will have long term victory without a next generation of traditional men any ground that we gain under  will soon be lost. rule societybring back the patriarchy benjamin franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty. the next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions  has captured the presidency and republicans control congress but many of those republicans are cucks who will oppose the ian agenda and our other institutions are still dominated by leftists hollywood the news media education and corporations all proclaim the progressive antipatriarchy message if we dont take advantage of the current moment any gains that  makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office. therefore we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards patriarchal nationalism  you can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments here id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the republican party  has created many allies within the gop but the majority of the party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like nafta the gop desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help  achieve his vision. getting involved in your local gop is easy you merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district you dont have to run for elected office simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected voting for delegates or attending gop events go in with a respectful attitude a lot of the local gop leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists work for incremental change and if you have the disposition required for it consider running for local office yourself. one piece of advice if you do choose to get involved in politics dont get caught up in it one way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch gop is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor the other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of  clinton if you do choose to enter the political realm resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain dont make politics your life think of it strictly as civic duty. of course politics is not everybodys cup of tea the key is to use your gifts whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish. conclusion the one thing we must not do in wake of the  victory is rest on our laurels if  had won wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life now that  is coming into power the temptation is to relaxto just let  do it all this temptation must be avoided we must capitalize on the  victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a  victory if we dont we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained. read more how donald  vanquished his enemies and conquered the

{"label": "hate", "text": "the celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that  is our next president an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months now that weve gotten what we wanted its time to describe exactly how a  presidency will improve our standing. if the president can say it then you can say it . the biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness we now have a shitlord for president who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs and whose private macho talk which all masculine men have done was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth this means that when you talk like  the first thought your listener will have is he sounds like the president of the united states. what excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it either  was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the american people has stated that you can exercise your free speech your opinions and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities you can begin removing your politically correct filter. im in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a  scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude we may have to institute a new feature called would  bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves and neither should you. liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before . there are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before what are they going to do fire everyone who supports  accuse every man who voted for him of rape the way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure but now we have natural allies in all men who back  even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity . liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before they will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist they will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly it may be as simple as whipping out your maga hat as if its a bat signal and having fellow  supporters come to your aid i know that if i see a  supporter in trouble i will help him regardless of his race or station liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate instead of trying to exile them like in the past. it will be easier to find a fellow traveler . men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted if youre like me you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on rok or the forum  we now have a easier shortcut in . if a man tells you that he voted for  its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders nationalism  masculinity and beautiful women on a basic level you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond it also works the other way around where you bring up  to screen out those who are offended by him its fine if someone is politically indifferent but if a man opposes  then i have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future i will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing. the cultural decline will halt . we now have a president who will not encourage antimale propaganda rape culture and female victimhood while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter ivanka  will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation it is more than enough for  to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order stop feeding the rot and it will die off allowing biology to naturally reassert itself. weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt instead weve been reacting from one blow to the next whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way. conclusion paradoxically the benefits of a  presidency will not involve specific actions from  his presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist while we may still get heat for them it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left victories will be far easier to achieve under  than obama. this is our moment the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for  to do anything his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors it would be icing on the cake if  rolled back antimasculine laws and policies but its not required because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands return of kings opened in  and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled. read

as dangerous and temperamental because it is  that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable . she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades   played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as  and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over . someone that shares this opinion with me is  according to reuters   recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to  . on syrias civil war    could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict .  has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets . what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria   as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his  national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to  . in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it . and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians . according to national intelligence director   that could have dire consequences . russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director   tuesday . i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground   speaking with cbs  at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues . of course  is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  . right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added . but  is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants . you see the truth is that  wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all . thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide . so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already  that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control . one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike  even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if  is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want  to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  . mrs  has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr  on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin  . naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted . anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that  is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality . and even now the obama administration and our nato

infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia . after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad . a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic . the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and

are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  . russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities . at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back . the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials  were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats . i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of  would greatly accelerate the march toward war . in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out . at this point it looks like  is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia . if you are reading this and you are considering voting for  please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time . if the american people do choose  this november i believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly bitterly regret in future years this article was posted thursday october   at  am

{"label": "bias", "text": "by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by  . for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population . on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  . a spokesman for the boston archdiocese  made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  .  it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  . seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system . now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said .  out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  . although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal . in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  .  the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  . one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year . why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  . the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned . the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need . the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money . this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis . ht patheos"}

the white house prior to the election i described the period of time ending on january th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because  was victorious on election night as you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of s victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard . and the truth is that  has not even won the presidency yet as i detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until december th when the electoral college meets . on monday december th the members of the electoral college will gather in all  state capitals to cast their votes for president it is then and only then that the next president of the united states will be elected . throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than  perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible though not probable that  could win the election . one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than  million people the petition claims that  is unfit to serve as president and that since  won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead the following comes from a usa today article entitled  could the electoral college elect     . a changeorg petition now signed by more than  million people encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for  when the college meets on dec  the petition argues that  is unfit to serve and that secretary  won the popular vote and should be president . if they all vote the way their states voted  will win the petition states however they can vote for  if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure  supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary  . personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome . however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on november th there have been a multitude of violent threats against  and his family and without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep  from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family . if  were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place . but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including  . if everything goes smoothly and  successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history . in an article for the most important news  i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible . this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media . traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot . let us hope that they are not successful . another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what  may choose to do at the united nations . now that it looks like  is going to be our next president the international pressure on  to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense . and this is something that  and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the  team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office  . saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition  national security advisor for  last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office . on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect  are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico  . specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state . just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president  would not be able to undo . the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of  and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann  . the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict . israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations . the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen . he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office  wsj reported . if  decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating . but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because  has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians . when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in   . so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if  is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times . my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful . and as i detailed in a previous article   will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year  on the hebrew calendar . could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe . or will the next two months

a last resort attack a conservative . liberalism is godlessness df nj . you only criticize and hate on other peoples character what you do not like about your own character . otherwise if you are able to meet people as being sacred then all you have remaining is unconditional love and acceptance of other peoples flaws . where does civility come from if not from having respect for opposing opinions isa . the election is over these demonstrations mean nothing these are bunch of winy liberals breaking laws did conservative do these childish things in  or  . n  . i wonder what obamas pardon list looks like jc teecher . jesse james jackson a pawn for the left is pushing hard to have hitlery pardoned for all her crimes before she is even charged as a crook himself he has received a free pass because of his so called religious connections bull caca occult religions maybe mondobeyondo . yes there is still a possibility that  could still get in the oval office but a  presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood the secret service had better guard him and his family very closely from what ive seen and heard president obama is trying to make s transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other lets hope that s presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country back in  i bought a brand new book called the art of the deal at my college bookstore it was written by some guy named  yes i actually did read it df nj . not a chance hillary is dead and gone mondobeyondo .  is actually liberal enough to sign a resolution that would divide the land of israel  would have to be pressured by outside forces to make such a decision would he do it dont know although from what ive heard president putin of russia likes  a lot df nj . we dropped  bombs on five predominately muslim countries in  maybe its time to give the yinon plan a rest and stop bombing ragheads for israel . america first we have way too many problems and debt in this country to continue our foreign policies of american adventurism wheres pat buchanan when you need him i think its time we return to a more traditional conservative approach to foreign policy the long war does absolutely nothing to make me feel safer on the streets of newark or jersey city i say eff em america first thelulzwarrior . who fing cares israel is not an us state so far they would simply refuse to go along such a plan paul patriot . freedom loving americans should know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on december th . the left can whine shout protest and riotits time freedom loving americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyrannyand apathy passivity fear and political correctness will prove ineffective . the liberty tree is getting mighty thirstyjust saying df nj . there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks . an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for . for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness . against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  . you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value . but do not fear every year the top  become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less . see you in the breadlines comrades ???????? ??? jc teecher . it is fairly evident that b hussein odrama is spewing his nwo rhetoric and propaganda overseas as he attempts to assume the role of the worlds authoritarian he was handpicked by the biggest nazi since hitler behind the scenes as in ghw bush odrama was chosen by the underworld as a successor to ghwb and billery . why to fulfill their occultic destiny of the beast system of gov religion education and economics the four hidden dynasties also viewed as dienasty if one is part of it . anything is possible in the next two months and with the huge amounts of  invested into continuing an evil empire the underworldshadow gov will use any and all means to make their plans come to fruition . all we as christians can do is prepare for the worst and pray for the will of god to become manifest for his purpose pleasure and fulfillment of the end of days of this age . the time of the fulfillment of a  year generation since the planting of the fig tree house of judah in israel is drawing nigh . christ said the generation that sees it nation of israel replanted in the covenant land will also see his return glory glory hallelujah we might just get out of this worldalive not fly away in a pretrib rapture trap but change in the twinkling of an eye here in this earth to be a part of the

{"label": "hate", "text": "what motivates you to live what is the meaning of life. for centuries mankind has questioned everything mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis in fact its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time stoicism  although not directly attributed to answering what drives us skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life. while many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force and the will to live theres a problem inherent with such an analysis in order to research such a basic and instinctual topic one needs to experience a visceral cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic instinctual level before having such an epiphany one needs to examine our animalistic base and then explore logically from there. one such analysis is known as logotherapy from the greek word logoswise  logotherapy developed by  is an influential school of psychotherapy that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind before we delve into logotherapy however its important that we discuss who he was and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority. .  was born in  in what was at that time known as austriahungary  was a neurologist and psychiatrist his early life was relatively unspectacular but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy as well as psychotherapy initially interested in  and s work he began to see their faults and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression as well as suicide. during   in completing his residency in neurology was responsible for setting up the selbstmÃ¶rderpavillon  translated in english to the suicide pavilion its estimated that  along with his staff treated upwards of  women who had suicidal tendencies. in september of  his life was shaken  along with his wife and family were deported to a nazi concentration camp known as theresienstadt ghetto whilst there and during his stay at auschwitz  worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit focusing on mental health helping newcomers deal with shock and grief. . in  after three years in a concentration camp  released his book entitled mans search for meaning  which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor as well as his theory which became known as logotherapy the book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences whereas part two discusses logotherapy. his time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical and psychiatric theory while he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others  began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind as a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates he was in a very unique position. hundreds and during some weeks thousands of helpless inmates were carted in auschwitz the mostfeared concentration camp weekly between the inmates sleeping next to him and those seeking treatment  noted that each prisoner without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp these stages were shock apathy and depersonalization. while seemingly unimportant the noted documentation of these stages was very important for  as he began to notice while every inmate experienced these stages some experienced them to a less cerebral degree some inmates seemed less depressive than others and featured a happier disposition these inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates. discovery as he began to poke and prod  noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope there is never not meaning in life every moment no matter how painful dehumanizing or horrendous it is has meaning by extension  suggests even suffering is meaningful the inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest had hope  suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day without hope they were doomed. everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way. the next question that  sought to answer was an important one and the foundational maxim of logotherapywhy did some men have hope and others not. the answer was love. the truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved.  in his book mans search for meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating during a latenight march in bare feet or watching his friend get treated inhumanely hed vacillate from depression by thinking and longing for his wife the men whom lasted the longest invariably had a wife or a job that they loved it was this motivator the unquantifiable love that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm and put mind above body. what we can get from this to answer this  codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  a job love and how we react to suffering its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that  is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not he is suggesting however that should we not have a jobdeed or love that allow us to find meaning in life we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us theoretically speaking. the average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that  and so many others dealt with what we can do however is choose how we react to lifes adversities. a fair assessment of logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life since life is such a complex series of events logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies in saying this my own personal evaluation is that this criticism in itself may have flaws by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution even the assumption that life in complex can be debated its a cliched saying that life is hard or complexand even if it is its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us.  died in september  and his works are still read today several logotherapy institutes exist today named after him. read more does life have inherent meaning without belief in god"}

not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds . the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis  berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrÃ©s started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same . such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter . it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them . the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron . two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and Ã©mile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism . voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence . zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story . voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress . thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay . even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protÃ©gÃ©  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts . today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them . in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily . old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition . but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction . the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function . if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion . the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right . culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture . the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels . some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  renÃ© guÃ©non introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap renÃ© guÃ©non young . philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others renÃ© guÃ©non the crisis of the modern world  chap renÃ© guÃ©non older . the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius

grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious  she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while

lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses. military responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking  betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with  when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences. it all stems from the wikileaks release that included  emails and  attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee  says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july   wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported. russias leader  says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war  said during the st petersburg international economic forum  it is not in my nature to scold someone  but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in  they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world. more  things to expect with a  presidency  must be indicted how  ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have  warmongering over unfounded allegations. world rivals in the air. there is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it. the korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly. on  november  at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters. everything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six  caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers. it is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war. the soviets claimed  united nations planes of all types shot down including about  sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than  aircraft in air combat. the f pilots claimed  migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further  these numbers were later reduced to  migs the chinese air force claimed only  kills. in vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs  migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with  at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air. russias modern approach to warfare. during the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my  video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots  surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter. other looming conflicts. lest we forget s unwavering support of israel the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by us taxpayer money and military hardware the government of right wing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to violate the human

garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides . according to  the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said . a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  . as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides   said adding . theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change . a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  . additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent . said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members . over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies . and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately . only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales . aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales . none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators . of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data . we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause . science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  . several us

{"label": "bias", "text": "judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary unelected and unaccountable  rule on their empathetic feelings published  mins ago about   archive  joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print . a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law . alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice  this week federal judges as recently noted by chief  in his dissent in obergefell v   a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected . he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief  said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable .  previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings . obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said . he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice  who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced .  who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear s arguments .  said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable . unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law  warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states . dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family . before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable . he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa . the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires . he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional . the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law . mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing  said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of s case . chief justice  is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said . the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice  for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right . supporters of  also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice . she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice  . the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization . if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice  said tom ford a spokesman for the group . the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary .  was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary . daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation . it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said . horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america . how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution . samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john  clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it . the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states . it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority . for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way . they refused . then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage . and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people . as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm . critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest . the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned . rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage . at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation . washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained . justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned . if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said . see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol . the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil . and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court . wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate . it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  . we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell"}

negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors for over  deputies in the european parliament there are more than  thousands lobbyists the society for european affairs professionals seap  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in europe the european worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions multinational corporations will have unlimited power over european workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle. will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold. there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below. there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany. in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite. in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to s fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde. a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason. the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination. the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses. many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study. what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families. as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it. civil war on the horizon. the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class. the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frÃ©dÃ©ric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars. there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip  the most evil trade deal in history. french vicepresident of the trilateral commission herve de carmoy wrote a book in  entitled leuramerique  euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run by a financial oligarchy ceta is the prelude to that project"}

{"label": "bias", "text": "click for full size picturek my theory . my theory of the downing of the aircraft is derived from the two reported wreckage sites the lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still  miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged . first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that  plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist . while the plane carrying  and his party was still  miles from the crash site  mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time . according to the aviation week  space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs . lets look at the split radar first . the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the  aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event . the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the  aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left . now lets look at the awacs . the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list . if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced . how do we know that the awacs was tracking the  plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the  plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did . had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case . it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the  aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport . the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the  aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the  plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea . at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft . this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault . the data reported in the aviation week  space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the  aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder . the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system . simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the  possible trigger . given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope . the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say  feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore . as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield . this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore . the  mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same  mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used . its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted  it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather . there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a  knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at  feet visibility was km or  miles assorted news articles washington april

sharing his grief and trying to console the brown family friends and workers the browns have a son michael and a daughter tracey a family spokesman said the browns were still holding out hope the president and first lady hillary rodham clinton dressed in dark suits and wearing solemn faces spent nearly an hour at browns washington home where he lived with his wife alma couriers also arrived

in  and he was greatly credited with playing a key role in putting a democrat in the white house after the visit with the family the clintons immediately headed across town to commerce department headquarters where the president addressed employees who packed the auditorium clinton told the gathering that he his wife and other administration officials came to be with the employees of the commerce department at this very difficult hour the plane carrying secretary brown and his delegation including a number of your colleagues business leaders and leaders of the united states military went down today near dubrovnik croatia clinton told the workers we do not know for sure what happened there clinton said he asked browns wife what he should tell the department workers she said tell them ron was proud of them that he liked them that he believed in them and that he fought for the commerce department and tell them that youre going to do that now clinton said winning sustained applause from the crowd many of the hundreds of department employees were visibly shaken at the news with many crying and others holding and consoling one another also present at the commerce department when clinton spoke were several cabinet secretaries including attorney general janet reno agriculture secretary dan glickman housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros health

possibility of foul play there hasnt been any report over here indicating anything hostile but again we cant confirm that white house spokesman mike mccurry said republicans in congress have been working to dismantle the commerce department although a gop aide said wednesday the effort may be scrapped following the crash of browns plane washington reuter  president clintons wife hillary and daughter chelsea flew on the same plane last week that crashed in croatia with commerce secretary  aboard us air force sources said wednesday a military version of the widely used boeing  passenger jet flew mrs clinton and her yearold daughter from the turkish capital of ankara to the ancient biblical city of ephesus and on to istanbul last wednesday the ta plane with a tail number of  was based at the us air base at ramstein germany the sources said mrs clinton used it rather than the boeing  assigned to her for a weeklong goodwill tour of southern europe because of the short runway at ephesus the same plane was used to ferry defense secretary william perry in and out of bosnia last week mrs clinton also visited the yugoslav region during her trip but used a giant c military cargo

speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders. the  elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the  moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for  for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not  the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the  base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb  in the primaries. so white liberal anger about s victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of s politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates. the answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over  we cannot defeat s white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of  then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our own"}

{"label": "bs", "text": " shares.    . coming this weekend over  million pilgrims will rally in the holy city of karbala to mark the greatest pilgrimage of all  arbaeen right at the heart of iraq surrounded by the terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the . while arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted. arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of  has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism.  sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge. for those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny. more messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them. allow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the  was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt. only a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne. as bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people. and so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on . it is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity. arbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge. and while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember. arbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the  called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow. if many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity. arbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty. a city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans. every year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression. before the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite. a city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter. in the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver. and so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer. islam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put i arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you. a city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than i arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their coffers karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible. in a few short days karbala will stop time once more  so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of hussain are still standing vigil"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "search form search from bad to worse  s ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy  charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november    . most of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when  inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that  transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah  claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated . the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant  agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials . even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman  came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization . even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well . but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people  tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by  in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement . the  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but  neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic . moreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages . some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government . iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since  shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence . s actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity .  claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the  administration . there was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the  administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing . in addition to the  billion in cash  also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal . lastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries . in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy  pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney . if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case. while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws. federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography . what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id. the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty. why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however. dont take one for the team. for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since. till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges. the long arm of the law may reach you . well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton . moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game. while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction. this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges. branded for life . if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction. imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible. you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed. young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not

piece against the red pill  the media has called altright groups xenophobic racist and misogynist despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence. as anti rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on  voters. . despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple. truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and  is going to lead the way.

of individuals for inciting a race war.  hillary clinton jesse jackson   the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant. what ers far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things. potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way. first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for

the tangible impact of  voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change. a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the anti crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world. of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald . why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because s win restored faith in america.  rise of the new media . the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public. they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer. with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on. i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth . america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos. the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough s presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality. sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it. while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not. this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen.  massive boycotts of anti companies . the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when  supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful. in response to several ceos statements regarding s racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald  decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms. here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald  and his proamerican policies. pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against  directly has refused to do business with  or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives er . again what do these actions signify in  supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald  wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones. when donald s voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men. they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands. they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why  got into office and this is why were going to make america great again. read more  ways to start fighting back against the onslaught of liberalism"}

of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election . gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was  who was being investigated by the fbi .  explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  . we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record . the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general   who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill  to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that  is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election . heres s letter to the senate judiciary committee . really . the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi . thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something . this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine . on friday james  the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general   sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary s private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about  was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official  expressed her preference that  follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the out of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  . s decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials  who is a republican appointee of president  has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the out of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign . hillary  has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  . oh ill bet she does . ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that  decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach . of course when its her things are a little different arent they . we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her . and the fact that we know has severely damaged s campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over  due to the  email scandal . about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support  given fbi director james s disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of s use of a private email server while secretary of state  . finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary  . but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be . given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference . meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now . why did james  who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the s feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation . opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons . they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the  email negligence . they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it  isnt taking it gracefully . s complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before . this is from the telegraph  a uk publication . hillary  was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails . james  announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs  was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material . on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put   percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously . but wait  it gets better . the  campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr  alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive

addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida . democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which s as polls showed mrs s lead falling just  days before the presidential election . this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just bes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee . the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can . we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your

it is but truly the root of feminisms death was in man capital m from the very beginning one look at  is all a man needs to know this truth . feminism is dead the movement is absolutely dead . the womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long theres no room for dissent its just like mean girls . if they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction my wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced i was practically lynched for endorsing the    is still saying im not a feminist who made her pope . feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women you cant talk to them about anything .   on rob ford rihanna and rape culture for macleansca . neurotic women indeed . paul joseph watson of infowarsprison planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of  but he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war . the feminist attempt to demonize normal malefemale behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month . when you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as  the queen of s patriarchal sexist misogyny to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds . and when i say hearts and minds i mean the silent majority of young women who want nothing to do with feminism .  makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys so too will jawas darth vader   apparently that sly dude who knew . and thats a good thing men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl this is how men and women were created and evolved you cant fight darwin and god and come out on top . this video shows that the majority of normal women love male attention they want men to look at them they want men to notice them why . they want a man . i realized this is the case when i decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism  . this image from the women against feminism tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism this woman was raped she is not running around spreading lies like the uva rape hoax story that  stone ran and had to retract  she justs wants to go back to living a normal life she does not want to be angry at all men for the crime of one of them she does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge she does not want to be a victim feminists have lost the female youth of millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the st century . i understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared  the problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore but that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them . young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society . case in point . i met a wonderful young russian blonde a little while back twentythree tight feminine so freaking perfect we hit it off immediately on first contact having myself only traveled outside the west twice i still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time i do i am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls as i conversed with this well educated and refined young russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally i asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home . her answer was revealing boys they completely ignore the girls dont even look at them just walk on by . this really surprised her being a feminine russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her . men young boys in their prime s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day . according to wikipedia women against feminism started on tumblr in   i see womenagainstfeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society it is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage all you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect  i dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is . as men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions the very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left  here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational adjustment"}

a kid if i were told that id be writing a book about diet and nutrition when i was older i wouldve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind . living in newark new jersey my parents and i consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead rotting pig bodies although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean going through high school and college it was no different in fact my dietary change did not come until i was in my s . just to put things in perspective after i graduated from weequahic high school and before going to seton hall university i had a parttime job working for a butcher i was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store needless to say i had no consciousness nor awareness as change never came then despite the horrors i witnessed on an almost daily basis . after graduating with a degree in accounting from seton hall i eventually got married and moved to a town called livingston livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income to say it was a plastic community would be an understatement . livingston and the shallowness finally got to me i told my wife i was fed up and wanted to move she made it clear she had to be near her friends and new york city i finally got my act together and split for colorado . i was living with a lady in aspen at the end of  when one day she said  lets become vegetarians i have no idea what possessed me to say it but i said okay . at that point i went to the freezer and took out about  worth of frozen dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us . well everything was great for about a week or so and then the chick split with another guy . so here i was a vegetarian for a couple weeks not really knowing what to do how to cook or basically how to prepare anything for about a month i was getting by on carrot sticks celery sticks and yogurt fortunately when i went vegan in  it was a simple and natural progression anyway as i walked around aspen town i noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called the little kitchen . let me back up just a little bit it was april of  the snow was melting and the runoff of ajax mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud now aspen was great to ski in but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting . i was ready to call it quits and i needed a warmer place ill elaborate on that in a minute . but right now back to the little kitchen knowing that i was going to leave aspen and basically a new vegetarian i needed help so i cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook i told them in return i would wash dishes and empty their trash they then asked me what i did for a living and i told them i was an accountant . the owner said to me lets make a deal you do our tax return and well feed you as well so for the next couple of weeks i was doing their tax return washing their dishes emptying the trash eating three squares a day and learning as much as i could . but like i said the mud was getting to me so i picked up a travel book written by a guy named foder the name of the book was hawaii looking through the book i noticed that in lahaina on maui there was a little vegetarian restaurant called mr naturals i decided right then and there that i would go to lahaina and work at mr naturals to make a long story short thats exactly what happened . so im working at mr naturals and learning everything i can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great every afternoon we would close for lunch at about  pm and go to the sheraton hotel in kaanapali and play volleyball while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner . since i was the new guy and didnt really know how to cook i never thought that i would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner well one afternoon thats exactly what happened it was my turn that posed a problem for me because i was at the point where i finally knew how to boil water . i was desperate clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle fortunately there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and i asked him if he knew how to cook he said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas he said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless i told him that i had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about but i needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal . well the guys came back from playing volleyball and im asked what was for dinner i told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled i told him that mine were beanless and dairyless when he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible being the humble guy that i was i smiled and said you expected anything less it apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week in fact after about a week we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around lahaina broadcasting enchiladas at naturals tonight i never had to cook anything else . a year later the restaurant closed and somehow i gravitated to a little health food store in wailuku i never told anyone i was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver . the guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands i told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the state thats when they found out i was an accountant and down to earth was born down to earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands and i was their chief financial officer and comanager of their biggest store for  years . in  i started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures i still do that show today i pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty one bit of a hassle was the fact that i was forced to get a masters degree in nutrition to shut up all the mds that would call in asking for my credentials . my doing this radio show enabled me through endless research to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries the big pharmaceutical companies the biotech industries and the government agencies . this information unconscionable as it is enabled me to realize how broken our health system is . i left down to earth in  got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie after doing that for about four years i finally made it back to honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the honolulu club one of hawaiis premier fitness clubs . it was there i met the love of my life who i have been with since  she made me an offer i couldnt refuse she said if you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women so i went back into accounting and was the chief financial officer of a large construction company for many years . going back to my newark days when i was an infant i had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was my dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents it was by the grace of god that i was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness . the road that i started walking down in  has finally led me to the point of writing my book a sane diet for an insane world hopefully the information contained therein will be enlightening motivating and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices . doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow i am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities i have

fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc . earlier this week  and  shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials  and  say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters . i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year  explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot . in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots . after the report was first published and shared on facebook by  fairfax county democratic committee executive director  replied to s post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained . these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented  . that triggered a quick backandforth between  and  . i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope  said . like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network . impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied  . then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said  who should i believe you or my lying eyes .  then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives . i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded  . the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america  protested the premise of the story . please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated  in an email in which he also explained why he believed the  account could not be accurate . he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy . in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the  version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true . its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats . voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed . the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax . listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson . however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself . that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said . its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said .  is standing by her story  percent as is her husband  says its a very clear memory .  opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed  said . the coverage of s story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit . i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename . get the hottest most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just  seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts . another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones  and  shared last week . neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot . they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else . its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said . there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading  to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and  discovered with her ballot . i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that  said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues . neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true . i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said . he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight . i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and

{"label": "junksci", "text": "zika a masterpiece of public mind control . saturday october   by natural news editors tags zika  mind control  propaganda naturalnews its been nearly nine months since the word zika flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news before january   zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored but suddenly in january of this year everything changed as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threatarticle by john p thomas republished from healthimpactnewscom as we will see the zika propaganda machine was turned on in october of  and it has been running wild ever since this is a classic example of a mind control program a public brainwashing project or a high powered marketing campaignregardless of what you call it it is clear that the mainstream news media the world health organization who the pan american health organization paho the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc big pharma big chem and both republicans and democrats have joined forces to sell a zika eradication program to the people of the united states and to the rest of the worldthis has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history this article will discuss how the program started how it has been developed and where it is going zika is not a threat to the babies of the world just to be absolutely clear from the beginning there is no solid evidence that zika is a threat to humanity it is a minimally dangerous viral infection which does not cause microcephalyin the almost  years since the zika virus was patented by the rockefeller foundation  no one ever noticed any association between zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development but in  we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem this claim based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign a propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is trueafter half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media even officials in brazil admit that zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly as reported in nature news  comment on july   an official from brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country the report stated zika virus has spread throughout brazil but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast although evidence suggests that zika can cause microcephaly the clustering pattern hints that other environmental socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play we suspect that something more than zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases says fatima marinho director of information and health analysis at brazils ministry of health if that turns out to be true it could change researchers assessment of the risk that zika poses to pregnant women and their children  despite this admission from brazil the zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption the campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about zika and microcephaly zika is a mild viral infection most people who get zika will be completely unaware of being infected for those who do get sick it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu people experience fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon deaths are rare the fact that almost no one dies from zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine for those who actually feel sick from a zika infection they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness zika press releases set the stage for a propaganda campaign however if zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence such as microcephaly or paralysis guillainbarre syndrome for example then people would insist that we create a zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet earth take it they would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society which is always the goal of mind control programsin  a number of press releases and reports were released by the pan american health organization  world health organization pahowho and the cdc to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control projectthe documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a zika epidemic was unfolding throughout south america and mexico the conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly the prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audiencethe media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or zika is going to get us and our babies they worked really hard to instill public panic about zika in january and february of  in the timeline that follows you will see the word autochthonous public health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated an autochthonous case of zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives this is in contrast with a zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or countryi will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media may  brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly  november  el salvador guatemala mexico paraguay suriname and venezuela report autochthonous zika infection  november   who calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly  december   pahowho issued the first of dozens of reports which chronicled the history of the growing zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly   december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in honduras  december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in panama  december   us cdc reports autochthonous zika infections in puerto rico and makes note of microcephaly in brazil  counting babies with microcephaly the mainstream media suddenly picked up on the zikamicrocephaly story in january of  and began sensationalizing it general concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases as of january   they reported  cases of microcephaly andor central nervous system cns malformation suggestive of congenital infection they compared this with    data where there was an average of  microcephaly cases the brazil data about the babies was poor we didnt know their definition of microcephaly we didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for zika we didnt know how the data was collected we also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the zika virus propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted they dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts  they just want belief and submission the us propaganda machine goes public in january  cdc officials begin to ponder the situation first they say there might be an association between zika and microcephaly but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship good for them i thought when i heard that report but their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same cdc official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to brazil and other south american countries if they are pregnant think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple yearswhat did the cdc just say there is no evidence of causation and we dont even know there is even a problem but women should stay home any way strange i thought as i began to remember how the conventional media the cdc and the who hyped up the african ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just  months earlier the worldwide threat of ebola zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed which must have been a major disappointment to big pharmabut this time they have a virus that is not going to die out this time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as zika a false international crisis involving deformed babies justifies action all through january and early february of  the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about zika and deformed babies in a previous article i examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaignthe cdc was still using the word possible association while the news media insisted on using the word cause despite the initial reserve of the cdc the news media began to shout the message across america zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb and theres no vaccine to protect usit seems like every zika story i saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet we were reminded over and over again that zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads mental retardation and blindness we were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation we were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life  these stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to doas the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from zika it didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked what is the government going to do to protect our babies this question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that zika infection and microcephaly were related the question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say i am not going to do anything because as far as we know zika doesnt cause microcephaly president obama responds to the question on february   president obama requested  billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a zika vaccine lets look at this more carefully we are going to spend  billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects  just to be safe or is something else going on hereperhaps the real story is that big pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that big pharma develop a zika vaccine for us suddenly big pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world this would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off cdc declaration zika causes microcephaly the cdc announced in april of  that zika causes microcephaly this decision was based on a cdc analysis of available data they did not conduct comprehensive research they used a quacking duck kind of analysis if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck they couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck but they still insisted on calling it a duck named zika in doing this they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysiscdc researchers stated the seventh of shepards criterion proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents thus given shepards criteria as a framework criteria   and  have been satisfied  evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen  in other words they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly they determined that the association between zika infection and microcephaly was causative for  of the  criteria they suggested that additional study was needed before  of the other criteria could be met they excluded the seventh criteria altogether because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephalyi couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by zika infectionthese cdc scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents nothing else seemed to matter this exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the zika propaganda campaignthey ignored the effect of the tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in brazil in  they ignored the side effects of medications they ignored the consumption of gmo food glyphosate and pyriproxyfen that were widely used in brazil they ignored chemical exposure from brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities they ignored alcohol and drug use they ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty they ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in brazil they ignored exposure to rubella toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus they ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causesi discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on zika published in january of there is one key point that i want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly first we heard that there were some  cases of microcephaly in brazil after the initial shock and panic was produced we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only the mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the united states with microcephaly in a typical year is  when adjusting for population differences between the us and brazil we find that the rate of microcephaly in the us is actually  times higher than the rate in brazilin other words the us microcephaly incidence is much higher than brazil and our babies didnt get it from zika maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes i discussed in my previous articlei should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the cdc  i must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by cdc ties to big pharma the zika vaccine is in the pipeline based on this single poor quality analysis its full speed ahead for developing a zika vaccine there are at least four companies plus the cdc working on a zika vaccine we are told that it will still take several years before a zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the worldzika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the us the us national institutes of health hopes to start phase ii trials of its vaccine in early   congress tries to protect our babies with zika funding now that the cdc has settled the zikamicrocephaly question it was time to get congress to fund the presidents request for a zika vaccine development program the house and the senate passed zika funding bills however they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated the funding process stalled at the end of june when the senate and house could not reconcile their differences congress went on a seven week summer vacation and wasnt available to try to resolve their differences this created a problem for the zika mind control campaign because it might mean there would be no new zika news to report during the summer keeping the propaganda campaign going by killing mosquitoes the mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the aedes aegypti mosquito which is known to carry the zika virus if an infected mosquito bites a person then the person might develop the infection this is a fact that no one is disputing the great mosquito chase of  the cdc continues to count the number of zika cases in the us and puerto rico the numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer they were looking for autochthonous cases of zika in the us but they could only find infected people who had traveled to zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countriesfinally at the very end of july  people in the wynnewood section of miami florida were found to have zika even though they had not traveled to a zika infected country or had sex with a zika infected person public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites they ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure for example having sexual contact with an infected person nevertheless officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent zika from spreading any furthernow that the zika epidemic was on us home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign there are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies the governor of florida goes door to door to find more people with zika on august st the governor of florida contacted the us public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the zika emergency in miami these agents and florida officials went door to door in the wynwood neighborhood of miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of zika more cases were found but all were asymptomatic  the people didnt even know they were infected  problem  they cant find a zika infected mosquito  mosquitoes were tested for the presence of zika but all tests were negative officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack  aerial mosquito spraying program initiated the governor of florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide even though the aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than  feet from its birth place in the wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous zika cases were located the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe a spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media it would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone it also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that laterthe first aerial spraying took place on august    toxic pesticide used in aerial spraying causes microcephaly officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed because it naled is harmless they pointed to epa reports which supported their claim they didnt mention that naled was banned in europe in  they didnt mention that officials in puerto rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens they didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes  most importantly official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects  could pesticide naled cause microcephaly and other life threatening diseases officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of wynwood  was particularly dangerous for babies in the wombthis is what the journal of pesticide reform has to say about naled like all organophosphates naled dibrom is toxic to the nervous system symptoms of exposure include headaches nausea and diarrhea naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure in laboratory tests naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development in laboratory animals exposure for just  days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size  percent dichlorvos also causes cancer according to the international agency for research on carcinogens in laboratory tests it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children  emphasis added naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning these are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrumone of the most toxic break down products in naled is dichlorvos this chemical caused a  reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after  days of exposure another word for reduced brain size is microcephalyso the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant womenquestion if there are babies born in miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases will we blame zika or naled i am sure that no one from the cdc or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at naled they will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that zika is to blame naled is also harmful to adults dr naresh kumar a professor of public health at the university of miami commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying his statement came from cbs miami all are a neurotoxin meaning it will directly affect our nervous system it will affect not only the pregnant woman  it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days  the miami herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone they stated the agency epa says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying close windows and turn off window air conditioners fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered  so if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying then you should stay inside for  days until the pesticide falls out of the air you should keep your windows closed and turn off window air conditioners i wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of miami in augustmind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality they want us to follow their instructions which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying if you are concerned then you can take their ridiculous suggestions which wont really protect you from the spray does zika also cause guillainbarre syndrome apparently the cdc suspects that zika causes the paralytic syndrome called guillainbarre if you look at the data collection forms for monitoring zika in the us you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making they are counting cases of guillainbarre syndrome on the same form with cases of zika why would the cdc try to make this connection the cdc indicates on their guillainbarre syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome they do mention that there were some cases of guillainbarre syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in  but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology if they can make a case for the zika virus being the cause of guillainbarre syndrome then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysisi anticipate seeing a guillainbarre syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the cdc on microcephaly their new paper will just substitute the phrase guillainbarre syndrome for the word microcephaly they will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the zika virus is causative for guillainbarre syndrome as well as microcephalyif they can pull this off then the zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results if they can pull this off and i suspect they will then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the zika virus for microcephaly neurological malformation and paralysis that results from the use of their products the zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat the list of birth defects being blamed on zika with no evidence is increasing propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear first we heard that zika causes microcephaly then we heard that it might also cause guillainbarre syndrome now we are hearing that zika causes a whole host of other birth defects some of which might not appear until months or even years after birththe new york times stated the images of babies with microcephaly published tuesday in the journal radiology also suggest a grim possibility because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms the result of another common symptom zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally she dr levine said with such a vicious and unpredictable virus its key to realize that zika is more than microcephaly that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper and its effects are going to be even more broad said dr spong whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be  babies born in zika epidemic areas including brazil and puerto rico its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development to look at their ability to learn to look at hearing problems balance problems behavior problems all those issues to make sure that we dont miss anyone  zika the new scapegoat for all childhood diseases can you tell where this is going it seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from zika infectionit will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines pesticides gmo food pharmaceutical drugs the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard american diet and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against big pharma or big chem zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations it wasnt our product that harmed this little baby it was zika conclusion another government tool for the greater good to strip away freedoms it wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of us babies from florida who were born with microcephaly the mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the zika vaccine is developedwe will hear about more and more connections between zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children we will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the zika vaccinemind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms their rights and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit zika will be one of the tools used by mind controllers and the ruling elite to move us toward mass vaccination

{"label": "hate", "text": " wont vote with america at the un under  the united states wont defend the united states november    .  a  journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam . a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders . on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un . un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain  said . thank you she added acknowledging the applause . under  the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc . instead of defending america s chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy . let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said . if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador  if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc . the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a ful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable .    adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose . who is this we . the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors . this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one . one member of the we must be  because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed  to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america . no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states . we is  who made the final decision its ambassador  its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their  from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un . america has a we problem . if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country . when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work . these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists . thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works . the first word in the introduction to s presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i s basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi  is the state . jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  . the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master . in s directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack  there is no law only  . now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but  who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip  has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but  isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two ful political entities in america one is us the other is we . we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours . we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back . you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america . president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice . kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc . it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left . by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked . but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  . what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever . president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador  cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba . the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america

am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general  said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator  . this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added . at present under the  administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone . the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense . under a  presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed . michÃ¨le angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is s choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option . according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under   said she would direct us troops to push president  forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region . confirmed by the leaked emails  is a crony of the s she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces . according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the  administration has been willing to commit. since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington . flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone . the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general  and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything. senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing . what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage . secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything . senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  . secretary carter well okay . senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms . secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me . senator wicker im speaking about a  . secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing . let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add . general  senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president . senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped . general  all options  . senator wicker what do you think of that option sir . general  right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make . . concluding remarks . from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation . it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the  administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  . consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country . the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original source of this article is global research"}

not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites. no argument  this.  the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in  will be if in a contested swing state to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning. this is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result that is an obvious given however when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of likeminded individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo is arguably what occurred  the almost breakthrough candidacy of bernie saunders and it is also what happened in a dissimilar manner  the candidacy of donald   has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action and it is but individuals can and do at times form a wider consciousness measurable by statistically rigorous polling results that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the canadian federal election of  following two successive majority governments led by the brian mulroney tories a voting tsunami washed away all but two tory seats in the seat parliament the conservatives had been around since  but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the tories.  one of these candidates  denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point  has also pledged to deport  million mexican immigrants offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted african american protestors at his rallies stated his openness to using nuclear weapons supports a ban on muslims entering the us and regards the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood while having done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order  has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich hence shredding what remains of the social welfare safety net despite pretenses. much of what  stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man however  stakes out important positions diametrical to hillary clinton for example clintons advocacy of a nofly zone over syria her saber rattling  russia her corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals.  cleverly anticipated such an objection writing.   respect to point  which some will cnge by citing the claim that clintons foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of . in any case while conceding as an outside possibility that s foreign policy is preferable most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement furthermore insofar as this is the fact of the matter following the logic through seems to require a vote for  though its a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously. first  concedes an outside possibility that s foreign policy is preferable in other words  posits an inside possibility one assumes that  is saying that there is the strongest likelihood that clintons foreign policy is preferable out any substantiation of why this would be so second he raises an unreasonable demand for evidence that  will follow a less menacing foreign policy than clinton given that  has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume clinton would reduce the number of american military bases overseas or curtail military spending in fact it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about regime change in syria pushing the us closer to military confrontation  russia s detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to clintons rhetoric but toward putin or assad clintons undiplomatic utterances are on record. moreover following s logic while the more preferable policies of  lack evidence by the same token the more objectionable policies of  also lack evidence for the same reason  has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office thus following this ian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of s pronouncements would he really build a wall on the mexicous border where is the evidence for this would  really ban muslims from entering the us where is the evidence for this. by effectively undermining s peacemongering visÃ vis clintons warmongering  by the same logic undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by  thus following s logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously.  the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a clinton presidency. one assumes that  refers to the domestic population here s policies  if he is true to his word to protect jobs for american workers and punish offshoring of american jobs along  his opposition to the tpp  would be a political reversal for neoliberalization clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad the economic plight of students the poor and ill however would be much better under a jill stein presidency . the economic plight of students the poor and ill would be much better under a jill stein presidency. if  is referring to the preponderant violence of us foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations then i agree  his basic moral principle not only must we take responsibility for our actions but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves under the democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died millions of people have been displaced and terrorist organizations have proliferated this is the evidence from clintons time in political office thus a vote for clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation perhaps even a ramping up of the suffering of others basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppressionenabling vote.  should constitute sufficient basis to voting for clinton where a vote is potentially consequentialnamely in a contested swing state. i contend that s basis for  is false or questionable first  has staunchly argued that we should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over but it seems that  believes that  will supersede clintons record of killing in iraq libya and syria clinton is not going to close us military abroad  has called these bases into question and if one concentrates on the domestic population at least the rhetoric of  against socalled free trade agreements and offshoring us factories abroad bodes well for the american worker.  however the left should also recognize that should  win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a  administration. this criticism is antidemocratic furthermore the criticism applies conversely s citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the businessparty duopoly the records of the bill clinton and barack obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale clinton deregulated the finance sector exposed american workers to the vagaries of free trade implemented regressive welfare policies and continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing out the banks attempts to cut back social security warring in afghanistan libya yemen and syria drone strikes confrontation  russia and china tpp and the lingering incarceration at guantanamo bay it is important to note that democrats arguably have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than republicans have since many supporters of democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the republicans george bush was stymied from tinkering  social security notably obama has done an aboutface on social security and proposed an expansion picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the bernie saunders candidacy.  often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating cnges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it they will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels  the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left cnge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties  the political establishment rather than breaking  it as they must. it is true that establishment operatives will use lev as a bad faith justification for defeating cnges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it that was the case when ralph nader ran it is the case when cynthia mckinney ran and it is when jill stein runs the corporate media and even many socalled progressives will trot out this timeworn argument  each election cycle as long as enough people buy into the premise then the status quo will persist the result is that a rightwing government always assumes office in washington this bodes ill for the poor and working class it bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the us.  conclusion by dismissing a lesser evil electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for clintons defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve. conclusion by buying into a lesser evil electoral logic the corporatepolitical duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the  and their goals for further enrichment to unfetter finance to pursue a belligerent foreign policy  a policy that seeks to placate the militaryindustrial establishment and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system all of this is at crosshairs  what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve. final comments. the tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil. some leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism  i found that to be preposterous barack obama was the socalled lesser evil the previous two election cycles obama is not a lesser evilist he is the man who enables evil  the cycles of usbacked violence and killing in places such as gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen and somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism if one votes for a degree of evil then one should not be surprised when evil results. progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed a genuine peacemongering us president is needed to stop the killing and save lives consequently both democrats and republicans are anathema given the present candidates if people vote then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions. only a propeace third party will set the us on a new path  outside of a revolution the election of a propeace third party is the only moral

helping other men realize the dream of getting laid on the regular getting out of debt and traveling the world . facebook  twitter november   manosphere . there are those who think we should only get our news from official sources you know like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game . if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa . in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are . sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative . make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having  and  doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  . fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down . the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting . we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias . dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites . while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere . they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online . whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it . look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough . theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections . make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump . obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced . check out what the messiah said in berlin recently . in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems . the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government . we must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake internet  designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   by admin . by  . one thing i have yet to see anyone bring up is how this election could be bait and switch at the last minute in order to understand this however i need to explain the unique possibilities the nwo has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the s . first we have        therefore he must be better it is an argument based on the following  killed  million and one while mao killed  million and two so  is better than mao  is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate   already i have seen and heard more than enough about how if only  goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years . from the so called militia and patriots at awrm and the intelligence report they yammer that if only  goes in then we can postpone the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare after all they claim time favors us not the enemy all this bearing in mind that  has gone back on his word many times changed his mind flip flopped on illegals wants a bigger police state is the most hated in the media etc now lets compare the next runner up quickly .  it is currently chic to hate  youre not in style if you like her she will end the nation doom the world and so on never mind that both  and  were put up by the nwo you are not allowed to run otherwise this is old news she is going to cause more war she is a liar cheat she betrayed the nation etc yet both her and    behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly she is also the darling of the media . both of them have in common the s rise to power theme of  and  both take after these two for both nations germany and russia were in collapse or outright collapsed debauchery was the rule as well as corruption    she is going in red banners flying and the cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables she is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it  on the other hand is following s script offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government more powerful police state etc  will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist . now comes the problem people are not seeing if they force  in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash even insurrection should it be minor or full if they put  in then they are taking the back street approach  they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like obama did for a time this election is about purchasing time nothing more nothing less . if  is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum maybe eight the militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle dixie they are mortified of having to take action so  is their obvious choice  on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it the reality is time does not favor us here time favors the enemy if time favored us then we would not be here diminished and in dire straits imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during waco again time favored the enemy ruby ridge time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit they are not fools . consider those two possibilities then consider this if  goes in and goes along with the war with russia if indeed that is the plan for ww they laid out more than sixity years ago admittedly people are far more willing to join s army and go fight than they would  something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war put  in knowing it will cause an insurrection fake one which we know they can do have  reluctantly take the reins and like davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing a second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation but who would fight for  oh right thats why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops just change the uniform quickly and voila some would suggest this would favor the american nationals not really rather than fight intelligently for the bill of rights they would be fighting for  they would be fighting to bleed us dry like the confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly only by fighting by our own rules can we win  would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us remember the end game is to destroy absolutely the last vestiges of americans and our culture whatever may be left of it which  much if anything . perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of america will occur perhaps perhaps not but they now have the option to do so i want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up you while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles no matter what you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would never allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface i hope i scratched that surface for you like you they have a plan a b c and d it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries do not take them for the fool they have proven they are not . so maybe we will get  and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform cheka versus gestapo then again  might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase no matter what happens be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that  is honest they are both in on it together they merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal share this"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "s critical foreign tour israels strategic repositioning . originally published by the jerusalem post  . prime minister benjamin s upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup . next week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee  and republican nominee  are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past  years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president s decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory s decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover s willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel  reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the  islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the russian umbrella this then brings us to s upcoming trips each state that he will visit has something to offer israel in expanding its intelligence cyberwarfare and economic capabilities australia a major western economy is moving toward china as america has become less engaged in the pacific israel has an acute interest in using australia as a platform for expanding its ties to china and other asian countries both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to chinas strategic importance to russia as for singapore israel effectively built the singaporean military in the s and s the country remains extremely supportive of israel like australia singapore has close ties to china it has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for israel today azerbaijan and kazakhstan are critically important to israel today their strategic proximity to iran and their ties to russia along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to israels ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that  will visit these assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them given the dramatic changes in the global power balance and their implications for israel s decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the us elections tells us that he gets it at a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty in the context of swiftly multiplying threats this is no small matter"}

about the exorcism process as described by  in his controversial book hostage to the devil  part  of the article entitled the deceiver of the world is by  and continues where part  leaves off this reflects on various apocalyptic issues such as armageddon and the last days the problem of good and evil and the role of the jews in human history . the devils finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist   . why is it so hard to accept at least hypothetically that in the words of observant thinkers like  the devils finest trick is to convince us that he does not exist . it is generally accepted that the devil preys on human souls and what do predators do in all the settings natural political online they all use disguise and it shouldnt be beyond comprehension that the devil if he existed would use whichever cloak of invisibility was the most effective for the occasion therefore not seeing the devil or sensing his presence proves absolutely nothing . for those who are interested the material here comes from a book hostage to the devil  by father  a trained exorcist in the roman catholic tradition . fr s material featuring several cases of authentic demonic possession and their accompanying exorcisms in modern day america was carefully vetted through use of tape recorders and reinforced later on by lengthy interviews with the participants in the exorcism process    . in  in south africa  a   reportedly made a pact with the devil as a result her behavior suddenly took a bizarre turn for the worse in august of that year the startled nuns at the convent school where  was a student witnessed her tearing at her clothes growling like an animal and engaging in conversation with unseen entities . nuns reported that the girls skin would burn when sprinkled with holy water she would lash out violently when crosses or other sacred objects entered her presenceshe also reportedly developed clairvoyant powers and was able to describe personal details of other peoples lives that she couldnt possibly have known ab out . the accounts of several nuns also reported that  possessed the ability to speak and understand several different foreign languages to which she had never been exposed including polish german french and several others it was said that  had been imbued with superhuman strength as well easily overpowering authority figures at the school when they attempted to restrain her . another seemingly farfetched assertion from many witnesses was that  began levitating up to five feet in the air on a regular basis her clothes sticking to her body as if they too had managed to defy the laws of gravity it was claimed that only after being sprinkled with holy water could she be brought back down during which time she would also temporarily snap out of her possessed state . most outlandish of all were the claims that the young woman had the ability to transform into a sort of snakelike creature her body becoming as flexible as rubber as she slithered across the floor at one point she was said to have bitten a nun on the arm and left puncture marks like those of a serpents fangs . see here  . note this case history is not to be found in s hostage to the devil i have added it to the article as an afterthought since it contains within it many of the typical features found in demonic possession before you read any further please watch this minute video in spanish with english subtitles warning this article contains material that is deeply disturbing those of sensitive disposition are advised to refrain from further reading . apart from the quoted extracts randomly chosen among many to illustrate various aspect of possession or exorcism i wish to make the following points although the book deals only with cases in the catholic community demonic possession is a universal phenomenon and has been noted and researched in countries all over the world the possessor often referring to itself as the kingdom or in plural as we selects victims gripped in some spiritual emotional and intellectual conflict with the accepted mores of family society and church inserting itself undetected into these fault lines and exploiting them with catastrophic consequences loss of self identity soul or personality follows as a result there is invariably an element of guilt on the part of the victim who has initially invited possession by his or her aberrant behavior and life style in extreme cases the possessed individual has actually made a formal request for possession in order to gain some advantage eg worldly wealth or fame the process of expelling the possessing malignancy moves through identifiable stages . one of the most experienced exorcists i have known  notes who was in fact the mentor of the exorcist in the first case related in this book gave names to the various general stages of an exorcism these names reflect the general meaning or effect or intent of what is happening but not the specific means used by the evil spirit or by the exorcist conor as i call him spoke of six stages presence pretense breakpoint voice clash and expulsion  exorcism exacts practically intolerable toll on the priest in charge not infrequently resulting in his death at which point the junior helper must take over the task demonic possession is not an isolated or freak phenomenon it seems to be on the rise especially in the united states perhaps this has something to do with the demise of religious authority the proliferation of satanist covens child abuse and sacrifice the prevalence and glorification of satanist elements in pop culture and finally the wide acceptance and promotion of sexual perversion as a new norm . the incidence of exorcism fr martin begins by pointing out has been on a steady rise there has been a  percent increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early s and the mids over the same period there has been an alarming increase in the number of requested possessions  that is cases in which the possessed formally request satan to possess them  in comparison to the cases of incurred possessions which result from other sorts of activities of the possessed that facilitate possession . each year some  to  major exorcisms and some thousands of minor exorcisms are performed for experts in the field this is a sobering barometer of the increase in known cases of possession but it is still more sobering to realize how many more cases of possession cannot be addressed at all the thousands of letters i receive from people who are desperate for help  catholic protestant evangelical and unchurched  are eloquent anguished and a steadily mounting testimony to the crisis . law officers meanwhile are increasingly confronted on every side by the incontrovertible signs of crimes committed in the course of ritualistic satanism or as a grisly result of an individuals participation in such rituals they are very often left out of the shrunken loop of expert advice and assistance advice and assistance that was once routinely to be found . to those who are active in the field of exorcism and who therefore acquire a greater than usual ability to uncover and recognize the marks of ritualistic satanism for what they are it is clear that in many police precincts the satanist character of a crime is either relegated to the background or not mentioned at all  at least not in public reports . by and large the police have no other choice they have neither competence nor authority in the rarefied and dangerous field of satanist behavior most of the above points were made on numerous occasions in mythology and folklore eg vampires werewolves and the tale of dr faustus adapted by marlowe and goethe jesus christ was of course the grand exorcist not only in the gadarene swine incident but his opus seems to me to have been focused on confronting the devil in judaism for which he paid with his life  the tale does not end there in my view but i leave these speculative elements to the reader    the six stages of demonic possession . from the moment the exorcist enters the room a peculiar feeling seems to hang in the very air from that moment in any genuine exorcism and onward through its duration everyone in the room is aware of some alien presence  this indubitable sign of possession is as unexplainable and unmistakable as it is inescapable all the signs of possession however blatant or grotesque however subtle or debatable seem both to pale before and to be marshaled in the face of this presence . there is no sure physical trace of the presence but everyone feels it you have to experience it to know it you cannot locate it spatially beside or above or within the possessed or over in the corner or under the bed or hovering in midair . in one sense the presence is nowhere and this magnifies the terror because there is a presence an other present not a he or a she or an it sometimes you think that what is present is singular sometimes plural when it speaks as the exorcism goes on it will sometimes refer to itself as i and sometimes as we . this is reminiscent of the possessing entity in the gospel who when asked his name by jesus replied i am legion i am legion . invisible and intangible the presence claws at the humanness of those gathered in the room you can exercise logic and expel any mental image of it you can say to yourself i am only imagining this careful dont panic and there may be a momentary relief but then after a time lag of bare seconds the presence returns as an inaudible hiss in the brain as a wordless threat to the self you are its name and essence seem to be compounded of threat to be only and intensely baleful concentratedly intent on hate for hates sake and on destruction for destructions sake    . in the early stages of an exorcism  the evil spirit will make every attempt to hide behind the possessed so to speakto appear to be one and the same person and personality with its victim this is the pretense  . the first task of the priest is to break that pretense to force the spirit to reveal itself openly as separate from the possessedand to name itself for all possessing spirits are called by a name that generally though not always has to do with the way that spirit works on its victim . as the exorcist sets about his task the evil spirit may remain silent altogether or it may speak with the voice of the possessed and use past experiences and recollections of the possessed this is often done skillfully using details no one but the possessed could know it can be very disarming even pitiful it can make everyone including the priest feel that it is the priest who is the villain subjecting an innocent person to terrible rigors even the mannerisms and characteristics of the possessed are used by the spirit as its own camouflage . sometimes the exorcist cannot shatter the pretense for days but until he does he cannot bring matters to a head if he fails to shatter it at all he has lost perhaps another exorcist replacing him will succeed but he himself has been beaten every exorcist learns during pretense that he is dealing with some force or power that is at times intensely cunning sometimes supremely intelligent and at other times capable of crass stupidity which makes one wonder further about the problem of singular or plural and it is both highly dangerous and terribly vulnerable . oddly while this spirit or power or force knows some of the most secret and intimate details of the lives of everyone in the room at the same time it also displays gaps in knowledge of things that may be happening at any given moment of the present . but the priest must not be lulled by small victories or take chances on hopedfor stupidities he must be ready to have his own sins and blunders and weaknesses put into his mind or shouted in ugliness for all to hear he must not make excuses for his past or wither as even his loveliest memories are fingered by ultimate filth and contempt he must not be sidetracked in any way from his primary intention of freeing the possessed person before him and he must at all costs avoid trading abuse or getting into any logical arguments with the possessed the temptation to do so is more frequent than one might think and must be regarded as a potentially fatal trap that can shatter not only the exorcism but quite literally shatter the exorcist as well . accordingly as the pretense begins to break down the behavior of the possessed usually increases in violence and repulsiveness it is as though an invisible manhole opens and out of it pours the unmentionably inhuman and the humanly unacceptable there is a stream of filth and unrestrained abuse accompanied often by physical violence writhing gnashing of teeth jumping around sometimes physical attacks on the exorcist    . a new hallmark of the proceedings enters as the breakpoint nears and ushers in one of the more subtle sufferings the exorcist must undergo confusion complete and dreadful confusion rare is the exorcist who does not falter here for at least a moment enmeshed in the peculiar pain of apparent contradiction of all sense . his ears seem to smell foul words his eyes seem to hear offensive sounds and obscene screams his nose seems to taste a highdecibel cacophony each sense seems to be recording what another sense should be recording each nerve and sinew of onlookers and participants becomes rigid as they strive for control panicthe fear of being dissolved into insanityruns in quick jabs through everyone there all present experience this increasingly violent and confusing assault but the exorcist is the one who rides the storm he is the direct target of it all . the breakpoint is reached at that moment when the pretense has finally collapsed altogether the voice of the possessed is no longer used by the spirit though the new strange voice may or may not issue from the mouth of the victim in thomas wus case the alien voice did come from the possesseds mouth and that was why the police captain was so startled the sound produced is often not even remotely like any human sound . at the breakpoint for the first time the spirit speaks of the possessed in the third person as a separate being for the first time the possessing spirit acts personally and speaks of i or we usually interchangeably and of my and our or mine and ours . another very frequent sign that the breakpoint has been reached is the appearance of what father conor called the voice  . the voice is an inordinately disturbing and humanly distressing babel the first few syllables seem to be those of some word pronounced slowly and thicklysomewhat like a tape recording played at a subnormal speed you are just straining to pick up the word and a layer of cold fear has already gripped youyou know this sound is alien but your concentration is shattered and frustrated by an immediate gamut of echoes of tiny prickly voices echoing each syllable screaming it whispering it laughing it sneering it groaning it following it they all hit your ear while the alien voice is going on unhurriedly to the next syllable which you then try to catch while guessing at the first one you lost by then the tiny jabbing voices have caught up with that second syllable and the voice has proceeded to the third syllable and so on . if the exorcism is to proceed the voice must be silenced it takes an enormous effort of will on the part of the exorcist in direct confrontation with the alien will of evil to silence the voice the priest must get himself under control and challenge the spirit first to silence and then to identify itself intelligibly . as in all things to do with exorcism of evil spirit the priest makes this challenge with his own will but always in the name and by the authority of jesus and his church to do so in his own name or by some fancied authority of his own would be to invite personal disaster merely human power unadorned and without aid cannot cope with the preternatural it is to be remembered that when we speak of the preternatural we are not speaking about what are known as poltergeists . usually at this point and as the voice dies out a tremendous pressure of an obscure kind affects the exorcist this is the first and outermost edge of a direct and personal collision with the will of the kingdom the clash  . we all know from our personal experience that there can be no struggle of single personal wills without that felt and intuitive contact between two persons there is a twoway communication that is as real as a conversation using words the clash is the heart of a special and dreadful communication the nucleus of this singular battle of wills between exorcist and evil spirit    . painful as it will be for him the priest must look for the clash he must provoke it if he cannot lock wills with the evil thing and force that thing to lock its will in opposition to his own then again the exorcist is defeated . the issue between the two the exorcist and the possessing spirit is simple will the totally antihuman invade and take over will it noisome and merciless seep over that narrow rim where the exorcist would hold his ground alone and engulf him or will it unwillingly protestingly under a duress greater than its singletrack will stop identify itself cede retire disappear and be volatilized back into an unknown pit of being where no man wants to go ever . even with all the pressure on him and in fullest human agony if the exorcist has got this far he must press home he has gained an advantage he has already forced the evil spirit to come out on its own if he has not been able to until now he must finally force it to give its name and then some exorcists feel the exorcist must pursue for as much information as he can for in some peculiar way as exorcists find the more an evil spirit can be forced to reveal in the clash and its aftermath the surer and easier will be the expulsion when that moment comes to force as complete an identification as possible is perhaps a mark of domination of one will over another . it is of crucial interest to speculate about the violence provoked by exorcismthe physical and mental struggles that are so extreme they can bring on death why would spirit battle so why not leave and waft off invisibly to someone or someplace else for spirit itself seems to suffer in these battles . time and again in exorcism after exorcism there occurs that curious thing to do with spirit and place the strange puzzle mentioned previously in connection with the room chosen for the exorcism when jesus expelled the unclean spirits those spirits showed concern for where they might go in record after record as well as in several exorcisms recounted in this book the possessing spirits wail in lament and questioning pain where shall we gowe too have to possess our habitationeven the anointed one gave us a place with the swinehere    we cant stay here any longer . evil spirit having found a home with a consenting host does not appear to give up its place easily it claws and fights and deceives and even risks killing its host before it will be expelled how violent the struggle probably depends on many things the intelligence of the spirit being dealt with and the degree of possession achieved over the victim are perhaps two one could speculate about . whatever determines the actual pitch of violence once the exorcist has forced the invading spirit to identify itself and sustained the first wordless bout of the clash and then invoked its formal condemnation and expulsion by the exorcism rite the immediate result is generally a struggle tortuous beyondimagining an open violence that leaves all subtlety behind . the person possessed is by now obviously aware in one way or another of what possessed him frequently he becomes a true battleground for much of the remainder of the exorcism enduring unbelievable punishment and strain . it is sometimes possible for the exorcist to appeal directly to the possessed person urging him to use some part of his own will still free of the spirits influence and control and engage directly in the fight aiding the exorcist and at such moments no animal pinned helplessly to the ground struggles more pathetically against the drinking of its lifes blood by a voracious and superior cruelty the very nauseous character of the possessed persons appearance and behavior appears to be a sign of his desire for deliverance a desperate sign of struggle evidence of a revolt where once he had consented . increasingly what had possessed him is being forced into the open all the while protesting its victims revolt and its own expulsion the violence of the contortions and the physical disfigurement of the possessed can reach a degree one would think he could not possibly withstand . the exorcist too comes in for full attack now once cornered the evil spirit seems able to call on a superior intelligence and will try to lure the exorcist on to a field boobytrapped and mined with situations from which no human can extricate himself . any weakness in the religious faith that alone sustains the exorcist or any fatigue will allow the exorcists mind to be flooded with a terrible light he cannot fend offa light that can burn the very roots of his reason and turn him emotionally into the most servile of slaves desperate to be liberated from all bodily life . these are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist his pain is physical emotional mental he has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling with something askew but intelligently so with a quality that is upside down and inside out but significantly so the mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission . he is attacked by a stench so powerful that many exorcists start vomiting uncontrollably he is made to bear physical pain and he feels anguish over his very soul he is made to know he is touching the completely unclean the totally unhuman  the totally unhuman  click to expand  . all sense may suddenly seem nonsense hopelessness is confirmed as the only hope death and cruelty and contempt are normal anything comely or beautiful is an illusion nothing it seems was ever right in the world of man here is an atmosphere as bizarre as bedlam . if in spite of his emotions and his imagination and his bodyall trapped at once in pain and anguishif in spite of all this the will of the exorcist holds in the clash what he does is to approach his final function in this situation as an authorized human witness for jesus . by no power of his on account of no privilege of his own he calls finally on the evil spirit to desist to be dispossessed to depart  and to leave the person possessed . and if the exorcism is successful this is what happens the possession ends . all present become aware of a change around them the sense of presence is totally suddenly absent . sometimes there are receding voices or other noises sometimes only dead silence . the recently possessed will wake up as if from a dream a nightmare a coma sometimes he will remember much of what he has been through sometimes he will remember nothing at all    many people could be demonically possessed without knowing it here are two individuals who in my opinion might benefit from the ministrations of a good exorcist is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have said so click here for a spooky minute video is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have thought so apart from the demonic expression that disfigures her face this woman preaches white genocidethe total destruction of the european race what more do you have to do to qualify for demonic possession see here for more details on barbara spectres psychopathy and compare the expression on her face with figure  of this illustration from a medical textbook on demonic possession   as i wrote in a recent email to  i feel that the entire tribe of judah is demonically possessed they always have been for centuries jesus made that point over and over again in his homilies and clearly the jews works bear that out they are now the devils agents on earth to promote his policies and spread contagion

home to the united states or europe the guys will be jealous the women will feel threatened and your bride will be a fish out of waterfor a while but it doesnt take them long to get established she will find a group of her countrywomen other thais vietnamese or ukrainians they will teach her the ropes where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs the most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home where her fellow countrymen hang out and oh yes they will also learn american culture their friends will explain about american men and american divorce law and that is where the trouble starts. my vietnamese war bride an upscale frenchified thing informed me after just over a year of marriage after i had helped her family escape saigon that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle when the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court losing she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table. keep your woman in her own country where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men you make the adjustment to her culture instead of vice versa why american culture is about the most poisonous in the world almost anything is better countries that havent been indoctrinated in feminism and cultural marxism still value children and respect a womans role in bearing them and raising them they also respect a mans role as the breadwinner and head of the family. i committed myself to ukraine nine years ago met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago it is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in kyiv instead of the usa.  kyiv is a beautiful and lively city beautiful architecture  andreevska church. kyiv is a worthy capital city it has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments there are many many targets for a tourist camera the walled city was built to be defensible situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the dnieper river close to where the desno river joins from the east  miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia. the sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isnt frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of ones choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters. the soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride. young people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafÃ©s and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city. kyiv is home to ukraines most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit  an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states.  ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course. kyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in donbass prices have risen especially for imports but not nearly as much the tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for  a taxi anywhere in the city for  and a meal for under  that is just the start. for those of us who live here  metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient try the grocery store a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states  a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars. medical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much in fact ukraine is a medical tourism destination especially for fertility treatments plastic surgery and dental work. an american social security check makes you rich by local standards it is a good place to live in retirement moreover any american can teach english and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start.  ukrainians are fairly uniformly slavic  and they like people like themselves just us slavs. western newspapers are full of horror stories about ukraine  war and corruption leaders in moscow washington and europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the west im no fan of corruption but given the fact that it is universal it is worth relating why ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the europe or the united states. there is no hypocrisy about our corruption or rather the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies the virtue we still have free speech ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect they are not jailed if they say what they think about middle eastern immigration if you tell a woman she looks good she might actually blush and appreciate it. the corruption has kept the standard of living low which perversely has important benefits people remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare. not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital the people actually like and trust each other i am the only american in our little development of  homes they have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when i meet them on the street in the bus and in the stores in my toney neighborhood of bethesda maryland most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly. the fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc. people always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian. lastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you cant blame it on the drivers.  young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting. students and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called squaredelightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one you have something of substance. there are lots of places to meet young people needless to say bars and nightclubs there are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs the english language mafia club is thriving the toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in english german russian and ukrainian the language exchange club also meets in several languages from may to september the river beaches are great surrounded by restaurants bars and discos. ukrainians love to practice their english and welcome foreigners not too many make it this far east it is an easy place to make friends.  it is a good place to sit out the wests coming civil unrest one of kyivs many lovely river beaches. the western press would have you believe that kyiv is a lawless wild west that is the opposite from the truth  even today it is safer than any western capital city. the first danger cited is vladimir putin when are the russians going to invade answer they wont throughout is history russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity they stopped when finland fought back in  and georgia fought back in  they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because the red army conveniently occupied them at the end of world war ii. in ukraine they took the opportunity of political chaos in  to steal crimea where by treaty they already had a large military presence emboldened they thought they had an opportunity in the russianspeaking donbass but the ukrainians resisted and that war is at a standstill putin knows full well that  million ethnic russians cannot dominate  million ethnic ukrainians especially under the glare of world opinion despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the us election the russians are not coming another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking it is a benefit of staying out of nato. there is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits hardship is already here there are no discontented minorities gypsies the most visible of them actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers you cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck it is the united states and europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them. ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody as much as they complain people know how to cope with it it may take bribery to get things done but they generally do get done corruption does not result in much violence occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off true but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted it is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the united states or random islamic terror in western europe. ukraine has lots of land excellent agriculture abundant water reasonably good natural resources and a homogeneous and hardworking population it is not as dependent on international trade as most european countries when the world financial system collapses ukraine will come through looking pretty good they are so far down that it all looks like up and the stress lines for civil unrest simply dont exist though you may come here for the love of a wonderful woman you will find it a delightful place to make your home. read more ukrainian girls have lost their love for american men"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "email . queen  ii is not like you and me . did you know she is immune from prosecution that she has her own personal poet paid in sherry wine or that she holds dominion over british swans and can fire the entire australian government . its true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority . and she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre . most famously she owns all swans in the river thames . technically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family . today this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population . its a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker . the swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website . rule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters . the queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king  according to time . according to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by  . the law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen . the queen can drive without a licence . driving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time . despite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes . queen  ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral . former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen . cowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead . unlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times . she has two birthdays . when youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  . official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint . both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers . for her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade . she has her own private cash machine . less a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks . the queen has her own personal poet . the poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry . carol ann duffy will hold the position until  . she has to sign laws . the queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  . royal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament . queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition . it has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  . she can create lords . the queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers . she doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway . the queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  . the queen has the power to form governments . unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi . the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up . she does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so . this caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties . in this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message . at one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported . she has knights . sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally . knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite . the individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval . she is exempt from freedom of information requests . all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future . she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis . while the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains . the queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government . as the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown . kerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since . in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu . all the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day . shes the head of a religion . queen  ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century . her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission . an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen  ii dies . she gets to give away special money to the elderly . maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners . the coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation . shes also immune from prosecution . all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court . in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable . although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy . if the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed . the queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers . assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister . the queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds . hungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual . the owner of sauchlemuir castle must set out three glasses of port on new years eve for the grandmother of james iv of scotland for reference james iv

him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you. you see s power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for  they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment. so what can be done to stop him  . well lets ask ourselves what makes  popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different. so if that is what gives  strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone. theyve claimed nonstop that  is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots. . instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama. that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call  ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos. yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements. . at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead. why havent his opponents used this against him . this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks. no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint  as sex offender only made it easier for  to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  . . attacking  for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness. this means that in order to draw voters away from  they would have to claim  loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues. . using this strategy against  even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war. . the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders. to put it simply the battle was lost even before  came was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back. the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power. as one wise commenter on this site once said   may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies. the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be like figures who will copy s rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war . read

their primal nature . learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter  november   mind . we modern men need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us while the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy we must embrace strength and discipline while whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies towards this end i propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible . the following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths  stress . although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you new studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges . so next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing remember that it is your friend you must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you by changing how you processes stress you can use it to succeed in life  obstacles your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are . whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger like stress its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life you need to get out and start doing more things . how you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see so dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead be determined to rise above it your honor is at stake  failures . failures are inevitable in life although you should always try your best to succeed you shouldnt be afraid to fail either just as with obstacles view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt its not failure itself that is bad but not learning from it or giving up so easily remember winners dont quit they try to do better  rejection . rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not i would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time as long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again you will grow master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men  physical discomfort this is why russians are so tough . its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them the more harshness you endure the stronger you become over time but inversely the more comfortable you are the softer you turn and the weaker you get . one simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers the benefits of doing it are many including stronger immune system enhanced mood and energy better circulation boost in testosterone level and so on if you are having trouble getting started start by doing just  seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there you want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes  fear . you cant really turn fear itself into a positive but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life some of the proudest most exciting and memorable moments of my life were when i defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people i had a terrible stagefright going rock climbing i have a terrible fear of heights and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country . one thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all  anger . like fear anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities but ive never had it work that way however it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic it can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation . no matter how unpleasant your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it it will reveal your weaknesses insecurities and any other areas of your life in need of improvement as one of the most base and primal of human emotions you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead make it your friend  negativity and pessimism . for the longest time i felt guilty about being so negative because i was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing smile they said think positively they said your life will improve they said i was constantly berated for not being part of the north american positivity cult its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit i have yet to fix . but in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life studies have shown just the opposite forced positivity can actually harm you  for some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse also badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages be healthier live longer be better at negotiating and more successful overall in life so if youre a natural grouch like me its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass positivity people to shove it conclusion . the road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one i honestly cant say that i enjoy it but no matter what i know that it is a necessary part of being a man i cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties i refuse to live a life of complacency some people mock and insult our efforts  but know that their opinions dont matter lesser men have no say on what it means to live so fight on and prosper for this is your one and only life"}

hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september    comments .  tx  an intelligent and talented th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school yearold  is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices he can even repair his own gokart . recently he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers sadly instead of celebrating his achievement one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb . when the police arrived they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well even though it obviously wasnt eventually the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it . the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of . here in high school none of the teachers know what i can do  told dallas news after the incident . he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created he was warned not to show it to the other teachers . he was like thats really nice i would advise you not to show any other teachers  said . he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher after the class  showed his teacher what was making the noise and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school . she was like it looks like a bomb he said . i told her it doesnt look like a bomb to me he explained . the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it however towards the end of the day  was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers . he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb . they were like so you tried to make a bomb   said . i told them no i was trying to make a clock . the officer then told him  it looks like a movie bomb to me . the police even admit that  never once said the device was a bomb and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something even though they didnt have any proof . we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb he kept maintaining it was a clock but there was no broader explanation police spokesman james mclellan said . it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car the concern was what was this thing built for do we take him into custody he added . they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers . they thought how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat  said . s father mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against . he just wants to invent good things for mankind but because his name is mohamed and because of sept  i think my son got mistreated he said . there has since been an outpour of support on social media since s story

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "by  . i begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress the underground . there is a media metaphysics its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it in other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a userconsumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event . information can be dressed up a thousand different ways but it tends to have an elastic quality by that i mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press they expose themselves even though they dont want to it takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation this is happening now right in front of our eyes . the basis of big media is theater news is theater its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job but theyre sadly mistaken gaps and obfuscations are growing larger the outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent the audience is wising up to the farce who are these fools who direct the news theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer but that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall . globalized media its nice plan lets examine it . the new technocratic media is based on profiling users there is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants . shocking its to be expected how else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumersusers . several years ago i wrote tech blather has already begun since  ceo of amazon bought the washington post at a fire sale  will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the post a smashing success mobile devices multiple platforms digital taking over from print ads customized to fit readers interests profiling news stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling . in other words nonnews if you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you havent seen anything the new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms . the tech giant apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users yahoo apple news part of the upcoming ios  operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iphone and ipad apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests joshua benton of the nieman journalism lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league this news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within  hours of its debut . translation profiling their users down to their toenails apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read . not just one overall presentation for all no different news outlets for apples audiences . this introduces a whole new layer of mind control . youre an obama fan here are stories confirming your belief in the prophet . you want neocon on the rocks with a conservative republican twist heres some war footage thatll warm your heart . do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern congress cant get anything done weve got headlines for that from here to the moon . tuned into celeb gossip heres your world in three minutes . the idea convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important is the news of the day . its decentralized centralization one media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops . and for fringe users youre doubtful about gmos well look at what whole foods is planning for their healthier produce section cheer up nothing about maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic monsantodow experiments or the dangers of roundup youre antivaccine sorry you dont count youre not a recognized demographic but heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the i . does this sound like science fiction it isnt its the mainstream look of the nearfuture search engines are already personalizing your inquiries us abc national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories and spending less time on thorny issues like the middle east . the mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer . mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth . hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands . the onetwo punch . any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences . who cares what really happened in the new world there is no what really happened thats a gross misnomer a faulty idea a metaphysical error no there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities . in   orwells big brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population that was oldschool that was primitive technology that was achieving unity by hammering unity into peoples skulls this now is the frontier of unity through diversity . we want to make all of you into androids through basic pr and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education however we recognize youll become different varieties of androids and well serve that outcome with technological sophistication trust us we care about what you prefer . user a wow did you see the coverage of the border war in chula vista . user b war they had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there at least a hundred different types and then i watched an old ww movie about aerial combat . user c chula vista they had a great food show this woman made a lemon pie i could practically taste it . user d that wasnt a border war it was a drill and then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear vests shields communication devices flashbangs auto rifles with silencers batons i watch drills all over the country love them . user e chula vista the only thing i saw on the news was sunny and mild this week i watch all the weather channels i love them . but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone . one problem though major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by wikileaks and project veritas this attack has exposed the truth and the clinton crimes . and alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts . the technocratic plan for the news is failing . it was a nice plan but . its turning out to be a dud . alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another hillaryobama support for isis provaccine liars the collapse of obamacare the gmo hustle pesticide damageon and on and on . the result major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for everyone all the time the idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing . major media are playing defense against the rest of the world . its quite a party . and it has no expiration date . a final note trump wikileaks project veritas drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in  raining down on major media it was and is unprecedented the mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before the lying the

{"label": "hate", "text": "firearms panics happen over a variety of things like acts of domestic terrorism mass shootings or democrats getting elected to office though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after nd amendment enthusiast s decisive victory last night lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future democrats are elected. what is a panic for ammo and firearms a panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items but maybe not to own them already as most americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the constitution. adding to a panic is speculators who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices only to resell privately at much higher levels while this is legal it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity. lastly the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand nor can the manufacturer and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels. some prices never return  long rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old  the islamic shock  did to it with his multiyear championship of best firearms salesman ever and it may be even worse under the bitch in chief. so what gets grabbed in a panic what should you get what should you count on still being available weve got three categories guns ammo and componentsaccessories. guns anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban so its a first target for a panic look for things that are popular with the right and scary to the left also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the m garand anytime soon. evil features matter more than destructive power anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the ak and the ar fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots however theyre black and have mean things attached to them so theyre on the shit list while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an ar can pull is safe as it looks traditional. . they have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the fal and anything based of the ghk action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted unless they pull something sweeping like the usc  r rules again the mini  and the ma might be safe maybe. for pistols pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned oftentimes stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed s hi powers other old domestic semiautos and revolvers should be safe expect the libtards to go after glocks and the like. shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length i think the saigas are still not being imported and its about the only box mag fed one out there but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well. ammunition range full metal jacket and defensehunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and  long rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online and its probably beginning as i write this. oddly enough only certain rounds will suffer panic buying for rifles its limited to   and  traditional hunting rounds like   and  do not seem to be impacted why doesnt  get bought in a panic as the old joke goes men with s dont panic but it really has to do with the feedback cycle i mentioned at the start if theres little demand it cannot exceed the instore supply so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur. everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic. panic bought pistol ammo is the big  mm luger  sw and  acp  will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds and there usually is a bit of a run on  magnum and  special as well mm  sig  gap and other magnums like the  do not seem to be affected. for rimfires  long rifle just goes poof while its magnum brother and smaller  caliber cousins do not seem to be as affected rimfires are not reloadable and this contributes to their overstockpiling. components and accessories most centerfire ammo is reloadable and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy selfreliance and performance so the consumable components will also get some panics although ive held off on reloading articles until i get my press set back up we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly. . biggest thing is primers even bigger than the bullets oddly enough the primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges and they come in two sizes for pistols two for rifles and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications. the second is gunpowder itself fortunately theres a wide variety of smokeless powder and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers the third is the bullets and since there are so many types and manufacturers they also take a little less of a hit than primers while you obviously need all three to reload bear that in mind always save your brass and anyone elses you can pick up. even though the little ones are easier to use the higher capacity ones disappear first get both. while it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine especially high capacity ones i dont mean the  round drum mags although those do take a dive nor do i really mean the  round coffin mags but i mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags like a  round mag for a full sized pistol or a  round ar mag expect to see pmags and surplus style aluminum ar mags just vanish the gabby giffords special the extended glock   round mag is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic. holsters slings cleaning accessories optics and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics. what to do if you already own a carbine andor a semiauto pistol make sure you have enough ammo magazines and spare parts its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo. i try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles get some rifle mags of different sizes the  and  ar mags are fun for shooting standing up but they get in the way of prone firing and the  and  rounders are preferable. your ultimate ammo goal i maintain should be a thousand practice rounds and  defense rounds for each gun you have but in a prepanic or panic situation just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none if youre into reloading you know what to get already. if you dont own anything and want to soon refer to some pistol articles  a rifle article a shotgun article and a buying guide here consider buying some stripped ar lowers to build on a rainy day later on. build an ar and meet girls at the range. conclusion no matter who got elected i think this country is in for rough times its always better to have firearms and not need them then not have them and need them store yours safely but accessible and ready in times of need . read more  firearms a man should own"}

politics . next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse well pick the next president at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts and well either brace for government mandated sjw enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people but today i want to talk on  once to match an article from last week and i intend to focus on how he is the american candidate as opposed to the special interest groups one . i had a conversation last week with some people who acted as sjws but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting  and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time i learned that their perspective was unless you were universally for all special interest groups you were a bigot or a racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare . the problem i found out was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation either you want all refugees here from the middle east all the hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around or youre a racist theres simply no middle ground . they dont understand that  is not a special interest candidate by which i mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense but he is not racist towards minorities or sexist towards women . it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat americans of hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of women yet still value american women as americans themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cops and bad and good black people . the american dream is that all men are created equal and thats men as in humanity not just males it is not that all men are equal and theres a big difference to note here you have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and i do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled . what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot real or imagined so that things will be better they take from the producers and give to the nonproducers so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their lives the good of the country over that of the individual . long gone are responsible democrats like kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressmen view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups  is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks or the gays or the muslims or the feminists or whatever and that matters a lot . the reason why not being for a special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote womens vote gay vote etc is so important is that these groups even put together do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country dont get me wrong theres plenty of good hardworking black people just like theres the same for women and for gays and for young people but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because theyre too busy being productive americans activism is for unemployed people . whats going to happen if we dont placate blm and just ignore them they riot a bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals theyd quit rioting . what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made a straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanics that wanted to be citizens what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and its your choice to not learn it but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you theyd be americans proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well . what would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law and have the same rights as everyone else but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right . what if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits theyd be normal americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces . what would happen if we talked to muslims and said that there is a huge deafening silence when it comes to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help means supporting us vetting muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem not hating a people . what would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters that of merit that of excellence . what if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and when you do that to the majority of men youll be just as successful and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past theyd realize that its not a competition its a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex . what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy on rights for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other as americans and put us all of us first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limits a reality for congress maybe we could get a government for

{"label": "bias", "text": " things you need to know about sanctuary cities by  november   . with  elected to the presidency one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens the issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the republican primary when  decried the murder of  by an illegal alien in san francisco a sanctuary city . in response to the election of  leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities .  sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as   former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains  usc section  deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states . the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  . much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials .  and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law .  sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather  in  . we cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals . in that  piece  documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well .  sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their  released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens . but the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to  twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as  of outstanding murder warrants . additionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in  sanctuary cities shielded  illegals from deportation  percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and  of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review . there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year  of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk . according to vaughn  from january  to september   sanctuary cities rebuked over  detainers  percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history . based on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that .  crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry . according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation . landry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status . using recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in  violent crime up  percent homicides up  percent shooting victims up  percent rapes up  percent robberies up  percent and aggravated assault up  percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base . this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime  .  there are an estimated  sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here  do you live in a sanctuary

{"label": "bs", "text": " . censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising   and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted . facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown . and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case . recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of ? kim phÃºc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang . that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image . ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader  arrest . but taking down of the image of kim phÃºc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  . trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters . in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division  admitted it had been a mistake . according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives . in addition to sky global policy chief  government relations chief  vice president for public policy and communications  and facebook chief operating officer  make the final call on censorship and appeals . all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others . company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand . for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors . indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification . although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error . in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences . earlier this year an exposÃ© by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots . however considering  and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative . in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part . and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids . after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives . senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  . in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards . while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users

{"label": "hate", "text": " views share by dr  when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of c and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member  author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist  and  an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud . for years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that  the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of  if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of  and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as  saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians s official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell  told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael  the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial

most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure clustering of northern and southern populations  michael

and admixture following the emigration of sephardic jews during the inquisition finally this study added  these populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger ashkenazi and

group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race ostrer also deals specifically with the khazar theory he pointed out that the findings from the jewish hapmap project see below completely refute the theories that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of converted khazars or slavs  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post    the jewish hapmap project  a joint project of albert einstein college of medicine and new york university school of medicine was created to understand the structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to middle eastern iraqi and iranian jews this genetic split seemed to have

study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian  in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    s single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of  from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against which any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist  who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk gÃ¼nther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by

provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check     responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when  made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v   decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the  ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so  is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet    ruling her spokesman    believes  was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally  made this point evident during the debate when she  her disagreement with the  decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know  centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in  is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned

false indeed  s claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under s policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade s plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst   under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check     claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim  often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows s claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year  first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method  used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so  and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check     praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check      we at the  foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of

filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of  cash  the  foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer  last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the  foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of

foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia . no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth . in   and a formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest . according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  a is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account . at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight . for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations .  previously served as president s chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president  and now chairs s campaign . a acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for s campaign . think about that for a moment . one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the  campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities . as the washington post reported months ago in july as lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund . the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger  to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then as fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution . notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict . additionally as status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former  foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders . hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising . i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon . to which general counsel to the  campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added . responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for  . as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds . where do we draw the line though . elias suggests a particularly intricate solution . if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically . put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen . as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground . mook eventually decides plainly . marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat  actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that . all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  . as specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine . saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying . that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt  campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well . as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee s campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign . although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts . the system isnt rigged  its performing exactly as intended  and always will as long as the vote validates its existence dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter

comments . asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl . the video shows a short interaction between yearold      the woman who took the video  approached police as they were arresting her brother   apd they had a warrant for s arrest . she was asking them why are  arresting my brother  said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them . the video apparently shows the aftermath of this questioning as the officer grabs  and throws her to the ground .  police  yelled at officers and allegedly reached into her brothers pockets to retrieve his personal items as he was being arrested s actions then caused officers to have to deal with her the video is the result of  apparently being dealt with .  police  was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt  who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official . i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal   kasees mother  news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police be the incident to tell them that  had just gotten out of the icu . she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal  but  are not listening they were not listening . you wonder why people are running around here saying black lives matter she continues thats why because they really dont think our lives matter because he could have pulled her to the side talked to her he didnt even do none of that .  police they were there for another incident but when they saw  they decided to arrest him too . the asheville police department released the following statement . the asheville police department has viewed the video circulating on social media regarding the arrest of a yearold female on the evening of september   . the nine second video is only a small portion of a much longer incident . the asheville police department is in the process of conducting a full administrative investigation that will review all evidence including the video circulating on social media and body worn camera footage in our review . the asheville police department is dedicated to providing the best possible police service and upon completion of the review will take appropriate action if deemed necessary . anyone with additional video footage or information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact our professional standards office at   .  news  when they requested the body cam video from the scene that night they were denied rist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share google  keysbum . ooooh the adrenaline rush that brave heroic cop must have enjoyed after overpowering that dangerous villainous little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi . the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo . this is not about black  it is about getting involved in a legal arrest  razedbywolvs . no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael . she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard . now why was he being arrested bruismenot . what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly . i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot . unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member . its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back . have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized . cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops . also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly . hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless . lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder . since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve . you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create . httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot . i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly . and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible . all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot . i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get . lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly . i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance be calling a cop any day . your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa . httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey . your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot . sure arrest all the cops then whose going to keep all the people safe who dont have or know how to defend themselves from the predators in the world . what would you do james michael . kops have no duty to keep anyone safe moronlook up the hundreds of citesstating exactly that james michael . if you have respect for xops these days you either have your head up your ass or are stupid badcopwatch . this cop should be taught a lesson bruismenot . why for doing his job and just what lesson would you have him taught do you know him his training or his history if so please enlighten us elropo . his job my ass i am in complete agreement with gininitaly in my town we have the same situations with no brutality from the police they are pretty much respected here some rare exceptions it all depends on the mayor chief council hiring policies and just whether they keep assholes on the job gininitaly . thx and glad to see that you are blessed with a rational community good to know there are a few left out there  bruismenot . ok so you can tell this cop is an ass hole from this short clip you can tell that this upset girl is an angel bravo for you then bravo for you . fine now ive wasted enough time on here time to go to work peace james michael . she asked why her brother was being kidnapped the cop is required to inform her whyor it is unlawfulwe the people she is onehim sworn servantmoron haauwnk . you need to be strung up for fellating pigs its against your religion james michael . the nzis were doing their jobs committing treason and murder also moron ibcamn . cops are such cowards and pussysstep on my feet and im gonna arrest cowardscops only feel like real men when they are beating up womenall cops are just plain criminals gina . you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help . our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences . the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress . and be anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering . mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn . so is what your saying is bow down to these retarded criminals and follow orders without question and raise our children to be just like you and never question authority and be a slavesucks to be you stopkingobama . heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting real abuse instead of cases like these where morons get what they deserve for being stupid james michael . you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama . you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better . all you fucking limpwristed cream puff milquetoast libtard cophating social justice warriors with no respect for law and order should just be rounded up and shot or at least sent to iran it would make this country a hell of a lot better off james michael . resisting and obstructing are non sequiturs for we have nothing because there can be no resisting or obstructing without a real charge to resist or obstructanother aggravated assault and battery kidnapping false imprisonment by a another traitor felon with a badge ten thousand videos of the same exact thing on youtube alonedallas was deserved no cop can be trusted social trending breaking podesta told mills dump all those

investigation into s email server last week . because of gate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing  claimed . they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that  went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill  went there more than  times   went there at least six times he said . the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by  by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments  explained . i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of  almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the  justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters  said . theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the  justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that   is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe       to clarify these revelations . nypd was the first one to look at that laptop    and  his wife  the closest adviser of   for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for  sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from  s own homebrew server which contained classified information  faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found . so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt  contended . there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated . so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue  said . he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges . the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing .  agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the s .  agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials . listen to interview here . the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well  said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed . the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect   to prevent any real justice from being done he warned . as for the mayor of new york city  said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this . the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar  had well and truly begun to fade  is not alone in making this spectacular shift  and professional sjw  are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth. seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw

of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them. this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them. its not just famous people . many return of kings readers will remember  from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion

the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism. when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away. feminism as projection . it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings

either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to. rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the

not i write this to share the main key to my success patriarchal traditional religion . i am writing from my own religious convictions which i believe are true you are free to disagree but you may still find value here i have read the writings of other religions and consider them true myths useful for their wisdom even though i may disagree with their theology neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions or no religion modern religion ill find another church thanks . modern religion is a feminized wasteland god exists to impose obligations on men and excuses womens evil acts faith is blind irrational and collectivist . men hate modern religion which is why most churches in the west are demographically imbalanced toward women men are bored to death with touchyfeely sermons endless committee meetings female gossip and the losers sitting in the pews around them this is not how it should be patriarchal religion thats more like it . patriarchal religion is interesting to men it teaches that god is a man creator of rationality slayer of evil men protector of the innocent praise be to the lord my rock who trains my hands for war my fingers for battle psalm  . in maleled churches women are taught to be respectful to their fathers husbands and legitimate authority they understand that their role is to raise and care for children and support their husbands mission wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the lord ephesians  . in patriarchal religion female sins like rebellion envy dishonesty hypergamy dressing and acting like a whore and hamstering or rationalizing sin are condemned when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it genesis  i also want the women to dress modestly with decency and propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god  timothy  and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner  timothy  this is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and says ive done nothing wrong proverbs  finding a virtuous woman this is the unicorn i married . all women are tempted towards sins like envy but not all women act on their impulses in spite of what many observe in the west i have met many virtuous women few sexual partners before marriage respectful submissive to their husbands physically fit feminine good mothers most are in the older generations especially before the boomers most are involved in traditional religion there are fewer younger women who are virtuous and every single one that i have met is involved in traditional religion they tend to be more rural from small churches . traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women it provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman and it provides reliable references for a persons character a woman who spent her younger years out in the world and came back at  be a bornagainvirgin is a red flag but a woman in her early s who teaches sunday school and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material the older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore patriarchal religion helps control womens sinful tendencies with proper training woman can be virtuous . traditional religion acts as a curb but not a cure for womens immoral rebellious destructive behavior my wife goes to a womens bible study group where she often receives instruction from older religious women this includes things like telling her to be submissive to me lose weight and be healthy not waste money have cheerful sex on a regular basis and to learn how to get some control over her emotions teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children to be selfcontrolled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands titus  . one of my wifes friends once corrected her attitude toward sex saying you need to view your body as a sheath for your husbands sword she now routinely thanks me after we have sex i am not a natural alpha but i have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if i have a minor slip up band of brothers weve got your back bro deus vult . with this great power comes great responsibility as a patriarch i am commanded to lead my family instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly with genuine love for their wellbeing i must be on top of my game be physically fit and think rationally when my wife is irrational i attend a mens bible study where we talk about leading as men every man in my group owns a gun and we often go shooting together . we encourage support teach and correct each other i have had sharp intense discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions things are handled like men discussed in the open with realtalk not rhetorical bullshit and masculine love and concern for each other this has aided me in thinking deeply about my life and correcting bad decisions i have made . awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce he was working  hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer and had no energy to lead his family we told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit talk about your feelings more and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him the women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive in spite of her rebellious emotions . he cut back hours at work which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again this along with training his wife received helped her become more respectful now his wife is less of a bitch and they have sex several times a week i doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion children ive succeeded as a father . we see that our culture is toxic feminized and immoral men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins and church is a great place to do this my kids go to sunday school classes where they are taught to be respectful to me my wife and legitimate adult authorities we have several families with welldisciplined children that we can trust wont corrupt our kids my wife often takes the kids for playdates so she can socialize with wholesome women which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day conclusion patriarchal traditional religion will not change female nature but it can help restrain it this is how past generations maintained civilization i can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason i can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and childraising"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "as feminism erodes down to its tattooed lesbian core we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about third wave feminism not so much and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all. when one looks at modern feminism you see women who have flipped the script to use their term and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them a modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs but maybe not all her wants and has her own small place with her cats and netflix when she wants the company of men she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men. on the surface a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a red pill man yet upon closer examination she is actually an imperfect copy a man works harder more dangerous jobs and makes more money because of it thus he has money for anything he wants and more a proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy fit lifestyle and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women. however the most crucial difference lies in the outcome women who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable and i fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about  years from now men whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women also can live for other things than companionship and family and can be quite happy on their own even if they did want a family at one time or still do. so the question is if women despite their feminist pandering to the contrary actually do want a man to live with and grow old with why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way the answer like most things lies in the red pill philosophy women including feminists only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test. a woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water sjw society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store in the bookstore or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit at night youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club because they are there with the friends and not looking for that at work youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment. if you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls then you get the point and the answer is that youre not feminists and women in general know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place. . combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo if a man is successful good looking and alpha enough he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time and instead be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him. ultimately women do still need and want men they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postwall nascarstyle wrecks of women. when is enough enough when you look at feminism logically which is hard you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history and feminism is an effort to balance the scales they will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history and since women have been so disadvantaged men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts. i bet shes been in  rok articles by now. the question then follows if men owe women how much are we talking can it ever be paid off or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it i have three theories. it could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute the problem with absolutes is they lack scope the worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war whereas women although they get raped by the conquerors at least get to live i doubt most women have been treated that badly though on the balance so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality. the other two theories center on the idea that eventually men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism and the only difference lies in what happens then my second idea is not a noble one but it is probably the most accurate feminists you see are not for equality they are for female supremacy and once equality is reached women will get to be on top for millennia some would say we are already at that point and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had when you already have it all shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal that is if you actually have moral integrity. thats the third idea the concept of once all debts are paid true equality would rule i doubt this one would ever happen as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top plus being feelers not thinkers the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves. conclusion combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is while that is nothing new for those of us here at return of kings  and nothing new for those our message reaches the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here. the reason that feminism makes no sense and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point there is no way to win there is no equality there is only female superiority males that go along with it and men that do not. read more feminism has lost the minds of young women"}

for the presidency  is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like  and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating  with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy . this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by  they may not however know that  murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like  they pretend to be something they are not . millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being . the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf  despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature . we all know  is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul  but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of  and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility . the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph  million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths . these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society . courtesy of freedom outpost .  is a freelance writer and researcher david served

{"label": "bs", "text": " first female us attorney general dies at   . npr .  the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease s goddaughter    confirmed her passing to npr .  spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends  told the associated press she was  .  served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments . she was not president s first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial  finally turned to  . she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to  or washington but  wanted a woman and  was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years .  who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep  for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says  she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington .  arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi  authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader  who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound . in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years  would successfully quell critics on the right and left . what haunted me  explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when  came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up . years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense  admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way . waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes  who served in two top justice department jobs under  .  believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led  to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee eliÃ¡n gonzÃ¡lez from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba . eliÃ¡n had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress . but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on s orders raided the home removed eliÃ¡n and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba .  takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president  watches . barry thummaap . over the course of time  would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president  himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the gore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president . the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee . at  feet  inches however  stood tall in the political crosswinds  observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but  who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says  eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her . the controversies that the justice department faced during s reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case . after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but  the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety . it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison . in   was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak . that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her .  led with her values says former deputy attorney general  the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way . florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general  speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary .  won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law . us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain  stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values . former solicitor general  believes that  was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough . there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of s reign but she said she always took the long view of her job . if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  . president  made little secret of his frequent displeasure with  and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign  was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  . it was actually quite wonderful said  she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her . the tension between  and his attorney general was apparent even as s time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes   went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of  he was tepid to say the least . good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person . at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied  with a laugh ill take what i can get . indeed by the end of her tenure  had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that  had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party . on the last episode of the s dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near then suddenly the real  comes crashing through the wall of the set wearing the same blue dress and pearls as ferrell to deliver one of ferrells signature lines its  time . oh janet he says to the real  as he mourns the end of the skits run what do you do when you get

{"label": "hate", "text": "were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels. combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books . . yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training. as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre. weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets. eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as  and  upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons. one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed. in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner. . martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master. with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique. the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up. . mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do. while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding. . conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them. read more  effective fighting techniques that every man should know"}

plutocrat is a spicy capitalistic hungarian blogger follow his unyielding assaults against cultural marxism on his blog paprikaplutocratcom november   politics . on the  nd of october hungary has seen a stunning manifestation of national unity as  of votes cast on a referendum regarding the euimposed migrant settlement quotas were declared a strong and undebatable no now the hungarian national parliament works at incorporating the referendum results as an amendment to the countrys constitution while some leftwing news outletslike the guardiancelebrated the supposed inadequacy of the referendum it is beyond dispute that the message of the voting is strong and firm . here are five lessons we can learn from this monumental stand against globalism  democracies need strong leaders . wimpy western politicians would have their voters believe that personality does not matter strong witty and masculine politicians are often depicted as exponents of a fascistic personality cult nowadays it seems not much distinction is made between being a macho and being a nazi . in reality all great western democratic leaders were strong menand sometimes women winston churchill charles de gaulle david bengurion  and  were not known for being timid politically correct politicians who would retract and apologize for every past comment that theyve made do you think that todays eu politicians and western leaders could have beaten  or won the cold war . hungarys viktor orbÃ¡n might have some faults but he is certainly not a shy and weak politician who lacks magnetism even his opponents will grant him that he has a rare political talent and an almost visionary skill for seeing future happenings think of how one year ago hungary was the first european country to build a wall to keep the migrant wave out today most countriesfrom austria to great britainfollow his lead . just listen to his  th march  speech made on hungarys national holiday commemorating the countrys  freedom fight against the habsburgs look at how he is standing in the rain without some guy holding an umbrella over his head this man has speaking skills grand views and balls . the idea that western democracies can function with leaders who have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a lowgrade bank clerkto quote  who has so sharply put it to herman van rompuyis a lie and has no foundation in reality democracy is about the masses the masses need inspiration and leaders democratic leaders therefore have to be strong and need game themselves . i am personally a friend of monarchies and i have libertarian arguments for it but as long as the western world believes in democracy we cannot have cucks and wimps protecting it  liberty is protected by the rightwing . anyone who believes in game enjoys the fruits if western liberal capitalism like it or not yes the modern world has its faults but freedom of speech freedom of sex life freedom of entrepreneurship and freedom of travel are all essential parts of our lifestyle of course these are tenets that the left hates today in fact if you want to live free and live a masculine lifestyle the liberalism of today is certainly not your friend . therefore im going to write about liberty and not liberalism one can debate the difference between these terms in short what i mean is that the left today doesnt want you to be free but wants a politically correct nanny state to control and plan every move you make and punish you if you do not oblige . the right however still stands for the basic concept of personal liberty that we have grown to love and respect hungary has been criticized a lot by leftwing groups for having curbed some freedoms i will agree that some of these state actions were unnecessary and hardly defensible but hungaryand easterneuropetoday still has more freedom than some corners of the ohsoliberalandtolerant western world . in hungary universities rarely propagate the debased agenda of social justice wars cultural marxism is regularly attacked and barely tolerated feminism is rare and marginal and the country is overwhelmingly conservative and right wing the governing party with twothirds of parliamentary seats is centreright the largest opposition party is openly farright in the capital city of budapest one of the best and cheapest cities for nightlife and gaming in europe you will certainly not be prosecuted for stopping hot girls and asking for their numberunlike some western cities  minorities are misled . the hungarian pressmuch outside of the view of the grand world due to our rarely known and complicated languagehas been in throes for the past few months about the migrant crisis like most eastern european countries hungary barely has any immigration or muslims in fact if theres a black person on the street people will often turn their heads . debates that have been present in the western mediaabout muslim integration terror and islam palestine and israel have only recently surfaced in the hungarian press minorities of course have been misled by the leftwing press into believing that the migrants were refugees poor victims whom he have a responsibility to assist the jewish press meaning official jewish congregation organs not conspiracy theories and lgbt groups voiced their concern for tolerance and nonviolent communication . it is probably not a grand revelation to most readers of this site that muslim immigration brings little good to minorities as milo yiannopoulos said in a lecture of his the muslims are not on top of the oppression ladder but they want to kill all the others on the oppression ladder minorities have been misled into following the agenda of the political left the sight of hungarys gay public personalities demonstrating for letting in muslims in front the parliament is a clear proof of this  feminists love islam . feminism in hungary is a rare bird but it does exist one such radical marxistfeminist made the news when she openly argued that there could be no terrorists among muslim refugees this of course was before the paris and brussels attacks many of the perpetrators of which arrived as refugees through hungary a few days ago i stumbled across the facebook page of another fine specimen this hardly attractive girl celebrated the empowerment of the hijab which according to her was a beautiful expression of females voluntary decision to defy the dating market . describing such violent and shameful oppression of people as voluntary selfempowerment is crazy feminists live in denial of facts and the recent alliance between crazy radical islam and marxist feminism only proves that neither has any love for western culture  eastern europe is still ok . the western media gleefully celebrated the fact that with a voter turnout of a little more than  the  limit of required turnout was not reached according to hungarian laws however a referendum with  or more electorate turnout is valid even if not politically binding the hungarian government will soon amend the constitution to declare that brussels cannot force the country to take in immigrants without the consent of the people . such a policy is clear and sound the message is that eastern europewith all its faults economic lagging and sometimes real intoleranceis still a better place to live for masculine men that many a place in the western world here masculine lifestyle is appreciated donald trump has grand supporteven viktor orbÃ¡n voiced his good wishes for the republican presidentelectand feminism has failed to win any serious ground . eastern europe is still not lost and hungary is certainly among the best options for men of game today"}
{"label": "bs", "text": " shares.    . an important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the  administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington. the  administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system. the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  . the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students. in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education. the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them. a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades. opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators. a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization. doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against

sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t  fear god p   . armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milkandwater invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of bloodandiron t  fear god p  . american eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov   serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian  . even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia . mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them  the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe  . weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan . it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers  . i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war  . wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand

islam.  publisher new york nova science publishers.  isbn .  at a time of politics of fear  counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun  uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by  and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum. more stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars  presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value.  although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averrÃ¶es the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west. chapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun. in chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time. similar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter. in chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic. often when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars. chapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments. chapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence. chapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive. chapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation. anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression. this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace"}

{"label": "junksci", "text": "keywords cranberries  cranberry  cranberry juice  kidney disease  urinary tract infections  uti  utis . cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection uti or treat the symptoms but a new study finds theres no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos . a lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now cranberry juice  an unrealistic recommendation for utis . a urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder according to the urinary care foundation  utis cause more than  million visits to health care providers each year about  in  women and  in  men will have symptoms of at least one uti during their lifetime . for years now cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating utis however theres no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect . additionally based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist  from the yale school of medicine even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules you still dont see a noticeable positive effect . in response to this recent study lindsay e  an expert on utis from the university of manitoba advises the following . the continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent uti in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings .  adds clinicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven or even possible benefit any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning it is time to move on from cranberries myth versus facts . theres a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating utis has persisted for so long . first the active ingredient in cranberries  atype proanthocyanidins pacs  has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder so a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing utis something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure . but according to  md phd vice dean of the texas am health science center college of medicine houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for houston methodist hospital theres one problem  . cranberry juice especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store will not treat a uti or bladder infection it can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively but the active ingredient in cranberry is longgone by the time it reaches your bladder . dr boone adds it takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion this amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink theres a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents day but definitely not in modern times . for example ocean sprays cranberry juice cocktail is only  percent juice something so watered down could not be so ineffective . the second reason the myth continues is that its a tempting myth to believe if you experience recurring utis and want to prevent them  or you want to feel empowered while youre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect  drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like youre helping resolve your problem . unfortunately though youre paying a lot of money for something thats only really doing the same job as a glass of water and cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway golden rules for kidney health . you can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life . heres a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease  including urinary tract infections drink plenty of liquids especially water  drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that youll urinate more frequently  allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin stay active and keep fit  keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease eat healthy and keep your weight in check  this can help prevent diabetes heart disease and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease reduce your salt intake  the recommended sodium intake is  grams of salt per day  around a teaspoon try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food and dont add salt to food its easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients dont take overthecounter pills on a regular basis  common nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  like ibuprofen  are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly this type of medication probably doesnt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only however if you are dealing with chronic pain  like back pain or arthritis  work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk wipe from front to back  doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra change your birth control method  diaphragms or unlubricated or spermicidetreated condoms can all contribute to bacterial growth avoid potentially irritating feminine products  using deodorant sprays or other feminine products such as douches and powders in the genital area can irritate the urethra empty your bladder soon after intercourse  also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria regularly control of your blood sugar level  about half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions . this recent randomized clinical trial study titled effect of cranberry capsules on bacteriuria plus pyuria among older women in nursing homes is published in the journal

{"label": "hate", "text": "the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists  . the objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform . they wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings . the splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about . in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and  administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin s and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel . its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings . the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts . the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the  administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack  has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks . germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears . the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain . the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion . frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions . in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that  is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king . even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities . of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them . it even says that i have referred to barack  as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how  was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of  id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion . the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light . the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre . but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   .  is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center . whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head  on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct . overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in  at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men . as usual  this traces back to the prophet  after telling his followers that  had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that  had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him  alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife  quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet . but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of  andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits . thats because  made a pact with them according to koran   has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of  and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph  elaborated lining up for battle in the path of  jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to  he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour . as for those muslims who reject jihad  said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  . there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca  had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith . many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed  for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of s foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes . the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god  is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but  and  is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise . such was the genius of  in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity  took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting  . this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith . christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about  in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense . centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine  said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms . there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for  nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels . in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior"}

giant  in the biblical encounter  prevailed by keeping his foe  at a distance with a formidable weapon his sling. today a modernday version of  and  is playing out. although granted political asylum by ecuador a target of us empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in ecuadors london embassy under constant surveillance by british police the fully weaponized us empire which boasts of its fullspectrum dominance has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed as in having no conventional weaponry man who heads a publishing organization. this uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the militaryeconomic albeit faltering on both fronts behemoth to the worlds public the protransparency publisher wikileaks its founder and de facto political prisoner  and antisecrecy collaborators infuriated the united states establishment with a slew of documents emails and graphic exposes like the  collateral murder  video that demonstrated a us military engaged in war crimes. nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps but it is a oneway street as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question. more swedish government implicated in charges against  un body to rule on arbitrary detention of wikileaks founder websavvy wikileaks objects to this double standard and it welcomes vets and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to. evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers. leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers. in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on  and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring  down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us. in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense  spoke to the facts of the situation . here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric.  the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states. disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire. while in britain  was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview  in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which  was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens. despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and  has continued to give interviews  did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government. clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for s deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to  extremely telling about the caliber of man that  is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning. but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can. the result. the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz. clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a  direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions. the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray. the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally  felt compelled to state . the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source. neither is wikileaks complicit with russia. we have published about  documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up. graciously toward clinton  said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to  drone  him imagine what the response would have been if  had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton. presently  downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency. trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves. however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through  that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies. a revolution. no matter what transpires on november  the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental us democracy has  again  been revealed to be glaringly corrupt most importantly the worlds preeminent militaryindustrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person properly framed it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire"}

to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset . here are seven reasons why     was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash  wrong  won  of white vote  won  minority voters didnt turn out  david french davidafrench november   . in fact  was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than   did in  as the daily wire has explained  . unsurprisingly    in the latino and black votes by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent and  percent respectively surprisingly this was better than  fared among the aforementioned demographics in  as he lost both groups by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent to  percent respectively .  has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and  carried white millennials by  points . the enthusiasm was just not there for  .   was able to pull in former  voters according to the washington post   was able to win over onethird of the  counties that went for    was only able to win six of the  counties that didnt go for   was better at obtaining crossover voters than  was . so who are these former  voters who voted for  in  and what caused them to switch .  these former  voters felt that  cared about them and the democrat party did not john  explains in the federalist that  and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by s pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the  administrations regulations towards coal . while the democrats wrote off the rust belt  actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took .  was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes    used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president  did in  or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as  did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town .  the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped  per redstate  author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that  was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as  for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost . theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help  as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of s vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on s private email server but  is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss .  hillary was a terrible candidate if  had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the  foundation   is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically  is an  democrat without s charm according to jonah goldberg  . she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to  and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president  .  the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the biased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at  supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up  s vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains . journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological . that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong . as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup  which starts the cycle anew . the same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of  because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives . jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect  . which all culminates into the main reason why  was elected .  americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains  .  won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack  and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country .  won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates .  won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so . in other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites tags"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "why    american renaissance august  . it is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the united states will be black why will a nation we are so often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference . ever since  dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack    the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr  will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr  why will so many whites vote for mr  . first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr  . second as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as  or  but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black . for many whites voting for mr  will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for  is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials . third young whites will line up for mr  they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr  will make a special point of voting for mr  every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr  will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did . fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr  because they want to think they helped make history . the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr  is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr  as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr  makes and highlighting mr s . fifth many whites will vote for mr or at least not vote for mr because the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr  is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr  therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like . mr  will also crush mr  in facetoface debates mr  cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr  who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators . but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could . the final reason why whites will vote for mr  is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs  baptized their children and whom mr  calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle s thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr  has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this . many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr  is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the  nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr  and likes him but most have never heard of  whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr  will be perfectly safe . in any case mr   far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr  but are voting for him because he is white . racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr s policies are worse than mr s should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine . some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate . aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president  be much different from a president  she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it . president  will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr s first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all . even mr s starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr  may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr  inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get . on the bright side with mr  we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago

group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament

they are denied opportunities to work both  and  have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors . with university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock

amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists . schanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone . students for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them . in light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not

{"label": "junksci", "text": "by rmuse on thu oct th  at  am to avoid climateending global temperature rise it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy sources share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by  . over the past few months there has been a dearth of good news and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change even dismissing the horrible flooding wildfires droughts sea level rise melting ice caps hurricanes and worldwide food shortages there have only been dire reports on the level of co permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures . this week while most americans were living breathing and bleeding over  and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign the international energy agency offered up some good news for the climate the earths population and even for america . the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency iea that stated according to new data for the first time renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world . it may not seem like such fantastic news but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending degree c rise in global temperatures it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy generating sources this is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of americas c emissions carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming . the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in and coming from developing and industrialized nations alike for a developing nation it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants . the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass biogas eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources according to the environmental protection agency epa both terms renewable and green energy include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable . in addition to prorenewable policies such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the americachina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar and the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional  percent over the next five years onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another  percent during that same fiveyear period . although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet there was some extra good news in the report about americas transition to renewable energy according to the ieas mediumterm renewable market report the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity still america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of americas electricity . in time and if the koch brothers allow it america may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy . although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles?in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices financial mismanagement and new cleanair regulations but the amount of co driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs . the iea couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting however since the iea only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener significantly cheaper and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people . it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry particularly the dirty coal industry will absorb this good news in the past eight years republicans  the kochs their lobbyists at the heritage foundation americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals it is likely that the ieas report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy particularly solar republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the ieas report never mentions . image j pat carter"}

ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids . . the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting . . assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications . . vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others . . the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be . . by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient . . pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program  . . base one

{"label": "hate", "text": "how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe . daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   books . written in  the camp of the saints is a novel by  that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom . the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion . after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control  . youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life .  understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated  was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis  . and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics  tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate . the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west . i can tell  continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair . in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege . now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding . what drives the maniacal leftist  believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself . whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him . the book even predicted a cucked catholic church  knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly . i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day . the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime  yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault  . she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal  . yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer .  even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls . ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race . the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations . in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all  . when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead . the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling  made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book . the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov   roosh valizadeh"}
{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "home this month popular  things indian guys have to understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture . as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world . what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari . its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone . your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal . white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste . being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values they are women they get pussy tingles to the same game as white black asian orange maroon and kiwi women they have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors in a western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different  do not be afraid of the man . theres a man a dominant man somewhere in your family he dictates he dominates and he makes the decisions you have a fear of causing him displeasure you do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to . no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions . this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to indian culture but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game"}
{"label": "hate", "text": "the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos where are the condemnations of the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel november   . originally written for the investigative project on terrorism . israeli human rights group  recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements . in  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world . the uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion . given the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against  arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war . israeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities . last february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza . thus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities . ngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel . these leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros . in catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies . some foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities . the knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics . israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount . the obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister . the same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence . these organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world . if israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity . last week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message

that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family . one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape  its a cultural thing . when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing . as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants . thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling . and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation . immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled . in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling . somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing . in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack . when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants . even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two . compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack .  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   .  two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   . needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all . the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order s book in  we trust e pluribus awesome . by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place . the second case only was rape  of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex . those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican . that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team . similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one . when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of s foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men . conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and

time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam .  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment . perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good . manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the

s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids . . the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting . . assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications . . vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others . . the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be . . by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient . . pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the

money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running  inc . and band was also organizing personal income directly for  under the heading forprofit activity of president  ie  inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither  nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president  to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements . band mentions four such arrangements without naming them  was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid  more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the s including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the s tax returns  earned  in speaking fees . of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire world octopus . we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation . bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the  foundation how much they had paid  and in some cases how he or  had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments . band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for  he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place . band also described how  helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing  to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay  for speeches band wrote . band was actually making the case that the entire network of the  foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the s not to mention the interests of people around them . banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the  foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part . band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year . teneo meanwhile named  its honorary chairman  had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment .  was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason . and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining . but band outlined that  his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary  and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with s state department ethics agreement . s multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary  recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked  for his work on the issue . dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to  over a round of golf with  in august  . thats not

{"label": "hate", "text": "a gateway between western and eastern europe lies on the charles river in the czech republicprague its been a western tourist hotspot for many years now many people consider it a city overrun by the westerners ruined and no longer worth it. ive spent the last month of my travels here in prague and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east ukraine . with that being said here are  observations ive made about prague.  yes its overrun but . that doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun yes if you choose to stay in prague zone  youre going to have a drastically different experience there will be hoards of people with selfie sticks and fat western girls wobbling all over old town blocking the already narrow streets. if you head out to prague    etc youll have a much different experience youll get to meet some locals try beer other than staropramen and avoid the throngs of tourists. of course its important to note that prague is a beautiful city its natural to want to see some of the sights if you choose to go this route theres simply no way around it.  the reaction from locals changes over time . simply put locals are used to westerners and most of them roll their eyes at them however once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots theyre far more friendly. just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete  on me in the few weeks ive been here it went from a general coldness that they show all english speakers to genuine warmth.  the beauty of the city is unreal . this is my third time in prague and im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is from the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings its just a very pleasant place to be there are a lot of beautiful cities in europe but prague is definitely near the top of all of them. you cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it.  cheap by western standards expensive by ee simply put if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed and theres not many ways around it prague landlords know the power of western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it. its far far cheaper to sign a lease for a   or  month period. a meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between  usd this is incredibly cheap compared to places like italy spain or london at the same time its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as kiev budapest or some cities in poland. if you want actual numbers id say its about  more expensive than kiev probably about  more expensive than budapest the last time i was there was april  so keep that in mind and just marginally more expensive than poland. of course as i keep harping on this its going to get cheaper the further you go from the old town area.  the girls . i know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this so lets break it down the girls are hot theyre not as hot as ukrainian and russian girls but theyre a step above polish women . at this point its easy to see that any and all local czech girls living in prague are basically immune to foreigners you arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the old town in fact shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area. however being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there in colombia girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner in ukraine theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign in prague theyll do neither especially the high quality ones . however the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently. plus its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around just keep your liquor in check and avoid putting a gopro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game.  conclusionis it livable . when you come from a place like ukraine prague feels much more like home the english is better and it has a more western feel you can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the former soviet union countries ukraine belarus etc. the question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over theres no denying that prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was  years ago. however prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done the internet is fast the city is interesting and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do. you could do a lot worse. read more  habits all successful seducers share"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "a look at the universitys new mission october    .  a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice . the university however can only have one telos . the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades  claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met . the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  . we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country . we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students . we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities . a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  . antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable . the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men . black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy . presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases . these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks . nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression . it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles . the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty . concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it .  misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out . perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors . to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors . leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals . for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men . but theres more to it than this . the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted . yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american . the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor . now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice"}

by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race . and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world . and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president  she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that . youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than  boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree . mr s version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip . but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling  s working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well . then again in public pronouncements  called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door . a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed s talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs .  was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly . after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long . as for s superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against  for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from  to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  . egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of  s support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president   probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state  s appalling lapses in judgment . courtesy of  dont forget to

stood as his not guilty verdicts were read he nodded and mouthed to the jury thank you defendant r hugged and kissed his defense lawyer  . the coda to the stunning verdict undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors was when s lawyer  argued that his client dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt should be allowed to walk out of the court a free man . us district judge anna j

before the judge . suddenly a group of about six us marshals surrounded  at his defense table the judge directed them to move back but moments later the marshals grabbed on to him . what are you doing

team confirmed . s lawyer j  said afterwards on the courthouse steps that  had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun or taser on his back another member of s legal team rick koerber echoed philpot saying he heard  questioning in court why they were using a taser against him . philpot decried the marshals treatment of  in the courtroom what happened at the end is symbolic of the improper

because of medical ailments said he called his client right away . hes been fighting for more than  years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him schindler said its vindication . schindler said he believes the jurys verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the intent of the defendants was to conspire against the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management . the judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendants state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations schindler said . when prosecuting a drug conspiracy its easy to point to what the defendants underlying objective is but in this case schindler said there was no obvious underlying self interest he said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state and not just from portland . oregon us attorney billy williams sat in the back of the courtroom with oregons fbi special

rare display three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves five of them were among the more than  people who took the witness stand to testify . and one of the original  jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations  what the judge called an extraordinary circumstance an alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining  jurors thursday morning . there was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings . often supporters knelt in prayer in the

october   news . you commit to treat everyoneregardless of race religion national origin ethnicity disability sex gender identity sexual orientation or agewith respect and without judgment or bias .  airbnbs new sjw diktat . shortterm residential accommodation network airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new nondiscrimination policy  including a requirement to accept transgender people the policy takes effect on november  and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes which airbnb says are designed to make its community more inclusive those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with airbnb . the major problem with airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings rather than proven discrimination the overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it this rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on airbnb to generate an income it also makes it very easy for certain protected groups most notably transgender people to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination when in fact the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property . secondly the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes or their sole investment property whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences airbnbs open doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth  mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech sjw  of twitter . well be implementing a new policy called open doors starting october st if a guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing having a booking canceled or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that guest a similar place to stay if one is available on airbnb or if not we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere .   airbnb ceo and cofounder . in addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties another one of airbnbs new policies which is already in force treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or more strangely still alternative accommodation outside its network the second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned airbnb decide to go public it is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money . airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it too on the one hand it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible now having providers offering  listings in  cities around the world on the other hand however it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations airbnb are mere gatekeepers providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers these same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model allegations of discrimination have been scant at best we dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates so why not airbnb providers and their guests . various news articles reporting on the shift in airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged  let alone proven discrimination the best that sjw enablers can offer is a deeply flawed harvard study which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical africanamerican names like latoya and darnell were  percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name the harvard research leaves a lot to be desired . moreover names like cletus and marysue would arguably garner even less approvals both these white names and the aforementioned africanamerican names usually dovetail with some of americas least sophisticated and worldly types the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home it has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought so why not with airbnb has airbnb signed its own execution order  bookingcom is better than airbnb  cheaper prices always instant booking tons of apartment listings better interface and no sjw crap .  roosh rooshv october   . just as roosh swears by bookingcom there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding airbnb from now on like twitter the company is quickly falling under the spell of the sjw crowd it seems certain that minus a backtrack airbnb and its reputation will follow s company into the abyss unlike twitter though airbnb may never make the jump to publiclylisted company . we live in very sad times for freedom but theres one freedom we can all exercise nowstaying the hell away

demonizing obstructing and criticizing every and anything about the  of the united states republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic  whose approval rating and popularity are growing . it is hypocritical to say the least and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy if any republican believed   would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election . the  is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of    is also reminding republicans that   is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility  it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that   seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him  but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at republicans . two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the s approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the  that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed opposed and attempted to get rid of . ohio senator  had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the  to break the grip of heroin addiction   took the time to excoriate  for .  finally withdrawing his support from   but only  after looking at the polling now that its politically expedient but he has supported him up until last week so i guess it was ok when  was attacking minorities and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms making fun of disabled americans i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge why was that ok and now he says he will vote for the viceial nominee instead except that guy still supports   . the  was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the   one of the most corrupt s in modern times california republican representative daryl issa is sending out campaign mailers with the s face on them and boasting about his close work with    to protect victims of sexual assault  . daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the s wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issacreated scandals during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last the  assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the s image on it the  said .  issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on edup investigations that have led nowhere this is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me now that is the definition of chutzpah . as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones   is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces  . the  clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with he said  .  heres the thing for years republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me about hillary about harry they said i wasnt born here they said climate change is a hoax they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law this is what theyve been saying for years now so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like  . and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do we wont be able to appoint judges well gum up the works well create gridlock itll give us a political advantage so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff so  did not start this  didnt start it he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it take credit for it and promote it thats what he always does and so now when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away oh this is too much so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down suddenly thats a dealbreaker well what took you so long what the heck what took you so long all these years . the mother jones piece made out like   is seeking retribution or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years without knowing what goes on in the s head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety barack  does not strike one as being vindictive . the  is though an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from  it is prudent of the  to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why

mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain. . those are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now. . when the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years. . this is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged. by the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays. there are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors. also these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house . add to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society. httpstcornbrpfws quÃ©bec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students.  nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   . . the data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements. a metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here . the only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly. these findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males. pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice. its time we fight for equal tax. here are my social media accounts twitter  facebook

{"label": "hate", "text": " reply . according to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years among the many alleged secrets the vatican has there is a device called the chronovisor the device enables its user to observe future as well as past events many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had . some even believe it is a crucial tool which has allowed the vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years . ever since h g wells composed his novel the time machine many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel even theoretical physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction or so it seems at least interestingly on may   an italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline a machine that photographs the past has finally been invented  . the news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with  . the alleged device which according to many is nothing more than science fiction was built in the s by a team of scientists led by father pellegrino maria ernetti an italian physicist who eventually became a priest . it is believed that the team received important help from nobel laureate  and famous rocket scientist wernher von braun . the chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys cathode tubes some dials and levers reports by  suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations important events and follow in history noteworthy individuals according to  he had observed among other historical events s crucifixion and photographed it as well view image the image to the left is the one obtained using the chronovisor on the right is a similar image located in a church in perugia . it is even said that under the perfect conditions the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future   remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the chronovisor .  did however reveal that the chronovisor worked by processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes . according to numerous reports  used the chronovisor to witness important historical events with the most notable being the crucifixion of    revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and other major historical events such as the founding of rome in  bc also thanks to the chronovisor  was able to recompose the missing work thyestes  written by ennio quinto and represented in rome in  ac in its original version and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by god exodus  which were given to moses on mount sinai apart from witnessing the likes of napoleon roman philosopher cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes . french priest franÃ§ois charles antoine brune was one of the first to hear about the chronovisor according to father franÃ§ois he met  in the s when the two were traveling across the grand canal of venice as the two were experts in ancient languages they began to talk about the bible and its interpretation through the years supposedly these are the blueprints of the chronoviso r image . father brune that was very intrigued when the  revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the bible . when father franÃ§ois asked about the machine  described the chronovisor saying that it was device that functioned just like a tv but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to see and hear events that had occurred centuries before . ernetti told brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had created which were floating in space . it is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the vatican but not destroyed some believe the chronovisor is located somewhere in the vatican hidden in one of the many chambers hidden away from society  there are other versions that suggest that  and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen . interestingly before  died in april  he wrote a letter in which he insisted that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed .  claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of  on the cross showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of jesus located in a church in perugia . critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of thyestes included latin words that did not exist at the time it was made . in   also said that pope pius xii forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous it can restrain the freedom of man  in  the vatican issued a decree in which it warned that anyone using an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated according to many this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the chronovisor never existed so why issue a warning if it was just another hoax . what do you think about the story behind the chronovisor do you think it is another top secret object kept away from society by the vatican sf source rise earth"}

see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay . thanks for the comment my nigga guy . although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  . you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  . we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  . we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr . she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy . so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original  and  shows and thought they were great i never liked  and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed  was right while thinking that  and  are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of  who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr . im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr . further more fuck jessie  im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy . mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  . now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  . what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  . personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  . i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children . i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  . when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  . if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr . you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy . no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area . brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  . my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding . now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  . my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  . as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr . get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy . i am a little confused which is not hard to do . i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  . if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  . for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  . i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it . but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  . i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in . cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr . yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy . damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  . it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene . i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing . unfortunately that is the times we all live in and certainly it is unfair to you to be victimised because of it i hope you filed a complant against this ass hole to seek retrabutin  mr . i understand that ive did things in my life im not happy bout cant sleep at nite the nightmare i have i jus take it one day at a time and think god im still breathing truth be told i almost lost my life  times before i was  and the only thing slowed me down from the streets is my first son hes  now my middle son  and my baby boy is  and i have a lil girl that jus turned  so i thank god a lot cause i have something to live for havent been to a club in yrs it feels good to be out the streets and doing some good for a change only thing i have did to make my life complete is going back to church but ill go when im ready but i do read the bible so there for i dont forget where i come from i respect u and dont know u its actually good we had this chat everything u told me i took that inconsideration truly i thank u i dont know everything but i dont mind listen mr . i stop dealing drugs a few yrs ago actually until i find a job that pays  a hr when my ma first found out she had cancer i use to make sure i would not go home unless i had  a week in my pocket to help my ma with her medical bills and medicine she fought that cancer for yrs right before she died  yrs ago i promise her i wouldnt sale anymore and that was a promise i keep  at the end of the month i had to put in a lot of blood and tears for what i did and my ma was not proud of the blood money i was bringing into the home but when she seen what i was actually doing with my money i think she respect me to a certain degree and i accepted that sometimes she would accept nothing from me ive been locked up  times and started dealing weedcokegunspills at the age of  honestly my ma use to beat me when she found out but i never stopped i caught my first charge at  by the time i was  i had did everything i could possibly do i think i had a good run in life i never had my father after the fact he was a big time drug dealer and him and ma got a divorce and he got on his on product and lost everything he been sober for  yrs he doing good but i never hated him for what he did in life actually it made me stronger i had a step dad but only he was good for is taking me fishing far talking to bout men things he did cause he didnt know how to cause he had  girls but at the end of the day he raised me from the time i was  until he passed he was good man in his own ways and till this day i thank god for each parent i had in my life with no regrets i jus wish the world become a better place guy . hey  at least you are still alive and hopefully clean and sober with a family that loves you  that is a lot more than some of the people you knew when you were running the streets ill bet consider yourself mr to be blessed  . never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  . i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  . what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do . hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr . im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy . good to hear now what are you doing  mr . doing father dutys guy . so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts . just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy . i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr . as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy . of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural . my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way . there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years . you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  . mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr . i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton . call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do . in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy . i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton . on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online . we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online . however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy . she and everyone else who speaks in public  . trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton  . thanks for taking the time to further explain your point and now that you have i tend to agree with you although i still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady was harsh  . but considering she works in a public tax supported office its to be expected to bad she dint have the common sense to see it  hill billy"}

{"label": "hate", "text": "home this month popular the path men took to  the path men took to  . daryush roosh valizadeh  rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics . every man who supports donald  came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support  because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center . in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door . i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it . it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around . fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  . the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who  the narrative she believes . i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them . though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald  donald  ground zero . im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow  to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe . the ground zero for donald  within the manosphere was the donald  thread on the forum  in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have . after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald  the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time . the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election . two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for   and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a  presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald  doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency . obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat  . not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment . for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of  saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge  by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign . i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink s candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully  responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down . the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that s support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that  was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug . from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against  i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor . the most important lesson i learned from s victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination . george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald s own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably . think right now of how much effort the anti forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public . whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing . now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled . you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is  and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes . if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion . we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes . im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next nov   roosh valizadeh"}
{"label": "bs", "text": "posted by  . a  brother of the nowdisgraced     whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia . no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth . in   and a formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest . according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  a is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account . at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight . for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations .  previously served as president s chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president  and now chairs s campaign . a acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for s campaign . think about that for a moment . one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the  campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities . as the washington post reported months ago in july as lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund . the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger  to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then as fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution . notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict . additionally as status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former  foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders . hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising . i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon . to which general counsel to the  campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added . responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for  . as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds . where do we draw the line though . elias suggests a particularly intricate solution . if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically . put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen . as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground . mook eventually decides plainly . marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat  actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that . all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  . as specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine . saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying . that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt  campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well . as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee s campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign . although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts . the system isnt rigged  its performing exactly as intended  and always will as long as the vote validates its existence dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the

survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr  photo first liberty . the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church . but dr  is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers . the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by  against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations . hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons . s ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church .  the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later  was fired . at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency . police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today . now in response to s lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts . this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said  senior counsel for first liberty . no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said  in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so . officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment . s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support . on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code . wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen . the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  . in a prepared statement wednesday on s case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us . welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to  is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons . first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america . leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to s defense . penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr  is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs . can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share . wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed s sermons and then fired him . no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of s sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist . state officials also joked about informing  of his firing . the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up . pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it

london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  . the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses . human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines . dr  head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on . we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act . however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright s  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years . the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife . for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr  wwf . this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world . the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos . any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study . the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time . some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture . the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years . this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  . dr  said some groups of animals had fared worse than others . we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example . it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing . if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl . the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade . dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse . but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates . however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms . there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university . stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure . there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news . for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe . when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean . theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed . but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world . its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data . were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline . its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed"}

{"label": "conspiracy", "text": "american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female  brand american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female   andrÃ© is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   girls . the paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart born in this very city i had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights and paris being one of the most visited cities in the world  i could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues the middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around . yet go twenty meters below the haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different . south of the seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there exploring the place is officially forbidden which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar . officially prohibited actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles  the catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in paris it allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously . the underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it on the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities . well today other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope  a hawaiian  or  years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the daily mail  so im here to teach you about protecting the planet yknow i love bringing surfboards in places without waves by the way im the feminine  especially with the help of a crew ill never give credit to follow me on instagram and yt . here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly the daily mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of alisons adventures im not joking these adventures are literally hitler a trademark . since she was at least  teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way with the help of her dad a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion longhaired alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment . her rÃ©sumÃ© shows a massive ego associated to minor lies the world was my school and playgroundi guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under paris as we are to see below between namedroppings references to media awards and other big pictures of  and  we learn she was styled the female  by time magazine  and the oprah of adventure by the huffington post  really . actually teal said to the huffpo she aspired to be the oprah of adventure in  before branding herself as the female  to the time a year later  not  then she said on twitter and on her rÃ©sumÃ© how they had referred to her as such not a big lie but a lie indeed by the way she also branded herself a tarzan child in the huffpo interview would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons excerpt from the huffpo article  the same articles adds she is a selfdescribed tarzan child excerpt from the time article  named by time magazine or selfstyled and now on her rÃ©sumÃ© not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces . so selfstyled female  no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the daily mail by descending into the paris catacombs with the symbols of her adventures namely a pink bikini and a surfboard the english tabloid released the photos video and testimony of indianajonesinabikinisurfingthecatacombs the  th of october days after a bunch of french outlets copied the mail content often translating it verbatim  . what struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published first the mail claims teal went  meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the catacombs goes between  and  meters depending on where you are in the network cant indiana jane tell the difference between  and  meters . second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising this is at best extremely unlikely the water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds as for the oxygen issue i have witnessed some only two times at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place . either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations the mail just ate that up and published without question they did not ask any actual cataphile for sure had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what i just wrote above . i also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her she would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that the first photo displayed by the mail notice how she strategically displays some of her butt . i could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen as julius evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible evola revolt against the modern world  chap . in this respect the only thing that makes teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones ie remnants of real past men in a pink bikini doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful . this is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass  imagine going to hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng what do you expect would happen you would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that all this i think would be fair but when a selfimportant oprah jane of superadventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism . though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure i think especially appalling the outlook teal seems to carry on the place the catacombs are just another background for alison adventures whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character the entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of disneyland and hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around some weeks ago  was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt . usual newcomers to the catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place they come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure they cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that paris could grow . this is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that alisons ego adventures show continues . as you can see above a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from youtube putting it into private mode . teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the westernization of the world in the west there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic there are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into disneylands the catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be . fortunately there can be some immanent justice the wave of criticism under teals disrespectful show is well deserved more harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through middle east to prove muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about the event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for western strong and independent narcissists . in a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members . truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well your humble servant bathed there before teal pretended to surf the place but i would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted by  . in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down   s coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into s emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that  altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life . i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  . whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both . if  is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life . i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in s emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through . as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of  s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee . metadata found on the laptop used by former rep  and his estranged wife    aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs  used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs  at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the  email probe . of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation . at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  . government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not . either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said . but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by  and  and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi . many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the s entitled  guilty as sin  . the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source  friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week . some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist . according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice . he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom . so what happens next . in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge  before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the  campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump . however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against  are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day . in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see  forced out of the race before november th . once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible . if  was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be . in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past . this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure . the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead . it sure seems ironic that  is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale . courtesy of  dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter

{"label": "hate", "text": "an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october      administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute . during  term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase . many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity . instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president  . adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling  cash author and anticorruption crusader  is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here   report states  department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority . it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress . much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader  calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer  illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope . many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats . catalist a rosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states . catalist was founded by former bill  aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases . according to a capital research center report  . catalist boasts it was vital to president s  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the  campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet . of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like ros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels  report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist . in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else . conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states . changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests . conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it . this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary  becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new  administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by ros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez  moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts . activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken . few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination . leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending  shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the  administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market . president  turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  . when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent

his designated successor former first lady and secretary of state  as the fbi continues its investigations and  emails continue to emerge it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative . last year s narrator as the new york times called  released his massive believer  my forty years in politics  the author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life .  its  said the voice on the phone im thinking about what i want to do next and was wondering if we could talk this call took place in  which explains the perfect timing . on february   the presidents maternal grandfather  passed away at  so  as the narrator called him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own . in the  dreams from my father  might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king    might not the kenyan student  h  bears little resemblance to  who passed away in  but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter s unforgettable album . the narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction . dreams from my father has no photo section no index and key characters get only a first name these include  who gets  words back in  the president himself identified this person as  marshall    regards as the presidents mentor as he explained in the communist the untold story of  marshall   . in dreams from my real father  documentarian  made a case that  is the presidents biological father malik  son of the kenyan  h  sees a strong physical resemblance  that also holds true on the policy side professor  found remarkable similarities between the writings of  and the policies of president   . the kenyan   though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice ba university in moscow indeed  warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa . the kenyan  would have found strange the presidents  cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in s washington  . the kenyan  h  had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from  until his death in  in keeping with his country and most of africa the kenyan   is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes  marshall  on the other hand was certainly on board as  wrote in his  memoir livin the blues  . during the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the s i often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes in my mind i envisioned the result an indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise . that and  pornographic novel sex rebel black  might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character . in dreams from my father  the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth . in audacity  the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding . the predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer  but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended  ann dunham  and even the kenyan   are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways . in a  brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains  neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators .  did likewise in  passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president  has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit  hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than  emails disappear . the contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear . the potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which . back in july the party faithful were chanting four more years during the presidents speech at the democratic national convention"}

{"label": "bs", "text": "posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science t american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target . on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country . my swedish colleagues agreed with french author  writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide . but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what  shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression  waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society . south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as  put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face . the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of  at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall . in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying . if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens . the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism . this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  . needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well . in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation . miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo . although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  . i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that . miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  . mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried . the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     . in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them . but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor . unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg . in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues . we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge . he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her . are south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of africa"}
