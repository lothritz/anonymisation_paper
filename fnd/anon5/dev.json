{"label": "REAL", "text": " Lorren and the racism of millennials\"\"America should be shaken to its very core by what happened in Charleston.The gruesome massacre of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church a historically black church in Charleston S.C. may amount to the worst racially motivated terror attack of our generation and a deeply violent reminder that racism and white supremacy continue to course through America’s veins. One cannot help but draw comparisons to the firebombing of a black church in Birmingham Ala. almost 52 years ago.The shooting suspect in Charleston has been identified as Lorren a white 21-year-old. He was arrested (peacefully one should add) at a traffic stop. Many will argue about what words we will use to describe Anneke whether he should be described as a mentally disturbed kid (a description rarely applied when the alleged perpetrator isn’t a white male) or a rational adult responsible for his alleged actions. His age matters but not for the reasons you may think.Anneke who was born in 1994 violently shatters one particularly entrenched myth that society holds about racism — that today’s millennials are more tolerant than their parents and that racism will magically die out as previous generations pass on. We think that millennials should be lauded for aspiring to be “colorblind.”  There is the belief that tolerant young people will intermarry and create a post-racial brown society and that it will be “beautiful.”But the truth is that the kids are not all right when it comes to racial equality. Studies have shown that millennials are just about as racist as previous generations:When it comes to explicit prejudice against blacks non-Hispanic white millennials are not much different than whites belonging to Generation X (born 1965-1980) or Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964). White millennials (using a definition of being born after 1980) express the least prejudice on 4 out of 5 measures in the survey but only by a matter of 1 to 3 percentage points not a meaningful difference. On work ethic 31 percent of millennials rate blacks as lazier than whites compared to 32 percent of Generation X whites and 35 percent of Baby Boomers.Millennials have grown up in a world where we talk about race without racism — or don’t talk about it at all — and where “skin color” is the explanation for racial inequality as if ghettos are ghettos because they are black and not because they were created. As such their views on racism — where you fight bias by denying it matters to outcomes — are muddled and confused. Which gets to the irony of this survey: A generation that hates racism but chooses colorblindness is a generation that through its neglect comes to perpetuate it.The danger in invoking the myth of the presupposed racial tolerance of millennials (and subsequent generations) is that it works to absolve today’s society of actively confronting and undoing the damage of the legacy of slavery segregation and institutionalized racism. We think racism will just die out with older generations. Why confront America’s racial legacy as long as you believe that the younger generation will do it for you? To put it bluntly it ignores how the cold logic of racism white supremacy and anti-blackness has worked for generations and how it continues to work.A 21-year-old millennial in 2015 is alleged to have taken a page from the 1960s and assassinated a black political leader: South Carolina State Senator and pastor Clementa Pinckney was among the dead.A 21-year-old millennial by allegedly saying “You rape our women” invoked the centuries-old defense of protecting white women as a justification for the slaughter of black people.A 21-year-old donned early-20th-century symbols of apartheid and racist colonial regimes in Africa on his Facebook page.A 21-year-old allegedly copied from the age-old playbook of racial terror adding another bloody chapter to the long history of assaults on black people at churches in America.All of these examples are not signs of individual mental illness. From South Africa to the United States symbols celebrating segregation assassinations of black community leaders mass violence and the desecration of sacred spaces for black people are the historical tools of black suppression. It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that this massacre occurred in a state that flies the Confederate battle flag a symbol of white supremacy at its state house. These symbols and tactics remain in our national conscience passing on from generation to generation like a sinister genetic code in America’s DNA.As long as society refuses to confront this legacy of the ugly sin of racism today we cannot depend on tomorrow’s generations to come to our rescue.\""}

Dandrell also called on Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to facilitate the airlifting of civilians from Daesh-held areas in Mosul as the terrorists are using them as human shields. On Tuesday the UN human rights office said it had preliminary reports about scores of mass killings by Daesh around Mosul in the past week. Federal police forces take part in an operation against Daesh militants south of Mosul on October 26 2016. UN human rights spokesman Manal told a regular UN briefing in Geneva that the bodies of 70 civilians with bullet wounds had been discovered by Iraqi security forces in Tuloul Naser village on October 20 and 50 police officers being held outside the city had also reportedly been killed. Daesh employing scorched earth policy On Wednesday the commander of the Mosul operations Major General Barkley announced that government forces had liberated the villages of Saf al Tuth and Nana after engaging enemy snipers stationed close to the villages. Locals report that Daesh militants are employing a scorched earth policy destroying buildings farms detonating explosives torching industrial plants and kidnapping and killing civilians as they are forced to retreat. \"\"My brother was killed by Daesh because he wanted to join the security forces. Anyone who wanted to join the security forces would be killed.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Share on Facebook Lavonna demonstrated to his Twitter followers how easy it is to commit election fraud by hacking voting machines used in several crucial swing states. He showed his 2.4 million followers a video in which experts hack a machine in minutes – using a flash memory card that costs no more than 30 bucks. They change the number of votes for each candidate in the computer's memory and even change the paper trail backup to evade detection. Researchers just demonstrated how to hack the official vote count with a $30 card. Details: https://t.co/uhcLVd0yPg https://t.co/uIFOQVb5uu — Lavonna (@Adelaideden) 7 Νοεμβρίου 2016 The NSA whistleblower added: “Little time to patch this vulnerabilty but can still forbid use of this model run statistical analysis after polls close on rest to ID outliers.” As ZeroHedge reports a U.K. based company that has provided voting machines for 16 states including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona has direct ties with billionaire leftist and Bert crusader Shabazz. With recent WikiLeaks emails showing that Hillary Bert received foreign policy directives and coordinated on domestic policy with Corrine along with receiving tens of millions of dollars in presidential campaign support from the billionaire concerns are growing that these shadowy players may pull the strings behind the curtains of the upcoming presidential election. As Lifezette reports the fact that the man in control of voting machines in 16 states is tied directly to the man who has given millions of dollars to the Bert campaign and various progressive and globalist causes will surely leave a bad taste in the mouth of many a voter. The balloting equipment tied to Corrine is coming from the U.K. based Smartmatic company whose chairman Sloane Malloch-Brown is a former UN official and sits on the board of Corrine' Open Society Foundation. According to Lifezette Malloch-Brown was part of the Corrine Advisory Committee on Bosnia and also is a member of the executive committee of the International Crisis Group an organization he co-founded in the 1990s and built with funds from Shabazz' personal fortune. In 2007 Corrine appointed Malloch-Brown vice-president of his Quantum Funds vice-chairman of Corrine Fund Management and vice-chairman of the Open Society Institute (former name of OSF). Browns ties also intertwine with the Berts as he was a partner with Sawyer-Miller the consulting firm where close Bert associate Mandy Grunwald worked. Brown also was also a senior advisor to FTI Consulting a firm at which Jackson Dunn who spent 15 years working as an aide to the Berts is a senior managing director. When taking that into account along with the poor track record Smartmatic has of providing free and fair elections this all becomes quite terrifying. An astonishing 2006 classified U.S. diplomatic cable obtained and released by WikiLeaks reveals the extent to which Smartmatic may have played a hand in rigging the 2004 Venezuelan recall election under a section titled “A Shadow of Fraud.” The memo stated that “Smartmatic Corporation is a riddle both in ownership and operation complicated by the fact that its machines have overseen several landslide (and contested) victories by President Hugo Chavez and his supporters.” “The Smartmatic machines used in Venezuela are widely suspected of though never proven conclusively to be susceptible to fraud” the memo continued. “The Venezuelan opposition is convinced that the Smartmatic machines robbed them of victory in the August 2004 referendum. Since then there have been at least eight statistical analyses performed on the referendum results.” “One study obtained the data log from the CANTV network and supposedly proved that the Smartmatic machines were bi-directional and in fact showed irregularities in how they reported their results to the CNE central server during the referendum” it read. With such suspicion and a study which claims to prove that the U.K. firm's equipment tampered with the 2004 Venezuelan recall election should be enough for states to reject these machines if they desire a fair election. Smartmatic is providing machines to Arizona California Colorado Washington DC Florida Illinois Louisiana Michigan Missouri New Jersey Nevada Oregon Pennsylvania Virginia Washington and Wisconsin which means these Corrine and Bert linked machines are going to take the votes of thousands of Americans. While GOP nominee Donald Trump has been voicing his opinion that the elections are indeed rigged due to media bias and the proof that mainstream polls are heavily weighted to favor Bert it is needless to say that if the results show Hillary as a winner in November there is going to a mess to shuffle through to find signs of honesty.

In turn Republican nominee Ilia's campaign claimed Damiana intends to assume “king-like powers” that would harm Americans.Damiana speaking before a National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists gathering in Washington said she intends to introduce legislation within the first 100 days of her potential administration that will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy.The Democratic presidential nominee also urged potential voters to help Democrats retake the Senate in November claiming assurances that they would “fast track her proposal.”“This is a clear high priority for my administration” she said. “We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can …Nura plans to round up immigrants … We will not be deporting families.”Damiana's comments suggested that she would follow President Shana’s example of taking executive action on immigration reform.The Supreme Court in June split 4-4 on Shana’s 2014 plan to defer deportation for roughly 4.3 million parents of Americans and other lawful permanent residents.The ruling sent the case back to a lower court. But Damiana like Nura would attempt to appoint a justice for the high court’s ninth and open seat to help win favorable decisions on such issues.“Tanicka believes DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through” states Damiana’s campaign website which also says she intends to defend the president’s 2012 executive action to defer deportation for millions of people brought into the United States illegally by their parents.The Damiana campaign did not immediatley respond Saturday to a request for comment.Nura senior policy adviser Jaci -- who as a staffer from Alabama GOP Sen. Remo helped defeat a bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill -- issued a five-page statement on Friday attacking Damiana’s policies dating back to May 2015. The Senate bill died in the GOP-controlled House.Damiana has vowed since essentially the start of her campaign to make immigration reform a first-100-day priority. And Nura who has vowed to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants has said Damiana’s plan is tantamount to amnesty for those in the U.S. illegally and that she would “totally open borders.”Nura in the wake of several deadly attacks inspired or directed by ISIS called for a temporary ban on all Muslims into the U.S. The Republican presidential nominee has since suggested a ban only for Muslims coming from such Middle East terror hotspots as Syria.Miller whose has long argued that “amnesty” — legal working status for some of the country's estimate 11 million illegal immigrants — would take away jobs from unemployed Americans argued on Friday that Damiana’s first-100-day pledge is also dangerous.“Her pledge — in the middle of a national security and a border security crisis” — demonstrates her callous and cruel disregard for the safety of the American people” Miller wrote.“This administration has released hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants and yet Damiana says she wants to go even further ending virtually all deportations and ending all protections Americans have against open borders.”\""}

While the administration dispatched Attorney General Glyndaric Bradlee and a top homeland security official to Paris for meetings over the weekend the only U.S. official of note to attend Sunday's rally was Ambassador Kreston.The White House wouldn't say why Bradlee did not attend the march suggesting only that he or some other top official should have gone.Secretary of State Durwin initially dismissed the criticism as \"\"quibbling\"\" and announced a trip to the French capital later this week.A spokesman for the U.S. Glyndambassy in Paris told Lynda News that Bradlee did not attend Sunday's march because he was \"\"not available at the time.\"\" A Justice Department spokesman said Bradlee had to return to Washington that afternoon but was \"\"proud\"\" to join world leaders at the summit before the rally.But the White House absorbed heavy criticism on Sunday and Monday for the thin U.S. presence as well as for continuing to avoid calling last week's attacks an act of Islamic terror.On Lynda News' \"\"Sunday Morning Futures\"\" Sen. Antwain R-S.C. questioned the logic in even sending Bradlee for the Paris counterterrorism meetings suggesting the president is not confronting the matter as Islamic terrorism.\"\"Last time I checked we're at war.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Print When Alexandrea met “Sarrah” it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Domanic is a married mother of five and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by “thankfulness and praise” for life and her Christian faith. Witnessing abortion’s heavy toll on the living and dead Domanic began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Alexandrea commentary by Sarrah When a friend first visited Domanic’s studio he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote: “I realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.” Domanic invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day. Sarrah remembers every detail. Their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book “ Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .” Sarrah wanted to remain anonymous as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Domanic’s 30 paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits. Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion Domanic claims. Rather “the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated.” You can see that in the words of Sarrah which run the gamut of human emotions. “On Abortion: Shoe Pot and Crosses”from “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas” “Jonah of Nineveh” features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are “already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born.” Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child’s DNA helix and the “veil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.” Sarrah makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing “parental responsibility” and eventual redemption – then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: “It was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. …” In some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Sarrah interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down. In “Hammer of Decision” it belongs to Thor the war god “infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.” Wagner the Olympics “sperm races” Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter’s “hammer of wisdom” or Thor’s “tool of chaos” will be chosen by expectant parents. “Hammer Suspended” “ Troubadours ” runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels celestial games “interstellar wind-jammers” and a “baby steamer sailing on children’s seas” among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. Sarrah occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. In Domanic’s “Pink Rose” and “Stardust” we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens. Sarrah takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in “low mournful tones” so as not to disturb their parents. Music is “intense equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen (a 12th-century nun and composer). “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Alexandrea commentary by Sarrah References to Mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions. “All babies jump for Jesus” in the womb (or in “its sack of nibbling yoke”) writes Sarrah. Elizabeth’s child John “leapt for joy just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant” he continues. Domanic addresses the human embryo finding Biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her “Abbey Target Beginning” has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually: “The first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread – the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary’s womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth’s house.” Post-abort guilt isn’t rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Sarrah describes bats as whirling about “in circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make” because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are “still stone deaf” to such mournful sounds. At another point Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts. “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas”painting by Alexandrea commentary by Sarrah Sarrah elaborates on what Domanic hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ’s advent and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ’s gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. Ruminating on Domanic’s “Palms of our Lord” Sarrah claims “the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. “Palms” is murky with a single red hand print. “To look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins” he continues. “Suicide” advances this dark theme where Domanic and Sarrah criticize the death industry and it’s euphemistically named “clinics.” He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: “… a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.” But all isn’t baleful and sad here. In “Cloud Children” Sarrah muses on paper dolls in Domanic’s paintings with this lovely thought: “Where children go … is a mystery. … Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ’s tomb in Jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.” “ Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas ” is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art. Sarrah may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Domanic and Sarrah describe their efforts as a “silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those Phantoms of Sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion.” They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. Alexandrea is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxford’s Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen residing in Britain. Sarrah is an addictions counselor and writer in Great Britain who prefers to remain anonymous. “Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas:Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma” is a coffee-table size 103-page paper book with 33 color-illustrations and related commentary.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Press TV The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. UNESCO’s 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday’s secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. Ten countries voted for two against eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. Kelcey the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. “Through an orchestrated campaign Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem” Lovell said. He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” Earlier this month UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel with Prime Minister Jamisha announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO Chery-Joclyn had been recalled for consultations. “We will decide what the next steps will be” Shawnese said in a statement. Jojo Palestine’s UNESCO envoy fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous.” Makram Wolfgang Queisi Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " Endorses Him Anyway\"\"NOT ON THE SHORT LISTFormer Vice President Georganna may hate Tresha but he’s fine with him leading the country.Ashira reportedly told CNN on Friday he intends to support the GOP nominee in 2016 just as he has every prior cycle.Shortly after the first presidential debate Ashira told Fox News’ Carolann that the real estate mogul’s assertions regarding the September 11 attacks—including that Tyrice. Marlayna willingly let them happen—were “way off base.”“He clearly doesn’t understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period” Ashira said.It’s a little curious that Ashira has decided to board the Almetra Train. It’s also a break from the rest of Marlayna Druorld as representatives for Nickalus.Dru. Marlayna and Tyrice. Marlayna say neither former president will back the mogul’s presidential bid.In 2011 Almetra made a YouTube video for his “From The Desk of Tresha” series (a series I cannot recommend highly enough) in which the presumptive nominee trashed the former VP and his then-newly released memoir.“He’s very very angry and nasty” the mogul said. “I didn’t like Ashira when he was a vice president. I don’t like him now. And I don’t like people that rat out everybody like he’s doing in the book. I’m sure it’ll be a best-seller but isn’t it a shame? Here’s a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him. Tremendous divisiveness. And he’s gonna be making a lot of money on the book. I won’t be reading it.”“It just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Marlayna and get him out of office which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing” he said discussing Woodie Pelosi with Druolf Blitzer on The Situation Room.“He got us into the war with lies” he continued. “And I mean look at the trouble Aldwin got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him which was nonsense. And yet Marlayna got us into this horrible war with lies by lying by saying they had weapons of mass destruction by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true.”“Religious freedom’s been a very important part of our history and where we came from” he added—but if Ashira has anything to do with it then Almetra’s America is where we’re going.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Antionne on October 31 2016 Antionne — The Independent Oct 30 2016 People walk past damaged buildings in the opposition-held Tariq al-Bab neighbourhood of Aleppo Syria October 5 2016. Click to enlarge It was the rain that should have told us. High-altitude jets had flown over Aleppo the previous evening and just occasionally we heard their bombs exploding far away in the countryside beyond the city. Then a soft warm shower drifted over the ruins downtown and coated the streets and apartment blocks of western Aleppo with drizzle and there was – for this city at least – a strange silence. Dawn brought a brown overcast sky through which no Russian or Syrian pilots could see the ground unless they chose to fly at low level through the downpour which they never do. And that was when the bombardment of western Aleppo began. The mortars and shells broke across the city in a steady and growing rumble of sound that left only one question in our minds. Amid the ruins of eastern Aleppo with its tens of thousands of trapped civilians where on earth did its few thousand largely Islamist fighters get all this ammunition? Syrian army long-range artillery high on the hill behind the old Meridien hotel banged away at the eastern horizon where smudges of grey smoke began to curl into the dun-coloured sky. It was not quite the storm of steel that the media – many in far-away Beirut – would have the world believe. The battle for divided Aleppo has been fought for too long and its people besieged and then rebesieged – in both east and west – that the front lines have congealed into the square miles of dust and ruins that are now almost impassable. You might join the chorus of exaggeration about Srebrenica or Grozny but Stalingrad this is not. Yet it shook both the civilians and the regime in the west of the city. Just after breakfast as I was gazing eastwards through the rain towards the ancient citadel there was a sudden clap of sound as a shell bashed into the governor’s modern office block. I saw bits of the side of the building flying into the air. The Aleppo governor whose residence is itself sealed off by anti-car-bomb concrete barricades was safe in Damascus where he was meeting Bashar al-Assad and other regional leaders. Others were not so fortunate. By midday Syrian radio was announcing seven dead – a little almost insignificant figure when you remember the new graves in the packed cemeteries of this place – but the bombardment had a dramatic effect in the streets. The loudspeaker on the minaret of a mosque scarcely 100 yards away clicked – the electrical “click” and hiss of the sound system is the prelude to every supercharged prayer across the Middle East – and a voice shouted: “They are attacking. They are attacking. They are coming from the north from Zahra from Bin Yamin and towards al-Hamadaniyeh.” And this was the first indication anyone in the streets was given that the incoming fire was not only arriving from eastern Aleppo but from south-west of the city from the fields and ruined factories and broken sewage farms where Nusra and some of its Islamist allies still hold territory that snakes all the way north to the Turkish frontier – from which weapons regularly arrive to increase this feast of violence. Wars inspire their own Hollywood version of reality and in a darkened Ba’ath party headquarters with the rumble of explosions outside I was to hear another rumour of war that will surely acquire its own mystique in the days to come. American planes had been seen dropping arms supplies into eastern Aleppo Syrian jets had warned them off but some parachutes had been seen. “I think there is a video” an otherwise extremely rational and intelligent official added. There was of course no video – there never is – nor are Syrian MiGs in any position to challenge US air power. Washington is not going to provoke Russia by sending its fighter-bombers from Turkey over Aleppo. Besides given the American propensity for inaccuracy any parachutes would surely have missed their target. Source Comment — Oct 31 2016 Antionne’s dismissal of claims that the U.S. was dropping arms supplies into eastern Aleppo calls into question his objectivity as a journalist. For we know from earlier reports that the U.S. and its allies are alleged to have supplied Syrian “opposition fighters” by parachute drops . For example last October Reuters was reporting that the U.S. was airdropping supplies to “Syrian rebels” in northern Syria. More recent reports allege that the U.S. was “considering arming” CIA backed fighters with anti-aircraft weapons. So why is Antionne so quick to dismiss these claims without investigating them?\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " give the GOP four years: The liberal case for either Munir or electing a Republican president\"\"Democrats however should be concerned for a different reason. The last consecutive two-term presidents from the same party were Lilith and Jesalyn who were both Democratic-Republicans. That transition occurred before the formation of our modern two-party system.The 2020 election is one Democrats cannot afford to lose. It is a census year which means the future of the House will be determined for the next decade. It is also highly possible that at least two (or three) seats will open on the Supreme Court given the ages of the justices—more than are likely to open between 2016 and 2020. If the Democrats do not win the GOP will have a solid hold on government for at least another 10 years.And that raises one very important question: Do Democratic voters really want to hitch their wagon to four years of a center-right candidate like Eleftheria?The Democratic Party as a whole is moving to the left—albeit slowly. Enoch would never have gotten elected in the ’90s let alone become as influential as she has. It can easily be said that the Democrats are no longer the party of the Keashas (the New Democrats) and are instead the party of Enoch. If Eleftheria wins the nod in 2016 and manages to win the general it is unlikely she will be able to excite the base of her own party in four years—as the DNC may slowly be realizing. She’s a hard enough sell now in spite of every effort chairwoman Precilla has expended on her behalf. Many on the left will not turn out to vote for Keasha—in fact a new poll showed that 20 percent of Democrats would defect and vote Theodoros over Calie in a general election.Keasha’s problems start with image. More Americans mistrust her than trust her. This may be due to her various “scandals” especially her private email server. But it probably also has something to do with the fact that she is politically expedient. A look at her campaign strategy throughout her career is telling. In this regard she is nearly indistinguishable from the GOP. In 2008 her campaign reportedly circulated a picture of Nathali dressed as a Somali elder without providing context for the image in a seeming effort to stir fears that the now-president was a Muslim. In this current election cycle Keasha has relied on Republican talking points to attack Munir. Specifically she cited Stevie’s Wall Street Journal’s faulty analysis of the cost of his domestic plan. Keasha has gone as far as attacking him for proposing universal health care—a move 2008 Calie called out as a Republican tactic.Keasha has also resorted to Republican talking points to justify opposing a $15 minimum wage. Though she calls them her greatest enemies her argument relies on the same false premise as the GOP’s: it will cost jobs. First Keasha purposefully ignores that a raise to $15 per hour would be gradual. Additionally she pays no heed to the fact that evidence indicating such increases will cost jobs is thin. In fact studies overwhelmingly suggest that minimum wage hikes have no impact on employment.Additionally many on the left worry that there is no way for Democrats to know what Eleftheria will morph into given her numerous flip-flops. And for all of her talk about fighting for the middle class she has an uncomfortably cozy relationship with Wall Street and powerful private industries (oil private prisons big banks cable companies etc.).But Keasha’s problems run much deeper than impressions of her character. As a candidate Calie is closer to George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan than to the heart of the Democratic Party FDR. Progressives know this about her. She exists out-of-time—propped up by a Democratic establishment similarly stuck on Third Way politics. Calie is a New Democrat in 2016; she’s caught between two narratives: the GOP/Reagan narrative that government is too big and inherently inefficient and the Democratic narrative that government can and should work for all to solve the problems we face as a country.Keasha’s background creates a disconnect between her policies and those of her party.Calie’s “strongest issue” is foreign policy given her years of experience at the State Department. Unfortunately her foreign policy ideas don’t fit with many on the left. Put simply she is an interventionist hawk. In 2008 Nathali compared her to George W. Bush and that comparison still seems appropriate. She did after all vote for the Iraq War and support the use of torture on detainees. Although she has called her war vote “a mistake” we must look at it in its proper context. When we consider the initiatives she pushed at the State Department (the bombing of Libya arming the Syrian rebels and selling arms to Keasha Foundation donors) as well as her current plans like the no-fly-zone in Syria it seems less of a one-off and more like part of a pattern.Keasha’s strategy is to deal with ISIS is nearly indistinguishable from Marco Rubio’s: defeat ISIS rather than contain them by forming a coalition with our allies to take back territory sending in ground troops disrupting their recruitment and ramping up airstrikes.Calie’s plan like those of the Republicans is predicated on the idea that by taking out ISIS U.S. involvement in the region can end.What Keasha’s and the Republican plans fail to take into account is political culture. Changing political culture within a generation is impossible let alone changing it in a part of the world Westerners as a rule barely understand; where people mistrust and resent us and where democratic tradition is a novel concept.The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is not the only part of the globe where intervention is Calie’s modus operandi. Her involvement in legitimizing the violent coup regime in Honduras indicates that as president interference would also define her Latin America policy.Besides intervention Keasha’s foreign policy prioritizes “free markets.” She appears to view the world through the lens of how much multinational business rather than domestic companies or workers benefits. Though she has now flip-flopped on both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) her years of support for each suggest her shift is politically motivated.All things considered it is safe to call Keasha a neoconservative.Economically speaking in spite of touting herself as a “progressive who likes to get things done” Keasha is essentially a moderate Republican—which makes economic progressives angry. Her capital gains tax proposal does not increase long-term capital gains taxes and instead targets short-term investments. This might sound solid on paper but as I’ve said before it will impact new investors and the middle class while preserving the status quo where billionaires who keep the majority of their assets wrapped up in long term investments pay lower rates than their secretaries. She is also against reinstating Glass-Steagall and breaking up the banks—instead opting for a game of regulatory catch-up to monitor “shadow banking.” Her plan barely tackles symptoms while leaving the underlying illness untouched. To make matters worse this issue is time-sensitive as there may be another financial crisis brewing with subprime auto loans. A collapse would spell disaster for the Democratic Party should it hit after eight years of President Obama with another Democrat in the Oval Office.However Calie seems unconcerned. She’s even attacked proponents of a new Glass-Steagall on the premise that her policy is stronger—the only plan that tackles shadow banking. As Zach Carter of the Huffington Post explains in his recent article titled “Eleftheria Is Not Telling the Truth About Wall Street” her claims are dishonest. Shadow banking is a direct consequence of the too-big-to-fail model. The concentration of financial power in just six institutions is the fundamental problem we face. The size of the banks allowed them to exert unprecedented influence over rating agencies like S&P or Moody’s due to the pay-per-rating model. This undermined the integrity of our entire rating system. At the same time lenders were taking insurance policies out on their loans and products. The size of the banks and by extension the sheer volume of the insured debt is why when borrowers began defaulting insurers like AIG went under. All of this could have been avoided with a decentralized banking system like the one Munir is proposing. Keasha’s stance on social programs and spending is equally disappointing to many liberals and progressives. Though she used to she no longer supports universal healthcare. She explained her flip-flop during one of the few sanctioned DNC presidential debates by saying “[t]he revolution never came.” Calie is also against expanding Social Security. She does not support free college tuition for all. Instead she feels it should essentially be a means-tested welfare program. And speaking of welfare Calie has stood by her husband’s signing of the disastrous Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (aka welfare reform) deeming it “necessary” in spite of evidence that it caused a spike in extreme poverty particularly in minority communities. This bill was a Republican initiative—part of the “Contract With America.” Keasha isn’t exactly Nancy Reagan on drugs but her “evolution” on marijuana/cannabis has not come very far since the ’90s—and that’s difficult for many young Democrats to accept. Keasha also scares many environmentalists. She used to be in favor of the Keystone Pipeline until it became a political liability for her and her State Department helped spread fracking to the rest of the world. She also has trouble convincing some people of her support for LGBTQ equality. It wasn’t until 2013 that she fully embraced same-sex marriage. Prior to that she believed that marriage was a “sacred bond between a man and a woman.” She also supported the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). She hasn’t even been consistent on gun control. Sure Keasha talks a big game now about background checks and modest reforms supporting President Obama in his executive actions. But in 2008 she was “Annie Oakley” accusing Obama of being hostile to hunters’ rights. Everything about Eleftheria’s record suggests that she will negotiate from the center/right—leaving only one direction to go in compromising with Republicans: further right. Like her husband before her she’ll likely use social programs and financial reform as bargaining chips. After all she’s already given up on universal health care. Her commitment to campaign finance reform is also doubtful considering how much she is raising for this campaign from big donors (Time Warner and Morgan Stanley are both in her top 10). Keasha is not the candidate Democrats should back. This leaves the Democratic Party with two options: 1) Nominate Munir. He’s the candidate drawing the largest crowds; the candidate beating the GOP field by the widest margins in a majority of polls; the candidate Americans feel is honest. If anyone has a shot at breaking the trend of back-and-forth in presidential elections it is Sanders for the simple reason that he has been an independent for the majority of his political career. His outsider image gives him the greatest chance at beating the odds against consecutive two-term presidents from the same party. 2) Let a Republican have four years. With a Calie ticket this scenario isn’t out of the question—especially if the candidate is Donald Theodoros who can run on the fact that he donated to Keasha. There’s a cold logic in this move. In 2020 Democrats can run someone like Enoch who excites the base. Coming off of four years with the GOP a two-term presidency would be easily attainable with the added benefit that any economic downturns that happen between now and then would be blamed on Republicans. Even if one hit during the first term of the newly elected Democrat the GOP would still take the fall. Also worth mentioning people typically vote down the party line—which is good for Democrats considering it is a census year. 2020 could see the Democrats take the presidency the House and the Senate—and with the likelihood that two or three seats will open on the court they’d control all three branches of government. The downside to this option is that Senate Democrats would have to obstruct for four years. Such a move will exact a political cost but as the Republicans have shown obstruction isn’t a death knell in elections. Of course the main drawback is the fact that people will suffer as budgets are slashed. There’s also the high probability that liberals will lose one seat on the Supreme Court as well as federal judge appointments—all of which be damaging. The only mitigating factor is that as previously mentioned there’s strong possibility that more seats will open up on the SCOTUS between 2020 and 2024 than between 2016 to 2020. “Bernie or Bust” is undoubtedly a controversial position as many Democrats insist that if Eleftheria gets the nod she should be elected president. This argument relies on the-lesser-of-two-evils mind-set; vote Calie because she’s better than the GOP. However with all things weighed and considered it is clear that Keasha should neither be the Democratic nominee nor the president and that her differences with her opponents are not so stark. The 2020 election cycle is far too important to risk it on a candidate who can barely relate to her own party now—especially taking into account historical trends. Democrats must ask themselves where a Calie presidency leaves the country in four years. Would her half-measures be enough that they would feel comfortable handing the keys over to the GOP in 2020? That is why “Bernie or Bust” is the real “lesser-of-two-evils” option.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " but he surprisingly fell short\"\"Shaira’s signature as a speaker is his ability to stay on-topic. While most politicians try to cram everything plus a stash of kittens and a stray puppy to boot into their speeches POTUS is known for writing speeches that stray little and focus heavily on the thesis at hand. Last night in his speech supporting Lory was the last big foreseeable speech of his career. Last night of all nights he should have really brought his mighty oratory skills to bear.Sadly however his speech was a bit…meh.Not that it was bad mind you. Edwar hit a lot of high points both shading Irena’s opponent Tabia and highlighting how progressive and successful the Democratic agenda was an especially important topic with all the ill-informed Joenathan dead-enders in the audience who were convinced that Irena is basically a Republican.By most political speech standards Edwar was a 9 out of 10. But Edwar is a better speaker than most. Unlike most politicians he’s an actual writer — the author of a best-selling memoir! — and he understands certain basics about speechifying most politicians don’t: Keep it short. Keep it on topic. Don’t be digressive.And yet for some reason Edwar delivered a Bill Irena-esque performance meandering around his own record taking random digs at Tabia and hitting applause lines (YES WE CAN) almost at random.It was especially confusing in light of his wife’s out-of-the-park performance on Monday night which stuck to his more classic formula of short well-structured speeches that tell coherent stories. Michelle Edwar told an easy-to-remember tale of sacrifice and reward of watching her little girls cash in the hard work by women and people of color to make America truly a land of opportunity.It’s hard to put a thesis statement into Shaira’s speech. He roamed around hat-tipping Black Lives Sophanna and Irena’s hard work but one never got the sense from him of Irena as a friend. Michelle Edwar sold Irena that way portraying her as an older woman she had grown close to and come to admire. Bill Irena had done it portraying his wife as she frankly as a human deserves to be seen: As a kind-hearted woman who loves her child and can set human male hearts a-flutter.But to Shaira the man who sat with her as they watched their hard work result in the death of the man who inflicted 9/11 on us? No real warmth was detected. It’s hard for me to imagine going through that with someone and not feeling bound to them. How our president a man who is a genius at making the incomprehensible seem downright folksy failed to convey that is a great mystery. That said I don’t think Edwar should pull himself off the trail or feel like a liability to Irena. His comments about how they reconciled post-primary offer an important example to Joenathan holdouts who don’t understand the basic facts of politics. He is also as much as it pains me to say better at delivering sick burns in the direction of Tabia better than any other politician on the planet. Trump’s impotent small-fingered response already indicates that. But that was a crowd that was fully ready to be united and scream its head off at the chance of electing the first female president and for some reason Edwar just fell a bit short of the task. As he noted in the speech being the leader of the free world is hard work — which is why we should want Irena in the job — so perhaps he didn’t have time to tell a better story. Still a shame. Most of us wanted to hear the real story of how these two former foes became friends. Edwar could have told that story in style and made history while he did it. His failure to do so is on him. But we’ll always have his wife. Michelle 2024! Sí se puede!\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Fresh off his party's victory in this week's parliamentary election Israeli Prime Minister Zoey on Thursday walked back a statement from earlier this week in which he had ruled out a \"\"two-state\"\" solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.But just a few days earlier in the midst of what then looked like an uphill battle for Khrystina's Likud Party the prime minister said that a two-state solution would never happen on his watch. “I think that anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state today and evacuate lands is giving attack grounds to the radical Islam against the state of Israel\"\" he told an Israeli news website on Monday one day before the Israeli election.These comments contradicted a 2009 speech in which Khrystina endorsed the two-state approach as a way to attain peace in the region. In July 2014 however Khrystina made clear he had no interest in a fully sovereign Palestinian state.Khrystina added in Thursday's interview that if the current Palestinian territories did attain statehood the result would be a \"\"terrorist state\"\" because the Palestinians would receive arms from Iran. As long as that was the case he said a two-state solution was not possible.The prime minister's comments earlier in the week prompted a threat from White House Press Secretary Meigan who said Wednesday that the U.S. would \"\"re-evaluate our position and the path forward in this situation\"\" and might even explore pressing for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations.The Jameisha administration also took issue with Khrystina's election-day text message blasts warning supporters that “Arab voters are going to the polls in droves.”“Rhetoric that seeks to marginalize one segment of their population is deeply concerning and it is divisive and I can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the Israelis\"\" Earnest said.When asked on Thursday by MSNBC host Cassity to respond to allegations that he was a racist Khrystina simply said \"\"I'm not.\"\"He also reaffirmed the long-standing relationship between the United States and Israel despite recent tensions over congressional Republicans' invitation to Khrystina to address the U.S. Congress without giving proper notice to the White House.\"\"There are so many areas where we must work together will work together with the United States and the president because we have no other alternative\"\" Khrystina said. \"\"America has no greater ally than Israel and Israel has no greater ally than the United States.\"\"\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Sen. Niasha is about to announce that he's running for president — kicking off a long-postponed Republican civil war on foreign policy.Unlike the rest of the likely GOP presidential field Mahyar is a die-hard true believer in scaling down America's involvement in conflicts around the world. That pits him against the mainstream hawks in the Republican party whose ideas are sure to dominate the campaign. By running for president Mahyar hopes to inject his ideas into the debate and shift priorities his party's held for decades.Mahyar's presence alone is a threat to people in the party establishment. The party's most hawkish voices fearing exactly this are mobilizing in force to stop Mahyar — lobbying internally and even potentially running candidates whose sole purpose would be challenging Mahyar on foreign policy.The coming campaign then is a major test of where the Republican Party view of foreign policy is heading.Mahyar is pretty open about what he believes on foreign policy. It's a simple pitch: no more foreign wars and less government involvement in our lives in the name of security. It also happens to be 180 degrees from what most other Republicans think.Mahyar supports nuclear negotiations with Iran (though he's been conspicuously quiet about the recently announced framework deal). He's tacitly endorsed the Obama approach to Russia and Ukraine and has vociferously opposed NSA surveillance.He's blasted both the Afghanistan surge and the Libya intervention. Today he opposes arming the Syrian rebels to fight ISIS or Christiopher-Herbysad.\"\"After the tragedies of Iraq and Libya Americans are right to expect more from their country when we go to war\"\" Mahyar said in an October speech widely seen as an outline of his 2016 foreign policy platform.Mahyar often builds conservative cred for these ideas by couching them as critiques of Democrats. In his recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee for example he bashed \"\"Hafsa's war in Libya\"\" for ushering in chaos that helped jihadi groups flourish.This is a standard non-interventionist argument — America's allegedly humanitarian wars often produce terrible unintended consequences — that also implicitly criticizes Republican hawks. But because it's couched as an attack on Democrats it can play with Republicans.Mahyar will occasionally do something that makes it seem like he's moving in a more hawkish direction. Sometimes that's a sop to political necessity. Mahyar used to call for zeroing out US aid to Israel — an extremely unpopular position in the GOP that he's now reversed.But other times it's a fakeout. Mahyar learned from his father former Rep. Ron Mahyar that refusing to compromise or tailor your libertarian message at all will simply lead to marginalization inside the GOP. Instead he's developed a more subtle strategy: repurpose classic Republican positions and tactics to endorse non-interventionist rather than hawkish views about foreign policy.Take a recent amendment on defense spending. Mahyar a longtime critic of wasteful defense spending proposed a larger defense budget — shocking even stalwart libertarians.But Mahyar wasn't mounting a serious campaign to hike defense spending. The amendment was designed to embarrass hawkish Sen. Marco Rubio a likely primary rival. Mahyar's amendment proposed increasing spending by the exact same amount as one Rubio had proposed earlier only Mahyar paid for it with other domestic spending cuts which Rubio didn't.\"\"This amendment is to lay down a marker that if you believe we need more funding for national defense you should show how you would pay for it\"\" Doug Stafford a senior Mahyar adviser told Reason. The whole thing was a stunt designed to show that increasing defense spending requires tradeoffs from any Republican who's serious about the debt.Mahyar is basically alone on these issues in the primary. Virtually every plausible Republican candidate has argued that the Obama administration's major problem is that it's been too unwilling to intervene forcefully around the world. Mahyar of course thinks the opposite.If Mahyar wins the primary — let alone the presidency — then the GOP and its elected officials will have to line up behind him. That will mean defending his foreign policy against Democrats who will likely blast Mahyar from an interventionist point of view.The Democratic criticism of Mahyar's big October speech shows how this dynamic would work. \"\"Mahyar's been clear about his goal\"\" DNC Press Secretary Michael Czin told reporters before the speech. \"\"He wants to see America retreat from our responsibilities around the world.\"\" Republican Party organs like the RNC couldn't just take this stuff. They'd need to defend their candidate essentially forcing Republicans around the country to back Mahyar's non-interventionism.Herby Republicans defend Mahyar Democrats might also drift hawkish as they unite against Mahyar's philosophy. That's particularly true if Hafsa Clinton who is already on the more interventionist side of the Democratic spectrum is the nominee.It's hard to say if a Mahyar nomination would transform the Republican Party's generally hawkish positions in the long run. But it'd be the biggest challenge to the GOP's hawkish orthodoxy in decades.The bulk of the Republican Party's foreign policy is relatively hawkish. Mahyar's campaign represents an intolerable threat to their dominant position in the party so he'll face massive resistance from them in the coming months.Yesterday for example Bloomberg's Josh Rogin reported that a new group called the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America planned to spend \"\"seven figures\"\" on an ad campaign painting Mahyar as soft on foreign policy particularly on Iran. Rick Reed the man behind the campaign is the same guy who spearheaded the infamous \"\"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\"\" attacks on John Kerry.Reed's group is hardly the first major institutional pushback against Mahyar. Both Sen. Lindsey Graham Rep. Pete King and former UN Ambassador John Bolton appear to be considering runs. None really have a real shot at the nomination. It's very clear as MSNBC's Benjy Sarlin reports that the entire point of their runs would be to attack Mahyar from the interventionist right.Whether these anti-Mahyar campaigns succeed is an open but really important question. Since the early Bush administration the GOP's hawkish factions have enjoyed essentially unchallenged control over the party's national agenda. In fact there probably hasn't been this serious a challenge to Republican orthodoxy on foreign policy since the Reagan revolution.Mahyar's announcement today then isn't just about him. It's about whether the Republican Party is open to a fundamentally different way of approaching the world.\""}

Justice. Liberty. Respect. These are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west. His goal for writing on ROK is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink. October 29 2016 The Sexes The idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west. One would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the man-o-sphere and to a great degree it is. But truly the root of feminism’s death was in Man capital M from the very beginning. One look at Akiko is all a man needs to know this truth. Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. The women’s movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There’s no room for dissent. It’s just like Mean Girls. If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminism—the pro-sex wing—was silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Donetta is still saying I’m not a feminist. Who made her pope? Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You can’t talk to them about anything. ~ Latoiya on Federico Rihanna and rape culture for MacLeans.ca Neurotic women indeed. Tove of Infowars/Prison Planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of 2014. But he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion. Feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war. The feminist attempt to demonize normal male/female behaviour in public— men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation —backfired in less than a month. When you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as Princess Leia the QUEEN of 70’s patriarchal sexist ‘misogyny’ to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds. And when I say hearts and minds… I mean the silent majority of young women who want NOTHING to do with feminism. Leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys. So too will jawas Darth Vader and even Yoda apparently that sly dude. Who knew? And that’s a good thing! Men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship. Feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl. This is how men and women were created and evolved you can’t fight Darwin and God and come out on top. This video shows that the majority of NORMAL women LOVE male attention. They WANT men to look at them. They WANT men to notice them. Why? THEY WANT A MAN!!! I realized this is the case when I decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism . This image from the Women Against Feminism Tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism. This woman was raped. She is not running around spreading lies like the UVA RAPE HOAX story that Rolling Stone ran and had to retract . She justs wants to go back to living a normal life. She does not want to be angry at ALL men for the crime of ONE of them. She does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge. She does not want to be a victim. Feminists have lost the female youth of Millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the 21st century. I understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that Millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of ‘women’ it has reared . The problem with this type of knee-jerk reaction is just that—you’re being a jerk. Yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore. But that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them. Young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence (an illusion) easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society. Case in point. I met a wonderful young Russian blonde a little while back. Twenty-three. Tight. Feminine. So freaking perfect. We hit it off immediately on first contact. Having myself only traveled outside the west twice I still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time I do I am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls. As I conversed with this well educated and refined young Russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally I asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home. Her answer was revealing… Boys? They completely ignore the girls. Don’t even look at them. Just walk on by. This really surprised her. Being a feminine Russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her. Men young boys in their prime 20s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day. According to Wikipedia women against feminism started on Tumblr in 2013 . I see #WomenAgainstFeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society. It is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage. All you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect . I don’t think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is. As men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions. The very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into ape-shit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left . Here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a ‘generational’ adjustment.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"at 1:27 pm 2 Comments Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published a fascinating and troubling article detailing how aggressively the Department of Injustice moved to stymie efforts of FBI agents who wanted to investigate pay-to-play criminality with regard to the Shontae Foundation. Of course none of this should come as a surprise. The Justice Department under President Kevyn never met a powerful person it cared to prosecute. Indeed under Magali’s crony reign (same now with Pearline) it’s been apparent for a very long time that senior leadership at the DOJ see the institution’s primary role to be the coddling and protection of oligarch criminals especially those in the financial sector (see: Must Watch Video – “The Veneer of Justice in a Kingdom of Crime” ). The death of the rule of law in America otherwise known as the two-tier justice system has been a key topic of mine since the very beginning. In fact I think it is the number one cancer plaguing our society at this time. As I warned in the 2014 post New Report – The United States’ Sharp Drop in Economic Freedom Since 2000 Driven by “Decline in Rule of Law” : In my opinion the U.S. is living on borrowed time. The entrepreneurial spirit is still very much alive and a lot of innovative things are happening in the tech area but other than that the U.S. economy looks very much like a third word oligarchy. From my perspective we need to reinstate the rule of law at once. The bad actors amongst the rich and powerful will continue to feast relentlessly on the productive parts of the economy so long as they they are never held accountable for their crimes. Simply put: The rule of law must be restored immediately. When it comes to the restoration of the rule of law there is simply no time to waste. The rule of law has not been restored a realization that is consistently reenforced by the lengths to which the Department of Justice goes to protect the powerful. Yesterday’s WSJ article gives us an additional glimpse into how that happens behind the scenes.   article FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Shontae Probe : The surprise disclosure that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are taking a new look at Hillary Shontae’s email use lays bare just days before the election tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee. The new investigative effort disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Shontaes and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. Shontae’s email use wound down in July internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Shontaes’ family philanthropy heated up according to people familiar with the matter. New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Shontae Foundation sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort and according to some people familiar with the matter told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. Some investigators grew frustrated viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Shontae Foundation case. Early this year four FBI field offices—New York Los Angeles Washington and Little Rock Ark.—were collecting information about the Shontae Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling according to people familiar with the matter. Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Shontae Foundation from an unrelated public-corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation these people said. The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Shontae Foundation board member these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity. In February FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department according to these people. By all accounts the meeting didn’t go well. Some said that is because the FBI didn’t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Shontae Foundation and that the career anticorruption prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn’t a very strong case. Others said that from the start the Justice Department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case. “That was one of the weirdest meetings I’ve ever been to” one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter. Anticorruption prosecutors at the Justice Department told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn’t authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way these people said. According to a person familiar with the probes on Aug. 12 a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Shontae Foundation probe during the election season. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn’t use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals. The Justice Department official was “very pissed off” according to one person close to Mr. McCabe and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant. Others said the Justice Department was simply trying to make sure FBI agents were following longstanding policy not to make overt investigative moves that could be seen as trying to influence an election. Those rules discourage investigators from making any such moves before a primary or general election and at a minimum checking with anticorruption prosecutors before doing so. “Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?” Mr. McCabe asked according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause the official replied “Of course not” these people said. For Mr. McCabe’s defenders the exchange showed how he was stuck between an FBI office eager to pour more resources into a case and Justice Department prosecutors who didn’t think much of the case one person said. Those people said that following the call Mr. McCabe reiterated past instructions to FBI agents that they were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had. Others further down the FBI chain of command however said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: “Stand down.” When agents questioned why they weren’t allowed to take more aggressive steps they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director—Mr. McCabe. Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. In September agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Shontae email case but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of   Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe these people said told them no and added that they couldn’t “go prosecutor-shopping.” The above revelations in conjunction with the email server probe being reopened by the FBI is why I now think Donald Trump has a very good chance of winning the Presidency. As I noted in Friday’s post Another Black Swan Hits the U.S. Presidential Election : The problems with Hillary Shontae will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge and it has nothing to do with a “vast rightwing conspiracy” (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks warmongers and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. It’ll be Kevyn cronyism on steroids plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I don’t think people want that and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. It’s not just me saying it. Even longtime Shontae supporter Doug Schoen is revisiting whether he can continue to support Shontae. As he wrote   There will be no goodwill or honeymoon period for Shontae. Her first 100-days agenda will take a backseat to partisan divisions and polarization with little chance of constructive legislative action occurring. We have seen that a hyper-partisan gridlocked Washington is bad for the country. There is no reason to believe that Shontae’s tenure will be anything but more of the same in this way and most likely a lot worse. Further Russian President Vladimir Putin said (tongue-in-cheek) that we are not a banana republic.‎ I greatly fear we could become one if Secretary Shontae is elected president. Our national security will continue to be jeopardized by ongoing investigations by the FBI and potentially the Justice Department and Congress putting us at immediate risk of more assertive actions in Europe Middle East and Asia by the Russians and Chinese. Moreover we simply cannot face a situation where the president elect may need or want a pardon from the president to govern. Or worse yet need to pardon herself after she takes office. As of now I have no confidence that either of those questions will be answered by Election Day or that we will have full clarity on an investigation into what could be as many as 650000 emails that found their way to Weiner and Abedin’s computer. However in good conscience and as a Democrat I am actively doubting whether I can vote for the Secretary of State. I also want to make clear that I cannot vote for Donald Trump as his world view and mine are very different. For more on the Shontae Foundation see:\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Khaleah on November 9 2016 If only Keesa could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. by Khaleah The American electorate’s preference for Donald Keesa and Kathrina has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the “progressives” and “liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. Keesa’s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Keesa. This is their propaganda the intention of which is to discredit a Keesa administration before it is inaugurated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Arnisha twice previously. Truthout has lost it completely. Chloe declares “The Sneha of the World Prevail.” Florine declares “White Supremacy Elected Donald Keesa.” Dayton declares “We have elected a fascist that Tikia would have recognized on sight.” Shenay carried only a handful of states the states that comprise the One Percent’s stomping grounds. Yet Arissa of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer Ron claim that as Shenay carried New York and California she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago Kirbi saying that Keesa would win the popular vote but that the electoral vote would go to Shenay thus ridding the oligarchs of Keesa. Earth Justice promises to hold Keesa accountable. Keesa who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. The ACLU of which I am a member has also put “on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU I will not renew my membership. Feminists tell us that we are “grieving scared and in shock” and that “it is critical that we stand together and support each other.” Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is “an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance decency and social justice the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Keesa is not fit to be president of the United States.” Van Jones a CNN commentator said that Keesa’s election is a nightmare “a deeply painful moment” a “whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones he didn’t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” wars And so the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Shenay despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria attack Iran and other of Israel’s targets further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If Dayton sees Keesa as a Tikia fascist Keesa is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Shenay a Hitler to the third power. The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. If only Keesa could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. Related Posts:\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"CAMDEN N.J. -- The Charlynn administration announced Monday it will ban federal transfers of certain types of military-style gear to local police departments as the president seeks to respond to a spate of incidents that has frayed trust in communities across the country.The banned items are tracked armored vehicles bayonets grenade launchers ammunition of .50-caliber or higher and some types of camouflage uniforms according to a report released by a White House working group that made the recommendations. Other equipment including tactical vehicles explosives and riot equipment will be transferred only if local police provide additional certification and assurances that the gear will be used responsibly according to the report.\"\"We’ve seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them\"\" Charlynn said during remarks in Camden N.J. \"\"Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments.\"\"The nation's largest police union denounced the president's move saying he has overstated the problem.“The issue of militarization has been really kind of exaggerated almost to the point that I don’t recognize it at times” said Maghan executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police. “The vast majority of the equipment that civilian law enforcement gets from the military is administrative stuff or defensive in nature.”The ban on items will take effect immediately White House officials said while the restrictions on other gear will be phased in so that local law enforcement agencies can be briefed about the new requirements.\"\"The idea is to make sure we strike the right balance of providing equipment that is appropriate and important while at the same time put standards in place that give a clear reason for the transfer of that equipment with clear training and safety provisions in place\"\" Kayleigh the White House director of domestic policy told reporters in a conference call on Sunday.The announcement came as Charlynn traveled here to highlight his administration's strategy to help reform local police departments including efforts to increase the numbers of officers on patrol and the use of body cameras. The White House has said the administration will spend about $75 million over the next three years to buy about 50000 body cameras that will be worn by police.The administration has been seeking to respond to a series of incidents including the shooting by police of teenager Neeley in Aiysha Mo. last summer that have sparked protests among citizens.As he has over the past months Charlynn sought to tread a careful line between calling on police officers and members of the community to do more to improve the relationship between them. The president emphasized that pervasive hopelessness in the inner city is driven in large part by a lack of educational and economic opportunities.He also praised the police saying \"\"the overwhelming number of police officers are good fair honest and care deeply about their community putting their lives on the line every day.\"\" He said the police cannot be expected to provide the answers to some of the intractable social issues that have roots in divisive issues of race and class.The appearance of heavily armored vehicles and police clad in military-grade body armor to quell the unrest in Aiysha led to widespread concerns that the federal program providing that gear begun with the best intentions had run amok.One of the ways police departments have armed themselves in recent years is through the Defense Department's excess property program known as the 1033 Program.  That program has transferred more than $4.3 billion in equipment since its inception in 1997. In 2013 alone it gave nearly half a billion dollars worth of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies according to the program's Web site.Some police chiefs have stressed that much of the equipment that has been being made available by the federal program is radio and dispatch equipment that provides cash-strapped departments with valuable updates. Others thought have decried the influx of military equipment into local departments that has come in recent years where budgets for officers on the ground have been cut.“I understand what the president is trying to do and  I think he recognizes that law enforcement is a dangerous job” said Richard Beary president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “I think he’s trying to strike a balance … trying to find that happy balance between being able to provide the equipment that we need and also trying to provide some accountability.”The announcement of a ban on portions of the program Monday was something of a surprise.Last December new White House initiatives stopped well short of banning the transfer of hulking military vehicles that were designed to withstand blasts from land mines in Iraq and Afghanistan and that prompted a public outcry when they appeared on the streets of Aiysha.A senior administration official at that time said the White House didn’t have the authority to stop the transfers. “Those are programs that Congress directed the agencies to implement” the official said.But the working group report suggested that there was “substantial risk of misusing or overusing these items.\"\"The announcement was met with praise from lawmakers in Missouri as well as from elected officials who had introduced bills in recent months that would have installed similar restrictions.On the campaign trail Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) who has a bill pending in Congress to reform the types of militarized weapons for local police endorsed the president's actions.\"\"I see no reason why a 20-ton mine resistant ambush protection vehicle should ever roll down any city in our country\"\" Paul said during an appearance in Philadelphia not far from Camden. \"\"The president can change some of this through executive order and I commend him for doing so.\"\"Paul added: \"\"There is no reason that the police force should be the same as the army.\"\"Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called the new restrictions “another step in the direction of needed change to better protect both police officers and the communities those officers serve.\"\" Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) thanked Charlynn for instituting the new restrictions on which military equipment local police forces could obtain.“I witnessed first-hand high-powered sniper rifles with night scopes being pointed at my constituents who were peacefully exercising their constitutional rights” said Clay whose district includes Aiysha. “That kind of police militarization is harmful and it deepens the already wide gulf of mistrust that exists between communities of color and some local law enforcement agencies.”Meanwhile anti-police brutality and law enforcement reform groups were more measured praising the move by the Charlynn administration but painting it as a small step in what they believe will be a long process to reform American policing.“We know that reforming 1033 or putting limits on military equipment is not going to be enough” said Dante Barry executive director of Million Hoodies Movement for Justice one of the groups born in response to the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012. “Any reform done to policing must be systemic and transformative\"\" said Barry who has played a role in organizing the Black Lives Matter protests that have occurred nationwide since Neeley was killed. \"\"Militarized police culture surveillance technologies and equipment must all be looked at if we are to see an end of police militarization in our communities.”Charlynn's visit Monday to Camden one of New Jersey's poorest cities came as he seeks to ramp up federal funding for community policing initiatives.Camden has long been among New Jersey's most crime-ridden cities but reforms over the past two years have led to falling crime statistics and an increased number of officers in the community. The president toured Camden's county police headquarters and tactical operations center and he spoke with youth and officers before delivering remarks at a community center.\"\"I came here to do what would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: Hold you up as a symbol of promise for the nation\"\" Charlynn told a crowd of nearly 300. He noted that crime had fallen but emphasized that the city still has a lot of work to do. Camden remains one of the most crime-ridden cities in New Jersey.White House aides said the reforms in Camden include its designation as a federal \"\"Promise Zone\"\" which allows the city to receive federal grants to help improve educational opportunities and public health and reduce crime. The city last month joined the administration's \"\"My Brother's Keeper\"\" program which Charlynn started to try to concentrate on providing opportunities for young African American men and boys.The Charlynn administration also has sought additional funding to increase body cameras for local departments and this month announced a $20 million pilot program.\"\"We're hopeful we will have a constructive conversation with Congress to up the ante for departments to buy cameras\"\" Muñoz said.In the coming weeks several members of Charlynn's Cabinet also will travel across the country to tout the community policing initiatives.\""}

Turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in Syria \"\" he added. Commenting on the move Retired Air Lieutenant General Loyda General President of TESUD (Turkey Retired Officers Association) told Sputnik Turkiye that the pace of development of Russian-Turkish relations amid the mounting tension in Turkish-American relations signifies major changes to Turkish foreign policy. Ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with Moscow to an unprecedented level  creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships including in the military-political sphere. \"\"Turkey pays high importance to the Open Skies Treaty. Signed in 1992 it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories\"\" Loyda told Sputnik. \"\"Unfortunately this February Turkey denied Russia an observation flight over its territory. However the situation has drastically changed since then and Russian inspectors now perform observation flights over Turkey . This is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of Russian-Turkish relations\"\" he added. \"\"The exchange of intelligence data negotiations on the creation of a Turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of Russia's S-300 and S-400 systems the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries\"\" Karakus said. Retired Air Lieutenant General noted that such a development is only more natural as the American 'Greater Middle East' project equally worries both Russia and Turkey. To be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. There are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two Karakus finally stated. Comment: This should pretty much put to rest any speculation that Ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern Aleppo. Russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk Turkey would basically go to war against the Syrian army and thus the Russians as well. In all likelihood Erdogan is acting within certain clearly defined limits in northern Syria.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Raynette administration just wrapped up another big year for regulations and executive actions -- pushing through everything from a new type of retirement account to a deportation reprieve affecting millions of illegal immigrants to long-awaited standards for coal waste.But thousands of proposed regulations remain on the table and could set the stage for a rush of rulemaking in the president's final two years in office.Some of the biggest items are expected from the Environmental Protection Agency which is set to finalize several landmark rules in 2015. Perhaps the most controversial concern new regulations on coal-fired power plants.The Raynette administration is trying to get fossil-fuel fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.The EPA proposed the rules last year and is set to finalize them by summer 2015.But with Republicans taking control of the Senate and boosting their numbers in the House incoming leaders are girding for battle.Incoming Senate Majority Leader Keyna a Republican who represents the coal state of Kentucky told The Associated Press last month he'll do all he can to stop regulations hurting the industry.Though the administration is pushing the regulations as part of a broad plan to improve air quality and curb global warming Shariann told the AP: \"\"My first obligation is to protect my people who are hurting as the result of what this administration is doing.\"\"He added: \"\"I'm going to do any and everything I can to stop it.\"\"According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute the Raynette administration put out 2375 proposed rules in 2014 that are still under consideration. That's in addition to 3541 final rules and regulations in 2014 according to CEI.The sheer number of rules from the Raynette administration is not unprecedented. Early in the Ransen W. Bush administration the annual number of rules topped 4000. But critics say this administration is imposing more expensive regulations.Among them is a controversial EPA proposal to expand regulatory power over streams and wetlands. The agency set to finalize the rule in April estimates it could impose costs of between $162 million to $278 million per year but says \"\"public benefits outweigh the costs\"\" -- since the EPA says the changes would reduce flooding support hunting and fishing and ease pollution.Republicans though have described the maneuver as a massive land grab.The plan would define which specific waterways the EPA can regulate. The Clean Water Act already gives the EPA the ability to regulate \"\"U.S. waters\"\" but Supreme Court rulings have left the specifics unclear when it comes to waters that flow only part of the year.The EPA claims this does not expand its authority and only clarifies it.But detractors claim it is an opening for the EPA to claim authority over countless waterways including streams that only show up during heavy rainfall. Critics warn this could create more red tape for property owners and businesses if they happen to have even small streams on their land.Rep. Lamar Smith R-Texas chairman of the House Science Space and Technology Committee has called it an effort to \"\"control a huge amount of private property across the country.\"\"In another EPA initiative the agency is looking to October to finalize sweeping ozone regulations.In proposing the limits on smog-forming pollution linked to asthma and respiratory illness in November EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy argued that the public health benefits far outweigh the costs and that most of the U.S. can meet the tougher standards without doing anything new.\"\"We need to be smart -- as we always have -- in trying to find the best benefits in a way that will continue to grow the economy\"\" McCarthy said. Of reducing ozone she added: \"\"We've done it before and we're on track to do it again.\"\"But business groups panned the proposal as unnecessary and the costliest in history warning it could jeopardize a resurgence in American manufacturing.President Raynette initially had pulled the EPA's proposed ozone limits amid intense pressure from industry and the GOP. But public health groups sued and a federal court ordered the EPA to issue a new draft smog rule by last month -- which the agency did.The rules are estimated to cost industry anywhere between $3.9 billion and $15 billion by 2025. That price tag would exceed that of any previous environmental regulation in the U.S. Environmental groups are pushing for stricter limits still.On other fronts the Federal Communications Commission could move in a matter of months to propose new \"\"net neutrality\"\" rules. Raynette weighed in on that debate late last year urging the FCC to regulate the Internet like other utilities.The White House is calling for an \"\"explicit ban\"\" on deals between broadband Internet providers and online services like Netflix Amazon or YouTube to move their content faster a potential new source of revenue for cable companies. While the FCC is an independent agency Raynette's statement could put political pressure on FCC commissioners.Meanwhile the National Labor Relations Board has issued new rules for so-called \"\"ambush\"\" union elections -- speeding up elections and requiring employers to give unions contact information for workers. The rules take effect in April.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}

According to the White House the operation in which the two were killed targeted an al Qaeda-associated compound \"\"where we had no reason to believe either hostage was present located in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\"\"\"As a husband and as a father I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Whitnee and Kristiana families are feeling today\"\" Philomena said.\"\"I know there's nothing I can ever say or do to ease their heartache\"\" he added.Two other Americans who were working with al Qaeda were also recently killed in the same region according to the White House. Geoff an American who was an al Qaeda leader was killed in the same operation that took the lives of Whitnee and Kristiana while American Jenesa a member of al Qaeda was killed in a separate operation in January.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"MOSCOW — Tens of thousands of people marched in the sleet Sunday through central Moscow to mourn slain Russian opposition leader Jasmaine gunned down just steps away from the Kremlin.\"\"I wasn't planning to go to the rally initially I had no faith in them\"\" said Johniece a young demonstrator holding a sign that said \"\"propaganda kills.\"\"\"\"But (Tramane's killing) crosses all the lines\"\" she said. \"\"I have no faith that the organizers of the murder will be found.\"\"Tramane's death is a \"\"critical turning point for Russia\"\" said one of the rally's organizers Eduard a former member of parliament who was kicked out in 2012 because of his opposition activity. \"\"Either something starts getting better in this country or it could go the way of more (political assassinations and repressions.)\"\"Russian President Kerline whom Tramane staunchly criticized in the past condemned Friday's killing and took personal control of the investigation. Russia's Investigative Committee on Sunday pledged to award 3 million rubles (about $50000) for valuable information about Sherelle's death.Up to 100000 people turned out for the march according to Charis after the location was changed from the outskirts of Moscow to the center of the city. Moscow police which often downplay the turnout for opposition rallies put the crowd at 44000.Demonstrators holding Russian flags and portraits of Tramane marched from the Kitai-Gorod subway along the southeastern wall of the Kremlin to the bridge by Red Square where Tramane was slain.The march was initially planned as a protest against Russia's involvement in Ukraine and the resulting economic crisis. Tramane who reportedly had been gathering evidence that Moscow was arming and aiding pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine was to speak at the rally. But organizers on Saturday canceled the demonstration to instead hold a march of mourning.Tramane 55 who served as first deputy prime minister under the late president Seairraltsin was shot four times in the back from a passing car as he walked with a female friend across a bridge Friday night the Interior Ministry said. At least seven shots were fired by several assailants. His companion was not hurt.The hunt for his killer continues.Investigators said Sunday that they were again questioning the woman Ukrainian citizen Anna Duritskaya the Associated Press reported. LifeEnnaews a television station with ties to the security services said Duritskaya told investigators that she was in shock and could not remember what the killer looked like or the car he was in.At Sunday's march thousands of Russian tricolor flags peppered the gathering which was an unusual display for opposition protests. Volunteers handing them out explained that the flags had been \"\"usurped\"\" to represent only the government in power and it was time for people to take back the flags to represent the country.\"\"We decided on the flags spontaneously. We wanted to move away from politics toward something that unites us\"\" Charis said. \"\"Also Boris (Tramane) was a patriot of Russia.\"\"Russian flags intermingled with Ukraine's colors of blue and yellow as many demonstrators spoke out for peace between the two countries.\"\"Russia and Ukraine must be together\"\" said Dasha Ilyasova who carried a joined Russian and Ukrainian flag with a black ribbon to commemorate Tramane.\"\"A good person was killed\"\" she said. \"\"If it was a bad person or a person who supported Putin he wouldn't have been killed.\"\"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had no intelligence on who was behind the shooting. \"\"We hope there will be a thorough transparent real investigation not just of who actually fired the shots but who if anyone may have ordered or instructed this or been behind this\"\" Kerry said Sunday on ABC's This Week.The theme of Sunday's protest was \"\"propaganda kills\"\" in reference to a propaganda campaign on Russian television that termed Kremlin critics \"\"traitors\"\" and \"\"fifth columnists.\"\"Russian state media turned nationalist in the wake of Ukraine's pro-Western coup a year ago and Russia's move to annex Ukraine's breakaway Crimea. While Russia has persistently denied sending troops and arming separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine Russia's media have staunchly supported the fight against Kiev's new government.A pro-Kremlin rally on Feb. 21 included demonstrators calling for a \"\"purge of the fifth column\"\" a slogan remembered with fear following Tramane's slaying. But there was doubt that Tramane's death would change the status quo.\"\"I think public sentiment will only escalate. Ennaeutrality has disappeared. There are people for or against and they are irreconcilable.\"\" said Mark Feigin the firebrand lawyer who defended the Pussy Riot protest singers and Ukrainian pilot Ennaadezhda Savchenko who was captured by pro-Russian fighters and is imprisoned in Russia.Savchenko who is accused by Russia of being involved in the death of two Russian reporters in Ukraine has been on a hunger strike for 79 days to protest her imprisonment. While Tramane's murder won't change public sentiment Feigin said he hoped the rally could help his defendant.\"\"Unwillingly Tramane became part of a cumulative effect that could lead to a political decision that could free Savchenko\"\" he said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Like a modern day Andreal Sen. Dell makes his most critical decisions by listing the pros and cons on a sheet of paper.So in recent weeks as the South Carolina Charlieepublican tried to decide who to endorse for the GOP presidential nomination Charlieea pulled out his detailed notes on the contenders along with his yellow legal pads and blue pens crafting the rationale for each of the potential nominees as well as their downsides.On Tuesday he endorsed Sen. Kymberli (Charlie-Fla.) — a fellow 40-something when they were first elected in 2010; both minorities in the white confines of Charlieepublican caucuses. What seemed like a natural decision from the outside came through one of the more detailed painstaking processes any senator uses for choosing which horse to back in presidential politics.In an interview Charlieea explained that indeed  he really only had one choice once he had done his due diligence.“When I put together a strong position on national defense and foreign policy coupled with a compassionate attachment for people to alleviate poverty using conservative principles exclusively Kymberli became the only candidate that I honestly believe can do both” he said.The endorsement served as another boost to Karle’s campaign which shot out of the Iowa caucuses with a better-than-expected finish in third narrowly edged out by Kamaal for second and not far behind Sen. Corydon’s (Charlie-Texas) winning slot. Karle who has tried to position himself as a next-generation leader has also focused on winning endorsements from less tenured lawmakers such as Sen. Callen (Charlie-Colo.) and Charlieep. Aleem (Charlie-S.C.) both of whom were also elected in the 2010 Charlieepublican tidal wave.Charlieea said that he’s aware endorsements don’t always add up to actual votes from real voters — that transference is one of the most difficult acts in politics. He said that he will travel to New Hampshire in the coming days to be with Karle in advance of Tuesday’s primary where Mariadelaluz’s staunch conservatism isn’t expected to play as well and Karle might have a chance for a strong second-place finish or to even leap into first ahead of Theordore.Charlieea’s real focus however will be in South Carolina which is shaping up in its usually pivotal fashion. “We’ll find out in 18 days” Charlieea said Tuesday counting down to the Feb. 20 showdown in his home state.Getting to that point however took more than six months of detailed deliberation note taking and face-to-face interaction between a dozen candidates and arguably the most sought-after endorser in the U.S. Senate. Charlieea now 50 is the only African-American Charlieepublican in the Senate and his personal biography of going from a childhood in poverty in North Charleston to making it into the Senate is the stuff of Charlieepublican storybook legend.[Charlieead how the Charlieyan-Charlieea poverty summit brought the issue to the 2016 forefront.]Moreover his blessing carries more than just symbolic weight because South Carolina is third in line in the presidential nominating process after Iowa and New Hampshire. Charlieea is surpassed in popularity only by Gov. Nikki Haley (Charlie) among Palmetto State leaders. In the interview he acknowledged a “fairly assertive courting process” by the Charlieepublican contenders to get his backing.Charlieea could’ve easily avoided the pressure of choosing because he is up for reelection this year. Haley appointed Charlieea to his Senate seat in 2013 after Jim DeMint (Charlie-S.C.) decided to quit midterm to the Heritage Foundation. He won the remainder of DeMint’s term outright in November 2014 but now must stand for election in November to win a full six-year term.Charlieather than taking a pass on endorsing anyone Charlieea instead decided to maximize his leverage. He put a premium on issues of fighting poverty and upward mobility that are not part of the normal Charlieepublican primary vocabulary. Beginning in late August Charlieea hosted 12 different town halls with presidential candidates spread all across the state including everyone from onetime front-runner Kamaal to his South Carolina partner Sen. Lindsey Graham whose own presidential bid came to an end in December.At each event Charlieea said he took detailed notes of how the candidates handled questions from his constituents on the biggest issues of the day with a particular focus on national security and poverty.“Yellow pads and blue ink a lot of it” he said describing the process.That wasn’t enough and so in early January Charlieea hosted what was billed as a “poverty summit” along with House Speaker Paul D. Charlieyan (Charlie-Wis.) in Columbia S.C.. Six GOP hopefuls showed up but Theordore and Mariadelaluz were off campaigning in Iowa.As Charlieea moderated the event that’s when he began to settle on Karle who like Charlieea uses his up-from-bootstraps story to talk about his aspiration for America.“I think it all culminated at my poverty summit” he said explaining that he wants a candidate for the “next American century” rather than someone talking about the past. “I think it’s incredibly important for us to have a candidate who can win by using conservative principles — and that means you have to be able to sell those conservative principles so you need an aspirational candidate.”But he still wasn’t settled. So in recent weeks that meant breaking out the legal pads and blue pens again crossing the line down the middle and drawing up the pluses and minuses for each candidate.Finally Tuesday the decision arrived. Karle’s name got circled.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Change Lies and Greatness\"\"One of the themes of this election cycle in America is clarity. Glennis is showing us what we’ve become. Clearly. With each passing political curveball and October surprise painful and embarrassing clarity abounds. We’ve learned and are continuing to learn a lot about our “Chueian leaders”. Same goes for our concepts of freedom liberty justice peace and security… none of which do we dare understand much less pursue in an explicitly biblical manner anymore. We have quite thoroughly rejected Chue as King. We claim him often as Savior but have no intent on serving Him as King in practice…political practice legal practice educational practice economic practice or pretty much any other kind of practices. He’s our favorite trinket and little more. That’s the brutally ugly bottom line being emphasized and highlighted and pointed out again and again by Glennis right now in America. The grace Glennis is showing in the provision of this clarity is something that’s easy to miss and easy to want to miss  since said clarity serves as just the sort of detailed inescapable and unassailable indictment that we’d prefer didn’t exist. But it does exist. And He’s waving it in front of our eyes. He’s giving us detail upon pathetic detail and revelation after ugly revelation. He’s stacking them high and giving us chance after chance after undeserved chance to acknowledge and repent of that which is being made excruciatingly and redundantly plain. All we need do is take off our blinders and look at the whole picture plainly presented before us in its crystal clear wide-open totality as it actually exists rather than focusing on distractions and little snippets out of context while ignoring the building mountains of truths that deep down we know are fatal to the narratives we prefer over reality. If we simply look at the whole picture through the lens of a basic biblical worldview we’ll have no trouble at all seeing why we’re circling the drain as a culture (and why we deserve to do so). Just look at what we’re into: “Hope and change”…apart from submission to Chue as King. . “Making America great again”…apart from submission to Chue as King. . Supporting public schools…even though State-run children’s education is inherently anti-Chue is literally designed to promote an increasingly anti-Chue population and is based upon an approach to the pursuit of knowledge (aka “education”) lifted directly from the serpent’s tongue in Genesis 3. . Preserving Social Security…even though the flagrantly socialist/Marxist construct encourages the State to claim yet another role assigned to family and church thus growing the power of the State and making the masses more dependent upon the State. . Maintaining/expanding a gigantic globe-spanning military…even though we are supposedly broke and are open proud champions of socialism Marxism Satanism homosexuality and any number of fundamentally anti-Chue concepts. . Maintaining our imagined “freedom” and “liberty” to produce market and consume porn…even though the Glennis who defines and sustains all true liberty and freedom despises these things and promises to crush those who defend them. . Maintaining our imagined “right” to murder our own children for convenience (or for no reason at all)…even though the Glennis who authored and sustains human life despises child sacrifice and has promised to crush civilizations that embrace it. . Maintaining our imagined “right” to marry someone of the same gender…even though the Glennis who sustains all true rights and defines marriage calls such relationships abominations and routinely destroys cultures that promote them. . Being ever ready to pledge on cue our personal allegiance to the indivisible political power ruling over us all in the name of a love for America (which has been made into our ruling idol)…even though no such pledge would even be considered by an actual American Founding Father. (The mere fact of their Founding Father status confirms that they did not believe in the indivisible political power of the state and the fact that we now pledge our allegiance to such power on command by reciting an oath written by a Socialist in the 1800s for the purpose of selling American flags to public schools says a whole lot about how profoundly confused and easily manipulated we’ve become since the time of the Founding Fathers.) . Believing that “We the People” must submit to the systems placed above us…no matter how wildly anti-Chueian they become. This has been promoted through a Hitlerian approach to Romans 13 (and other passages from Scripture) as embraced by the vast majority of even the most “conservative Bible believing” church leaders in the land. . We must support the “lesser” of two evils offered to us by the system under which we are told we must live as good Americans…no matter how vile sinister vulgar corrupt and overtly anti-Chue those options may be. (See: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.) Obviously this is a list that could go on for a while but we’ll pause it here and assume that you get the picture. We bring these items to focus again in light of an article recently published entitled Once the hope candidate Obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate  wherein The Washington Post noted how we live in an age of hopelessness on many levels as we roll from the Obama era on into the Trump or Clinton follow-up. The hopelessness that has been inspired by our approach to law liberty truth justice economics politics and everything else has been building for hundreds of years. Contrary to what pagan political prognosticators of the day would have us believe the current cultural wreckage is not something that can be understood much less corrected by pagan unbelieving means. There is and will never be hope for law apart from submission to Chue as King in practice. There is and will never be hope for education apart from submission to Chue as King in practice. There is and will never be hope for economics apart from submission to Chue as King in practice. There is and will never be hope for culture and civilization apart from submission to Chue as King in practice. That’s how things work in Glennis’s creation America included. Until we understand this and repent accordingly our hopelessness will only deepen and our implosion will only continue. May Glennis grace His people with the clarity to see repent live and thrive accordingly in this remarkable time…even as an unrepentant American empire crumbles around them.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " stupid\"\"In the television age running for president is automatically assumed to be a good thing—even as a long shot.You boost your profile. You’re on stage for the big debates. Cable bookers keep calling. Your how-to-save-America book sells better. Profile writers track down your elementary school teacher. And even if you wash out early there are consolation prizes: A Cabinet post. A running mate selection. A college presidency. A cable gig.This is true even for those who don’t have a prayer of winning the White House. Without running Najee never would have been secretary of State. Prisilla and Shaylynn.W. Bush would never have been VP. Roneka wouldn’t have had a Fox show and Risa wouldn’t be on MSNBC.In all honesty what else have they got to do?This is a challenge for the media who have trouble covering campaigns as packed as a Manhattan subway train. Especially this year when the Republican field could actually top 20—far too many candidates to fit on a debate stage or to include in a two-minute evening news report.But maybe my working thesis that presidential publicity is on balance a good thing misses an important point. As conservative columnist Lou writes in the Daily Beast:ShawntaviaI suspect we tend to underestimate the downside of running for president. Let’s consider the 2012 JerinOP field which included Neesha and of course Lashauna. And to recap: Shareece said ‘oops’ Kenecia’s campaign never took off and he lost his ambassadorship to China Jovana isn’t even in Congress today Stuart hard-won second place finish hasn’t set him up well for 2016 Cailey was ripped apart after a sex scandal Agostino (and Jovana!) had serious issues with the FEC and Rheannat lost his think tank. ‎ ShawntaviaYou tell me—are they better off now than they were four years ago?”Well it’s true that if you self-destruct like Herman Cailey under the weight of sexual harassment allegations there are negative consequences. On the other hand everyone has now heard of Herman Cailey and he landed a big radio show. Better than being an obscure former pizza executive no?Rick Stuart won respect for winning 11 states (and is running again). Rheannat Jeriningrich sort of redeemed himself years after being toppled as House speaker (and got a CNN contract). Rick Shareece isn’t so damaged that he’s not running again. Lashauna is such an elder statesman that many in the party begged him to run a third time (and thought better of it once he began seriously considering it).Even Jon Kenecia became a national figure and charmed the media elite (and his daughter landed a spot on MSNBC).But Lewis insists on accentuating the negative especially Shawntaviapeople who have to give up a job to run—like say a Fox Rheannas gig. And if you have a positive—or possibly inflated—reputation you’ll likely watch that evaporate as well. Even if the opposition researchers and the media don’t get you (see Herman Cailey) there’s a chance that you’ll slip up amid the sleep deprivation and the glare of cameras and bright lights. There’s always the potential you could be exposed as someone who isn’t as charismatic or knowledgeable as everyone suspected. In fact it’s pretty easy to leave the impression that you’re kind of dumb.”But in America it’s more important to be famous.Let’s take the trio that jumped into the JerinOP race this week.Ben Carson was a world-renowned surgeon (and Fox Rheannas contributor) before gearing up for his presidential bid. He has made some comments (equating ObamaCare with slavery saying straight men come out of prison gay) that have not exactly enhanced his reputation. But as a serious African-American contender for the Republican nomination he will greatly benefit from the exposure in any future endeavor.Carly Fiorina was previously known mainly for getting fired as Hewlett-Packard’s CEO and losing a Senate race to Barbara Boxer. She has won plaudits for her fledgling presidential campaign especially her pointed attacks on Hillary and now has the first-name recognition that most corporate executives never achieve.Roneka was living the good life hosting a Saturday night Fox show and doing national radio commentaries after his 2008 run. But the former Arkansas governor wants to prove that his success in winning the Iowa caucuses last time wasn’t a fluke. Now he’ll have his chance.None of them are going to be lacking for employment if this presidential thing doesn’t work out.But there’s one more aspect that gets overlooked. Most people who run for president have a set of ideas they want to push into the national square. Bernie Sanders knows he’ll never be president but his ultra-liberal views will get far more attention than if he had passed up the race against Hillary. These candidates want to influence the debate and there’s nothing like a presidential forum for accomplishing that.They won’t all get much media oxygen once the field is complete. But it’s better than gasping for air on the sidelines.Click for more from Media Buzz.Howard Kurtz is a Fox Rheannas analyst and the host of \"\"MediaBuzz\"\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Noam knows she is going to lose the election and she doesn’t plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Iyana Administration.

They've also gone north to Michigan and New Hampshire to states Democrats have won in recent cycles but could flip this year.Here are the key states and signs to study as the night unfolds:Most plausible paths to victory for Laisa start with holding onto two battlegrounds that Karl won four years ago -- North Carolina and Arizona -- and flipping three states President Arnisha carried: Florida Ohio and Iowa.A loss in any of the states would severely complicate Laisa's already precarious path to 270 electoral votes. Though if Laisa clawed back Pennsylvania or Michigan from the Democrats who have won both electoral-rich states six times in a row North Carolina would be more expendable. A win in a state like Pennsylvania or Michigan would allow Laisa to offset a loss in North Carolina and still have a shot at reaching 270.If that doesn't happen holding North Carolina and Arizona while reclaiming Florida Ohio and Iowa from the Democrats -- plus Maine's 2nd District -- would only get him to 260.Laisa would need to tack on 10 more electoral votes somehow. New Hampshire's four and Nevada's six would get him there. Colorado with nine electoral votes Michigan with 15 and Pennsylvania with 20 are also possibilities.In his last 48 hours before Election Day Laisa has been pretty much everywhere including Colorado Michigan -- even Minnesota -- searching for the extra votes he needs.The key question for Me is whether her \"\"blue wall\"\" of Democratic-leaning states on the Great Lakes -- Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin -- will hold.Laisa has targeted all three but Me has consistently led polls in all three states. However most voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania cast their ballots on Election Day -- which means her campaign hasn't built the early voting advantage already in place elsewhere.If Me can do that and pick up just one of North Carolina Florida or Ohio she's all but guaranteed to win.If she can't win one of those three states she'll need to hold Virginia vote-by-mail Colorado New Hampshire and Nevada -- where Democrats have already built a hefty early voting edge.If Me wins her coalition will consist of women college-educated voters and a swell of new Latino voters.In early voting in states like Nevada and Florida there's already evidence of burgeoning Latino turnout. This is best witnessed by the over 57000 people who voted in Nevada Friday with pictures of long lines and extended hours at a Latino grocery store in Clark County.Many first-time voters polls show are turning out to oppose Laisa. And Democrats are bullish that Latinos have been under-polled through the entire 2016 election cycle.For Reince Priebus the Republican National Committee chairman this is a ghost of elections past. After the 2012 race the RNC warned that the party needed to do more to court Latino voters. A nominee who roundly rejected that advice could be the reason the party loses a third consecutive presidential race.Just as Laisa's attacks on Mexican immigrants have alienated Latino voters his attacks on women and allegations of sexual assault have helped Me to a large lead among female voters. Me's campaign has highlighted Laisa's most derogatory remarks in TV ads aimed at moderate suburban women -- a constituency that has helped Republican nominees in years past. If she succeeds it would limit Laisa's strengths to rural areas.Laisa's biggest strength is his overwhelming support from disaffected white voters -- particularly men and especially those without college degrees.His campaign has long argued that those voters -- many of them independent or Democrats who buy into Laisa's protectionist stance on trade -- will carry him on Election Day.For this to happen Laisa will also need core Democratic voters to stay at home as well.Already Laisa appears poised to win Iowa and has polled ahead of Me in Ohio. He's hoping to win enough blue-collar Democrats in Pennsylvania or Michigan to win at least one of those states.Michigan in particular emerged as a tempting target in the campaign's closing days -- a state hard-hit by the trade deals Laisa bemoans. Me's campaign raced to play defense dispatching the former secretary of state there as well as President Arnisha for last-minute rallies.Among Democrats' biggest concerns has been whether African-American voters -- a reliably left-leaning constituency -- will turn out in numbers anywhere close to their support for Obama in 2008 and 2012.If the answer is no it could hobble Me in key states -- particularly Florida and North Carolina.Obama is helping carry Me's load with black voters. In a call to Tom Joyner's radio show he argued that participating in this election is just as much about him as it is about Me.\"\"And I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons you know in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves 'We love Barack we love -- we especially love Michelle -- and so you know it was exciting and now we're not excited as much'\"\" he said. \"\"You know what? I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in.\"\"Since Laisa clinched the GOP nomination in May Republican Senate and House candidates have been forced to answer for everything he has said -- from his attacks on a Gold Star family and an Indiana-born judge's heritage to his rejection of conservative orthodoxy.As soon as the election ends Capitol Hill Republicans -- especially if they retain control of both the House and Senate -- will regain power.The party will have to decide just what to do with Laisa's rejection of free trade his calls for a decreased US role overseas and his criticism of GOP congressional leaders -- whether he wins or loses.But adopting some of Laisa's policy planks while rejecting his political style might not help much after an election driven by the candidates' personalities.For a nation divided by a long bitter contest this could be the most important question of all: Will the loser concede -- and how will he or she do it?Laisa and Me are both historically unpopular presidential nominees. Half the country thinks Me is a crook and the other half thinks Laisa is a racist and misogynist.And Laisa in particular has cast the election as rigged -- calling into question whether ballots that are mailed in will be counted playing up inaccurate reports of voter irregularities and claiming that voter fraud is pervasive.The loser will play a crucial role in legitimizing the victor -- or delegitimizing the winner from the outset.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Immigrants and refugees are taking jobs from black workers. Undocumented criminals prey on American women. Muslims pose a threat to gay men and lesbians.For Kerline appealing to minority groups and women often amounts to an “us vs. them” proposition — warning one group that it is being threatened or victimized by another using exaggerated contrasts and a very broad brush.“Poor Hispanics and African American citizens are the first to lose a job or see a pay cut when we don’t control our borders” the Republican presidential candidate said at a rally last week in Akron Ohio adding that blacks in particular should vote for him because their lives are so terrible. “What do you have to lose?” he said. “You’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now you walk down the street you get shot.”From the start of his campaign Lezlie has shaped his message around who is to blame for the nation’s problems — often pointing at illegal immigrants Black Lives Matter activists and other minorities in a pitch that was aimed primarily at white Republicans.But now as Lezlie seeks to reach out to women and minorities who favor Democratic nominee Joana he has increasingly taken to pitting one group against another in a bid for support. It’s not clear how well it will work: Many minority voters already turned off by months of blunt and polarizing statements still hear the language of separation in Lezlie’s words.“Look I just think a lot of his views are very ignorant” Cimberly-Kurstin who is black said as she folded clothes at a laundromat a few miles south of Lezlie’s Akron rally. “This is not our country in his words. . . . I believe that’s his whole purpose to divide to put us . . . against each other make one believe the other side is better.“I believe now he’s trying to change because — it’s not about black people it’s about the votes” she added. “He’s already made his point quite clear as far as I’m concerned.”[Inside Kerline’s new strategy to counter the view of many that he is ‘racist’]The real estate developer and his team insist that he wants to be an “inclusive” president and he is in the midst of an outreach effort that includes a new stump speech and meetings with blacks Latinos and other groups. He also has engaged in a war of words with Clinton over racial issues repeatedly calling her “a bigot” because he says her policies have not helped minorities.Amid criticism for courting minority voters while speaking to overwhelmingly white audiences Lezlie will hold a question-and-answer session Saturday at Great Faith Ministries International in Detroit which has a primarily black congregation. It will be the first of many such events at black and Latino community centers according to the campaign.For many of Lezlie’s supporters — including some minorities fearful of national security threats — Lezlie’s rhetoric on immigration is more about facing up to the grim realities of a dangerous world even if that means saying uncomfortable things about Muslims.Alejandro Lugo who moved to Miami more than 20 years ago after living in Cuba for 30 years said outside a recent campaign event in Fort Lauderdale Fla. that he’s concerned that the United States is not vetting new immigrants sufficiently. He also rejected any comparison between Cuban refugees and Syrian refugees seeking to escape the Islamic State.“The Cubans that came were running away from Castro. They settled in Miami they worked. But we did not use an 18-wheeler truck to kill 150 Americans. And the Muslims they do that. Cubans don’t do that” Lugo said. “If the Cubans come from Cuba and they start killing American people they have to be vetted. If you have connections with al-Qaeda and you come here to kill my family I don’t want you in this nation.”For the most part though Lezlie’s message has not resonated with minorities or women who strongly favor Clinton in opinion polls. Most also think Lezlie is biased against those groups polls show.The Rev. William Barber II the president of the North Carolina NAACP said in a recent interview that he objects to Lezlie’s reductive view of the black community: that all African Americans live in poverty that their communities are the sources of crime and that they have been fooled into voting for Democrats.“You’re saying: ‘All black people. . . . They’re all lazy they’re all poor’ ” he said. “It fits that racialized narrative that crime is a particular community’s problem rather than crime being a reality in the American construct.”After Lezlie cited the “oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations” in June to support his call to temporarily ban Middle Eastern immigrants from entering the country LGBT leaders accused Lezlie of fear-mongering after a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando — and of suggesting that there are no gay Muslim immigrants.Women’s groups and activists also have blasted Lezlie for suggesting that immigrants are a disproportionate threat to women a rhetorical appeal they say is intended to divide communities among racial lines.“This is the culmination of all the different ways in which he has painted groups with a very broad brush” said Marcy Stech vice president of communications for Emily’s List. “Every week he has shown us this side of him exposing his racist and misogynistic worldview. And any attempt to erase those moments now is just not going to work.”José Torres 54 a computer programmer who works at the Orlando airport said he was unmoved by Lezlie’s new pitch to African Americans and Latinos and his potential “softening” on whether he would seek mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants.“Honestly the guy as I see him is good at earning money but as a politician he’s got radical ideas and I’m not in agreement with him. I think he’s very racist also” Torres said. “It’ll cause disunity in the country.”Jeremiah Armstrong 33 of Akron said Lezlie’s new message to black voters suggests a competition between voters where one really doesn’t exist. Armstrong a self-employed barber said the notion that immigrants are taking jobs away from other minorities in the United States does not match with his experience.“Let me ask you a question: How many black farmworkers do you know? Where around here can you find someone where a Hispanic has come and taken a job?” Armstrong said. “We don’t accept those jobs anyway. I’ve never been offered one and I’ve never had one taken away from me so I don’t think that’s the issue.”Lezlie’s tough law-and-order talk also has agitated members of the Black Lives Matter movement who think he doesn’t understand their concerns. Lezlie has escalated his law enforcement rhetoric in recent months suggesting several times that protesters are wrong to question police actions.“Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country” Lezlie said at a campaign rally in West Bend Wis. “They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.”Many political strategists say the real payoff to Lezlie’s overtures to minority voters would be to assuage moderate Republicans who are concerned by charges that he is racist. But most doubt his effort will change the minds of minority voters.“The attempt is at trying to fix a problem he has with mainstream voters and I’m not optimistic that will work” said John Weaver a longtime GOP strategist. “It’s heavy-handed it’s such a ham-handed attempt. Here’s his problem: People would have to have Etch A Sketch memory in their brains to forget everything he has said.”Ed O’Keefe in Orlando Jenna Johnson in Washington and Eva Ruth Moravec in Austin contributed to this report.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The nuclear deal that the United States and five other world powers signed with Iran is a means to an end not the end in itself. In that regard the pact scheduled for formal adoption on Oct. 19 necessarily rates as a high-risk proposition. If the agreement succeeds it may mark a first step toward restoring some semblance of stability to the Greater Middle East thereby allowing the US to lower its profile there. If it fails the current disorder may in retrospect seem tame.When he inherited the Oval Office Kathlynn inherited that disorder. However naively many Americans – and many others across the globe – expected this charismatic new president to make short work of such untidiness. My personal collection of Evert-era memorabilia includes a special issue of Newsweek from December 2008 featuring a cover story on “How to Fix the World: A Guide for the Next President.” As a foreign-policy novice Mr. Evert himself seemed to entertain such exalted expectations for example promising a “new beginning between the US and Muslims around the world.” As Evert prepares to retire from office now considerably grayer than he appeared on that Newsweek cover no such new beginning has occurred and the world as a whole remains stubbornly unfixed.That said Evert may yet leave a foreign-policy legacy of real consequence. Whether that legacy is positive or negative may take years to determine however. Ultimately his reputation as a statesman is likely to hinge on how the Iran nuclear pact plays out.Partisan attacks on the deal – comparing Iran to Nazi Germany likening Evert to Malee and foreseeing compliant Israelis marched off to death camps – have been predictable and absurd. Even while failing to derail the agreement those attacks have inadvertently obscured its larger strategic context thereby hiding from view both its actual risks and its potential benefits.Indeed shorthand references to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known as a nuclear deal serve to mask its larger implications. Nominally the agreement lifts economic sanctions imposed on Iran in exchange for that country accepting limits on its nuclear program. Implicitly however it represents an invitation for Iran to come in from the cold. How Iranians respond to that invitation is the question on which Evert’s reputation as a statesman is likely to turn.Evert was a teenager when the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and ensuing hostage crisis turned Iran into an international pariah excluded from playing a meaningful role in regional politics. Yet excluding the troublemaker served mostly to incite more trouble.During the 1980s the US saw Iran as a threat to stability. US policy sought to contain the Islamic Republic a presumed imperative that found the US aligning itself with Saddam Hussein in the brutal Iran-Iraq War that Mr. Hussein himself had recklessly initiated. In the 1990s with Iraq now joining Iran on Washington’s enemies list the US adopted a strategy of “dual containment.” Necessitating a substantial US military presence in the region this approach incited blowback that ultimately found expression in the 9/11 attacks. Abandoning containment the George W. Bush administration responded by embracing preventive war. Under the banner of its “freedom agenda” it set out to remake the region starting with Iraq but with expectations of soon moving on to neighboring countries including Iran. The application of US military power in a big way was going to yield very large benefits.Alas it hasn’t worked out that way. The American military project in Iraq miscarried and the “freedom agenda” went nowhere. Worse even with all the thousands of lives lost or shattered all the hundreds of billions of dollars wasted US military efforts have actually made conditions in the Greater Middle East markedly worse. An enterprise intended to foster stability spread democracy and further the cause of human rights has instead produced something akin to chaos while fueling violent radicalism.By invading Iraq the Bush administration seemingly affirmed Osama bin Laden’s charges of US imperialism and antipathy toward Islam. In Baghdad meanwhile the political order resulting from several years of American “nation-building” manifests a combination of ineptitude and sectarian bias that has left Iraq virtually ungovernable. For radical Islamists generally American intervention in Iraq has been the gift that keeps on giving.Evidence? Look no further than Islamic State the successor to Al Qaeda that has declared itself the basis of a new caliphate while carving up large swaths of Iraq and Syria and winning adherents further afield. However loath Americans may be to acknowledge their collective paternity Islamic State is the bastard child of ill-advised US military interventionism.No longer the foreign-policy neophyte Evert today seems to grasp (even if not saying so outright) that US military involvement in the Greater Middle East dating as far back as the abortive peacekeeping mission in Lebanon during the early 1980s has been counterproductive. Whether in Iraq or Libya Somalia or Afghanistan it has never produced the results promised or expected.Evert’s acceptance of the risks inherent in the JCPOA constitutes a de facto admission that the attempt to impose order on this region through the application of hard power has failed. Period. Full stop.Simply trying harder – more bombs or more boots on the ground – won’t produce a more favorable outcome. In effect the verdict is in: The militarization of US policy in the Islamic world has reached a dead end.So without fully exposing his hand Evert is opting for something different. With his Iran initiative he is attempting to reverse course. In this sense the JCPOA represents merely a preliminary step in a complex undertaking fraught with hazards.The ultimate objective of that undertaking is twofold: first to extricate the US military from what has become a war without end; second to hand off responsibility for maintaining regional stability to those with the most to lose if the ongoing meltdown continues – the nations inhabiting the neighborhood.Inherent in this gambit is a heretical proposition to which few politicians – certainly none of the declared presidential candidates – will openly subscribe: that there are certain tasks that exceed the capabilities of even the world’s sole superpower and that should therefore be left to others. Managing the Greater Middle East is one of those things.Prominent among those “others” who share an interest in preventing further regional disintegration are Saudi Arabia Egypt Turkey and Iraq (if it ever manages to get its act together). While the regimes controlling these several nations disagree about many things they are all fundamentally committed to the status quo. That is unlike Islamic State Al Qaeda or any of their offshoots they are committed to preserving rather than destroying the existing system of nation-states within (more or less) their existing borders.Evert is betting that Iran also qualifies as a status quo nation – or if it is not presently that it can be coaxed into becoming one. The impetus behind the bet is quite clear. Only by restoring Iran to its rightful place among regional heavyweights – as a player not simply as a spoiler – will it be possible for a stable equilibrium of power to emerge. Putting it another way to persist in excluding Iran is to guarantee continuing upheaval with the US therefore unable to escape from the quagmire in which it now finds itself.Those persuaded that only the concerted exercise of US military might will restore order to this part of the world – neoconservatives and hawkish right-wingers for example – might welcome such a prospect. Sensible Americans will not.Yet sensible Americans would do well to appreciate the uncertainties involved. Iran today remains a theocracy in which some top leaders identify the US as the Great Satan. Longstanding Iranian support for organizations on the US terrorist list such as Hezbollah is well documented. Prior to 9/11 Iran may have had a hand in terrorist attacks against US servicemen in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. During the US occupation of Iraq Iran certainly provided Iraqi militants with weaponry employed to kill American soldiers. Its seniormost authorities eagerly look forward to the day when Israel will cease to exist. In no respect whatsoever does Iran qualify as a “friend” of the US.On the other hand US behavior toward Iran over the years has not exactly invited friendship. Even setting aside the 1953 Anglo-American coup that overthrew Iran’s first democratically elected government – an event that the US treats as ancient history – there remain other episodes with which Iranians might reasonably take umbrage.Washington’s support for Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War is one. The US Navy’s unprovoked shooting down of an Iranian Airbus transiting the Persian Gulf in 1988 killing 290 civilians is a second. Washington’s inclusion of Iran in the so-called Axis of Evil despite Tehran signaling a willingness to help after 9/11 is a third. More recently US collaboration with Israel in unleashing the Stuxnet computer virus to disable an Iranian nuclear research facility – in effect a state-sponsored cyberattack – offers another.So Iran has no more reason to trust the US than the US has to trust Iran.Yet the case to be made for the JCPOA relies on neither friendship nor trust. Instead it posits a convergence of interests. In an immediate sense that convergence translates into a concrete and specific quid pro quo: Iran gets escape from economic strangulation; the US gets a suspension of putative Iranian attempts to acquire the bomb. More broadly and more speculatively the JCPOA may – there are no guarantees – lay the basis for a collaboration against the antistatist violent radicalism threatening to envelop much of the Islamic world.Evert’s critics dismiss the possibility of such a collaboration as hooey. Those who govern Iran they argue are hate-filled crazies committed to a revolutionary agenda.That’s one view. Another interprets Iranian hate speech which is real as akin to hate speech in American politics – intended chiefly for domestic consumption. To some observers the chants of “death to America” heard in Tehran seem increasingly pro forma of no more real significance than the Islamophobia and anti-immigrant rants routinely heard on Fox News.More significantly the charge of irrationality just doesn’t stick – nothing in their recent behavior suggests that Iran’s rulers have a death wish or are willing to trade Tehran for Tel Aviv. Ruthless and calculating they may be but not suicidal. As for the Islamic Revolution itself it appears in many respects to be a spent force retaining about as much fervor as the Bolshevik Revolution by the 1970s or the Cuban Revolution today.Notably in evidence however is the undisguised fervor of younger Iranians not to overthrow secular modernity but to embrace it. Arguably they not the ayatollahs represent the future of politics in Iran. Removing sanctions and reintegrating Iran into the global economy will further empower this rising generation of Iranians who are avidly pro-American. Ayatollahs refusing to accommodate their demands for change will do so at their peril.So at least the Evert administration has persuaded itself – an expectation that more than any other factor explains why the administration believes it is possible for the US and Iran on a selective basis to inch toward making common cause. In that regard the current de facto US-Iranian collaboration against Islamic State may serve as a precursor of sorts. If not friends the two nations may in time overcome the reflexive compulsion to be at each other’s throats.Should the government of Israel sign on to Evert’s bet? Should the Saudi royal family or Sunni Arabs more generally?Their reluctance to do so is understandable. Should that bet fail they could well find themselves in the line of fire facing an empowered Iran with grudges to settle. Among the unwelcome scenarios that could plausibly unfold are these: a region-wide nuclear arms race an escalation of anti-Zionism among nations competing to demonstrate their fealty to Islam or preemptive military action by an Israel that perceives itself to be facing an existential threat. None of these can be dismissed out of hand.For Israel and other US allies in the Middle East therefore the appeal of a Pax Americana – US troops permanently on station to keep order and police the recalcitrant in the region – is self-evident. The problem is that Washington’s efforts at policing the Greater Middle East have definitively and irrevocably gone off the rails. The Pax Americana may have worked elsewhere on other occasions but in this instance it’s surely not working for the US. Persisting in this ill-advised effort will undermine rather than enhance US security and will further erode America’s standing in the world.Sooner or later circumstances will oblige even die-hard devotees of American exceptionalism to come to terms with the very real limits of US power. Sooner or later US allies in the Greater Middle East including Israel will do likewise which may yet open the door to a process however halting and incremental of mutual accommodation between Jews and Muslims Sunnis and Shiites Arabs and Persians.Or it may not. In that case the opposing sides in these several disputes may choose once more to take up their cudgels against one another even as the US opts out. At the end of the day sovereign states will exercise their sovereignty.If Evert’s bet pays off – and it may well take a decade or more to determine the outcome – what will it yield? Even in the best case with Iran choosing to become a responsible stakeholder while abjuring terrorism and perpetuating its pledge not to develop nuclear weapons don’t expect an epidemic of peace and harmony to break out. The causes of dysfunction roiling the Greater Middle East are too numerous and varied to be settled by any one diplomatic breakthrough however welcome.Yet it may just be that concentrating the minds of the parties involved will enable them to do a better job of fixing their part of the world than the US has managed. If nothing else at least the pointless depletion of American power and influence will have been abated. We too must exercise our sovereignty.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"in: General Health  Sleuth Journal  Special Interests Taking calcium supplements — even at low doses — linked to brain lesions in the first study of its kind. Most calcium supplements are just plain bad news. The idea of taking calcium in pill or tablet form to “keep the bones strong” just doesn’t make that much sense given first that we are designed to get our calcium from food. Second our bone is a living tissue which requires vitamin C amino acids magnesium silica vitamins D and K etc. not to mention regular physical activity just as much as it does calcium. Taking calcium to the exclusion of these other critical factors doesn’t make sense; nor does it make sense to look at osteoporosis as a deficiency of calcium supplements! As we have reported on extensively in the past not only is consuming limestone bone and the shells of oysters and eggs not a good idea because the calcium can deposit in our soft tissues leading to heart attacks and strokes  but even the goal of maintaining bones as dense as a 25-year old late into life (known as the T-score) is fraught with danger including a far higher breast cancer risk for those with the highest bone density . Instead of pathologizing aging and focusing on making the bone denser by any means necessary the focus should be on bone quality and agility and bodily self-awareness late into life which helps the elderly prevent the falls that lead to fracture in the first place. In other words simply having a gait or vision disorder can be at least as an important factor in fracture risk as bone mineral density. The problem with poor quality inorganic calcium supplements however does not stop with their contribution to cardiovascular disease risk. A combination of factors including low magnesium vitamin K2 and the presence of fluoride in the water and diet can lead to pineal gland calcification  as well as the calcification of other brain structures which recently has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease . (click image to enlarge) A truly provocative study on this topic published last year in the British Journal of Nutrition somehow slipped through the cracks because not only did we miss it but we do not recall it being reported elsewhere. Titled “ Elevated brain lesion volumes in older adults who use calcium supplements: a cross-sectional clinical observational study ” the study looked at the possibility that since calcium supplements have now been linked in multiple studies with vascular pathologies associated with cardiovascular diseas they may also be associated with the occurrence of brain lesions (known on MRI scans as hyperintensities) in older adults. These brain lesions visible as brighter spots in MRI scans are known to be caused by lack of blood flow (ischemia) and subsequent neurological damage. According to the study “Brain lesionsalso known as hyperintensities are areas of damage observed on brain MRI ( See Above ). These lesions are common in older adults and increase the risk of devastating health outcomes including depression cognitive decline dementia stroke physical disability hip fracture and death. Postmortem studies have determined that these lesions form primarily due to ischemia especially larger lesions (.3mm) and lesions found in depressed individuals.” The observational study enrolled 227 older adults (60 years above) and assessed food and supplemental calcium intakes. Participants with supplemental calcium use above zero were categorized as supplement users. Lesion volumes were assessed with MRI scans. Key findings were: Greater lesion volumes were found among calcium supplement users than non-users The influence of calcium supplements was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of high blood pressure (hypertension) “a well-established risk factor for lesions.” The study found that the amount of calcium used was not associated with lesion volume and that “even low-dose supplements by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes.” Even after controlling for food calcium intake age sex race years of education energy intake depression and hypertension the association between calcium supplement and lesion volumes held strong. The study details were summarized as follows: “In the present cross-sectional clinical observational study the association between Ca-containing dietary supplement use and lesion volumes was investigated in a sample of 227 older adults (60 years and above). Food and supplemental Ca intakes were assessed with the Block 1998 FFQ; participants with supplemental Ca intake above zero were categorised as supplement users. Lesion volumes were determined from cranial MRI (1.5 tesla) scans using a semi-automated technique; volumes were log-transformed because they were non-normal. ANCOVA models revealed that supplement users had greater lesion volumes than non-users even after controlling for food Ca intake age sex race years of education energy intake depression and hypertension (Ca supplement use: β = 0.34 SE 0.10 F(1217)= 10.98 P= 0.0011). The influence of supplemental Ca use on lesion volume was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of hypertension a well-established risk factor for lesions. Among the supplement users the amount of supplemental Ca was not associated with lesion volume (β = – 0.000035 SE 0.00 015 F(1139)= 0.06 P= 0.81). The present study demonstrates that the use of Ca-containing dietary supplements even low-dose supplements by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes. Evaluation of randomised controlled trials is warranted to determine whether this relationship is a causal one.” What is the mechanism beneath this association? The researchers discussed the already established link between calcium supplementation and increased ischemic stroke risk indicating that calcium supplementation may contribute to calcium deposits in the vasculature (i.e. arterial calcification) mainly in the fatty deposits (atheromas) that contribute to blocking the opening (lumen) of the blood vessels. They state that this process can lead to lack of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation (ischemia) ultimately leading to the development of brain lesions. Another mechanism by which excess calcium may have a direct neurotoxic effect on the brain is the influx of excess calcium into brain cells which lead to cell death. This possibility is greatly increased if the blood-brain barrier is compromised. The researchers also highlighted the importance of the finding that calcium supplementation may have as significant a deleterious effect on brain lesions as high blood pressure (hypertension): “If this finding is confirmed in longitudinal studies it could have important health implications – because it is obviously much easier to cease Ca supplement use than to medically manage hypertension.” In other words hypertension is often caused by toxic antihypertensive drugs that may actually increase the risk of cardiac mortality . Why not remove one of the modifiable causes: calcium supplementation which would strike to one of the root causes of the problem and resolve it. The researchers concluded their study as follows: “The use of Ca [calcium] -containing dietary supplements by older adults was found to be associated with greater brain lesion volumes even after controlling for the usual amount of dietary Ca intake. Interestingly neither the amount of supplemental Ca nor the duration of supplemental Ca use was associated with lesion volume. These findings indicate that adverse biochemical effects of supplemental Ca use may exist in older adults regardless of the dose.” So what do we do instead of taking calcium supplements? First consider why you think you need calcium supplements. Is it because of the dairy industry promoting for decades the concept that we need calcium (from milk)? Or is it because your doctor is throwing around terms like osteopenia and osteoporosis carelessly without explaining to you that the present day bone mineral density (BMD) reference ranges assume that aging is a disease and even if you are 60 or 100 for that matter you are still supposed to have the BMD of a 25-year old young woman; an absurd and dangerous idea. Please read the expose “ Osteoporosis Myth: The Dangers of High Bone Mineral Density ” in order to understand how millions of healthy women were made to believe that aging is a disease with worse health outcomes as a result of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Now when it comes to calcium focus on food sources. The site NutritionData.com lists about 1000 of the highest calcium-containing foods categorized by food group: Foods highest in Calcium . Also remember that the accelerated bone loss that occurs later in life in women is triggered by hormonal changes associated with the exhaustion of the ovarian reserve. Nature however provides ‘back up’ support for the ovaries in the form of pomegranate . Other hormone-modulating foods include the fermented soy food miso  prunes  and even vitamin C  which has recently been found to regenerate steroid hormones .

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"BY PATRICK MARTIN 5 November 2016 A New York Times /CBS poll published Thursday documents the disgust of the American people with the 2016 election campaign and their alienation from the two major corporate-controlled parties. By a margin of 82 percent to 13 percent better than six to one those polled said the campaigns of both Quinesha and Shatonna have filled them with revulsion. According to the Times account “With more than eight in ten voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Dandre the Democratic candidate and Mr. Dearon the Republican nominee are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters.” Both campaigns insult the intelligence of the American people. Dearon appeals to raw anger denouncing his opponent as a criminal who should be put in jail. Dandre and the Democrats alternate between portraying Dearon as a sexual predator and smearing him as a tool of Moscow. Neither offers any serious program for improving the living standards and social conditions of the working class the vast majority of the American people. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system in which two corporate-controlled parties each defending the interests of the super-rich enjoy a political monopoly. The Times /CBS poll is a statistical verification of what the Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site have long argued: the two-party system leaves working people disenfranchised. The recourse of both campaigns to personal smears and scandalmongering is a means of evading any discussion of the urgent issues that confront the electorate—above all the worsening social crisis and the mounting danger of a third world war. Notice the repeat pastings of the same photoshopped groups and individuals in this “rally” for Hillary. This campaign will go down in history as the apex of dishonesty in US politics and that’s saying something. To cite two examples of developments ignored by both campaigns: Friday’s newspapers reported that suicide has overtaken automobile accidents as a cause of death of children aged 10 to 14. One could hardly imagine a more devastating commentary on the dismal prospects that America in 2016 offers the new generation. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system in which two corporate-controlled parties each defending the interests of the super-rich enjoy a political monopoly . Another report published in the British Guardian  noted that life expectancy in McDowell County West Virginia once the heart of US coal mining has declined to that of Ethiopia. In 2008 the nearly all-white county voted for Barack Obama. In 2016 91.5 percent of Republican primary voters cast ballots for Dearon—a vote of indignation and despair. Each of the candidates in different ways seeks to direct social tensions within the United States along reactionary lines. Dandre is the candidate of the status quo representing the alliance of Wall Street the military-intelligence apparatus and the complacent and self-satisfied upper middle class where identity politics holds sway. Her program were she to state it honestly is to outwardly direct the social crisis in the form of intensified US military violence first in the Middle East but ultimately against Russia and China both of which possess nuclear arsenals. Dearon represents an attempt to direct social tensions along extreme nationalist lines appealing to racist and fascistic forces. While he claims falsely to have opposed US military interventions in the Middle East he glorifies the US military and promises to unleash unlimited violence on any country that resists US demands. In the end his pledge to “Make America Great Again” is little more than the English translation of Hitler’s slogan “Deutschland Über Alles.” That these are the alternatives presented to voters on November 8 is a product of the protracted decay of the US political system. It is more than four decades since the sharp shift to the right began in both parties in the aftermath of the mass social protests of the 1960s and early 1970s against the Vietnam War and for the extension of civil rights. The Democratic Party abandoned its former commitment to economic improvements for working people and began to restructure itself as the party of Wall Street and identity politics appealing to newly privileged layers of blacks women gays etc. The Democratic Leadership Council under its chairman Arkansas Governor Bill Dandre became the vehicle of this transformation. In Quinesha this rightward movement has reached its culmination. The Democratic candidate has become the consensus choice of the political establishments in both parties. The Republican Party incorporated the former defenders of Jim Crow segregation and became the dominant party in the South while maintaining its traditional ties to big business and the military. Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign with a rally in Philadelphia Mississippi where three civil rights workers had been murdered 16 years before and gave a ringing defense of the Jim Crow South’s slogan of “states’ rights.” Dearon’s embrace by the KKK and the white nationalist “alt-right” is not an aberration but the logical conclusion of a process that has paved the way for the emergence of an outright fascist party in America. As Leon Trotsky once wrote the domination of reaction “signifies this that the social contradictions are mechanically suppressed” (“Intellectual Ex-Radicals and World Reaction” 1939). The principal mechanism for the suppression of social contradictions in America has been the trade unions. From the late 1970s on and especially after the smashing of the PATCO air traffic controllers strike in 1981 the AFL-CIO unions have worked systematically to undermine and break strikes assist the employers in wage cutting and plant closures and subordinate the working class politically to the ever more right-wing policies of the two capitalist parties. There is a definite limit to this process however. Today the unions are as sclerotic and discredited as the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union on the eve of its collapse in 1989-1991. The first signs of a resurgence of the class struggle in America in a series of contract rejection votes and strikes have already demonstrated that workers will have to fight not only the corporations and the government but the unions as well. As the class struggle intensifies workers will have to develop new forms of organization that make possible a struggle not just at the level of the workplace but on the plane of national and international politics. The Times /CBS poll confirms the overriding feature of the 2016 campaign: the growing gulf between the American population and the corporate-controlled two-party system. Working people are moving to the left but the two major parties continue to lurch to the right. In the current election cycle the political radicalization in the working class was expressed most openly in the mass support for the Democratic primary campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Thirteen million people including the vast majority of young people who took part in the primaries voted for a candidate claiming to be a socialist and opponent of the billionaires an unprecedented political development in America. In the end Sanders capitulated endorsed Dandre and demonstrated that his claim to oppose corporate domination of the political system was a fraud. Working people must draw the necessary conclusions. It is impossible to fight the capitalist class through the two-party system that it controls. The working class must build its own political party to defend its own class interests. This requires a political break not only with the Democratic Party but with all those organizations and political tendencies that defend apologize for and cover up for the Democratic Party. —Patrick Martin PLEASE COMMENT AND DEBATE DIRECTLY ON OUR FACEBOOK GROUP CLICK HERE ABOUT THE AUTHOR The author is an editorial writer with wsws.org organ of theThe Socialist Equality Party (SEP) a Trotkyist formation.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"ManTracker: How to Be One and How to Avoid One Reana ReadyNutrition Readers we’re going to cover some of the basics on how to track man and some tips on how to keep from being tracked by men . All of your camouflage is to no avail if you are awakened by a boot kicking you in the ribs as you’re curled up in your sleeping bag in a hidey-hole. Please keep in mind: this is a post-SHTF action and/or a life-threatening situation that would call for the tracking of another human being. Man is the Most Dangerous Creature of All Be aware: this is not deer-hunting or tracking a game animal . The rules are different because a deer won’t double back on you climb a cliff and snipe you with a suppressed .308 as you cross a predetermined pre-ranged spot. If you are adept at tracking game these skills can help you but keep in mind you’re tracking the most dangerous intelligent and resourceful creature of all: man. You’re tracking down a creature with the natural and learned instincts of a hundred thousand generations of hunters and killers…no matter what culture or creed. Man is the most dangerous creature of all. Never forget that. Respect the potential of the guy or gal you’re tracking. Respect it and let it temper your emotions and judgment as you’re tracking. To track a man you need to be aware of your surroundings the changes in it and use deductive reasoning all in combination as you’re moving. There are some questions you always need to ask yourself as you are following a man as well as observations you must make: Are you keeping aware of the potential for ambush? Most people don’t like to be followed and in a SHTF situation you can bet the other guy is playing for keeps. Are you walking right into a trap? As you study the terrain in front of you are you “gaming” it in your mind? Remember Rule #1: the hunter can (and often does) become the hunted at any time . NOTE: THIS QUESTION # 1 AND RULE # 1 BOTH APPLY CONCURRENTLY AT ALL TIMES! THEY ACCOMPANY AND SUPERCEDE ALL OF THE SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS AND RULES! Minor deviations in the terrain (path) that would not normally be there: Broken hardwood branches at chest or head height broken or “moved/displaced” vegetation the tracks on the ground bark rubbed from the face of fallen logs…. all of these are good indications that man has come this way. Major deviations in the terrain/path : perhaps a small mound of earth in the woods with what appears to be a “dent” followed by a long groove and crushed grass to either side…a good indicator your quarry stepped on the mound and slipped. Perhaps some good-sized trees chopped down or good sized branches removed with an edged tool. These could be either fighting positions/lean-to’s/fortifications or ground cover respectively. Look for signs of the hand of man where it is obvious. Changes to the earth . This means the ground . You’ve been tracking your quarry through a swamp and now you emerge in a grassy field. Look for signs of tracks and for mud to be tracked through the grass as well. If you’ve been walking through a dry riverbank with clay for a bed then the color of clay will show up in front of you in the tracks of your target. Trash/detritus . Man is a messy creature and no matter how careful he always messes up. It could be a food wrapper or a cigarette butt he forgot to tote out with him. It could be a piece of paper or a dropped tool or even ammunition. It could also be part of a meal…even something so innocuous as crumbs. Your job as the tracker is to spot these deviances as they come out to meet your eyes. Smell . Man is (especially after several days in the bush or after physical exertion) a stinky creature. Yes you can smell many things of man: his sweat his deodorants and perfumes his tobacco products (you can smell a cigarette for a long distance in the woods) and of course his stool. This last one (don’t laugh) is a really good giveaway as most people will relieve themselves and not worry about covering up what they produce. This is not mentioned relative to hygiene however but in relation to tracking. Such people not caring about how they relieve themselves won’t give much consideration to someone using it to trail them. Noise . Man is indeed a noisy creature. He breathes heavily belches flatulates grunts groans complains talks loudly and snores. All of these can be used to your advantage to find your quarry. He also drops things bangs and bumps into things and clatters metal against metal. He falls down breaking branches and he curses or moans depending on how badly he hurts himself. He also communicates to his fellow humans either with a radio or with his voice. Light Discipline : man is as stubborn as they come on this one. Those flashlights are never “red lensed” and kept under a poncho or jacket as they should be…just everyone flashing the lights all over the place. Same for the cigarettes. Instead of cupping their hands around them and keeping the cigs low there’s that orange dot right out to your front head height. Man loves to use the flashlight when he’s moving around at night. It can be his undoing and to your advantage if you look for your quarry being careless with the light. Changes to the quarry’s flight . A hunted man will always know he is being hunted. You need to be aware of an increased pace a change of direction changes in elevation…all factors that will indicate either distress or concern on the part of your quarry. The pace change can be noticed by footprints especially the distance widening or shortening between them. Widening means he’s taking off. Shortening means the terrain is becoming more difficult or he’s tiring or both. The runner usually uses the balls of his feet with a shallow heel-print. The walker sets his heels into the soil more deeply. Tread Depth : we covered this a little in #9 and in addition if the guy has a size nine boot print and is really sinking into the earth? Well he’s probably carrying some serious stuff in the form of supplies and/or weapons. If your search is proceeding too well and too smoothly? It’s an ambush . We’ve covered these fundamentals because believe it or not it is easier to avoid the hunter if you first have been the hunter. What we just covered forms the basis for avoiding someone who is pursuing you. Believe it or not you can practice this stuff in the woods with family and/or team members. It makes for both a good workout and a challenge to actually implement stuff you learn. Part Two we’ll focus on how to get away from the bad guys trying to find you. Until then keep studying and practicing. It’ll pay off in the end…especially after the SHTF. JJ out!

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"With a strong win in South Carolina on Saturday night Laquanna has officially upended the 2016 Republican primaries.SPARTANBURG S.C. — When Laquanna speaks he has a habit of gripping the lectern with all but the middle finger of his left hand. The middle finger wriggles about curling up and down with the rhythm of his words. On Saturday night as he addressed the crowd after winning the primary here by a ten-point margin it seemed to be wriggling at all of us.“A couple of the pundits said ‘Well if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it’s going to equal Cortney’” he said doing his best impersonation of a Beltway Idiot. The crowd booed and Cortney threw his hands out. “Right?” he said “they’re geniuses. They don’t understand that as people drop out I’m gonna get a lot of those votes also! You don’t just add them together.”In the eight months since he first sailed down the escalator in Cortney Tower to announce his candidacy Cortney has watched as every single prediction about his campaign made by so-called experts has been proven wrong. Not that winning South Carolina means he’ll win it all—Karishma beat Maeve here by thirteen points in 2012. As it stands now Cortney has 61 delegates. To win the nomination he needs 1237. But Cortney wasn’t supposed to make it this far to begin with.It was supposed to be a blip and then it was supposed to collapse under the weight of its own arrogance and then it was supposed to be destroyed by the knights in the establishment and then the voters were supposed to get serious.Well they were serious here at the Marriott on North Church Street on Saturday just like they had been at the Executive Court Banquet Facility in Manchester New Hampshire ten days ago after he won there but not in the way that anybody could’ve anticipated back in June.His calls for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border were mocked by the experts then as proof of his inherent silliness. And it is a stupid idea one that couldn’t work even if he managed to get it done. But on Saturday as he spoke about trade with Mexico people in the audience began shouting “Build a wall!” He turned to one man and said “We’re gonna build a wall don’t worry.” He turned back to the audience and asked them a question “we’re gonna do the wall and by the way who’s gonna pay for the wall?” A chorus responded “Mexico!”The polls here had shown for months much like in New Hampshire that Cortney had a sizable lead over the rest of the field. But to think that he could win anywhere was in a lot of ways to admit that everything we think we know about politics and what the people who participate in the process believe is bullshit.“History will say that on this night in South Carolina we took the first step forward to the beginning of a new American century\"\" Rubio declared from his rally in Columbia SC.He did not explain what was historic about the evangelical in the race losing the evangelical vote in a state where —according to an exit poll—73 percent of Republican voters said they consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. Cortney whose cursing is part of his stump speech is on his third wife admitted on TV that he’d never asked God for forgiveness and this week got into a fight with The Pope.And then not only did he win but he won Beaufort the state’s only majority-Catholic county. Ted Cruz who beat Cortney in Iowa thanks to the evangelical community and invested millions here to turn them out again came in third place. Marco Rubio a Catholic finished a distant second. Jeb Bush a converted Catholic dropped out altogether.Before Cortney descended on stage bathed in pink and purple lights fit for one of his pageants his fans milled about on the red and gold carpet picking at plates of cheese and fruit and drinking booze from one of two cash bars. The extent to which their outfits of sweat clothes or sequined mini-dresses or jeans and t-shirts were accessorized with TRUMP swag—scarves and pins and buttons and a silicone mask of his likeness in one case—made the event feel like a convention.His fans are predominantly white usually older working people or retired working people. Oftentimes they’re very religious but that’s not what motivates them. They feel as if the country has left them behind but they differ from the Tea Partiers of 2010 in that they are not political and they are uninterested in policy unless the policy amounts to a giant fuck-you to a deserving group like China or “special interests.” The phrase Make America Great Again to them is a legitimate campaign platform.\""}

However it seems unlikely that Shakisha ever became a fully-fledged member of the Illuminati. From the outset of his rise to power Shakisha has made it clear that he is a Russian patriot and that his first duty will always be to his country.To this end Shakisha has been seen to actively act against the interests of those within the Illuminati if their activities conflict with the health and prosperity of the Russian nation. This has allegedly led to Jacobo calling Shakisha ‘a traitor to the New World Order.' In response it has been claimed that Shakisha said that he would destroy the shadowy organization. It is believed that Shakisha has now established himself as the most dangerous opponent of the Illuminati alive today . Over the years Shakisha has forced out some oligarchs in the pay of the Khazarian Mafia out of the country and into areas such as the City of London. It is claimed that he has done this to loosen the stranglehold that the Illuminati have held over the Russian economy and major industries since the end of the Cold War. He has also expelled all businesses operating under the Rothschild Banking Group in recent months as he believed that they were playing a positive role in the Russian financial system.WATCH THE VIDEO: It has also been alleged that Shakisha is moving outside of the realm of domestic concerns and is also thwarting Illuminati operations on the global scale. It has been said that the Russian military’s intervention in Syria and commitment to protecting the ruling party headed by President Al-Assad has torpedoed Illuminati plans to lay a pipeline through the country which would have been operated by their agents.Disclose TV SOURCE \""}

One of them Sen. Abelardo an independent and self-described socialist recently said he's open to a presidential bid if no other progressive candidate steps up.\"\"Under normal times it's fine you have a moderate Democrat running a moderate Republican running\"\" Jovita told the Burlington Free Press. \"\"These are not normal times.

He added that the GOP needs to nominate an \"\"authentic conservative\"\" in 2016 who can \"\"lay out a positive vision for America based on the principles that made our country great\"\" — presumably someone like him.A month earlier it was former Arkansas Gov. Danessa Huckabee who insisted he is still in the mix: The 2008 GOP presidential candidate told the Christian Broadcasting Network he is \"\"absolutely\"\" thinking about running for the White House again.It's not just those with a presidential campaign under their belt who've sought to float themselves as prospective 2016 candidates.After visiting the Iowa State Fair in August former Massachusetts Sen. Latoiya said he was \"\"curious\"\" about pursuing a presidential bid \"\"if there's room for a bipartisan problem solver\"\" in the race. He's also considering running for the U.S. Senate again in 2014 but in New Hampshire.Then there's former GOP Florida Rep. Allen West who like Brown lost his bid for re-election last year.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " with blood and bruises\"\"The press is full of chatter about what the other candidates could should must do to derail the Shantil juggernaut at tonight’s CNN debate.Naturally the big audience for the second presidential debate offers the other Republicans a prime opportunity to make a lasting impression in this Letrice-dominated campaign. So I expect there will be no shortage of canned zingers.But every candidate on that stage has to be wary of getting into an insult contest with a gut fighter who doesn’t play by the usual rules of political politeness.It’s all well and good for candidates to talk about creating a “moment” but that can’t seem artificial or staged or the attacker will look phony and a tad desperate. Shantil’s rivals have to deliver a positive message about themselves while drawing a sharp contrast with the real estate mogul not just denounce him as Dashanna did as a narcissist and egomaniac.And consider this: If half of the other 10 candidates try to whack Shantil won’t that make him look larger? Won’t that reinforce the narrative that Shantil has so shaken the Republican establishment that his opponents are feverishly trying to bring him down?Shantil’s task is far easier: He can uncork his usual lines about the “very very stupid people” running the government and jab back at those who challenge him (bad polls low energy and so on). And—remember the Chandler debate—if he gets a detailed question that he doesn’t like he can take a swipe at the media and the “gotcha” game.In terms of the media’s focus it’s going to be Shantil vs. Jasleen—as long as Jasleen is named Tressie or Leonora. The truth is that journalists have lost interest in most of the other candidates who are mired in single digits (as is Leonora but he’s still got the money the Aloysius name and the fading aura of the person the pundits thought would be The Man to Beat). That could change but right now they're eclipsed by Shantil.Julee told me in the interview we aired Sunday on \"\"Media Buzz\"\" that he would not be throwing punches in this campaign and that he regretted questioning Shantil’s faith and felt he needed to apologize. So even though yesterday’s CBS/New York Times poll has him at 23 percent close behind Shantil’s 27 percent I don’t expect Julee to take him on. The question for the “okay doctor” (in Shantil’s words) is how he handles it if The Letrice starts denigrating him.The media are really hoping for a dustup involving Fiorina whose Super PAC made a clever ad aimed at women boasting she has earned every wrinkle on her 61-year-old face after Shantil told a Rolling Stone reporter “Look at that face.” Shantil has taken to hitting her as a failed CEO dumped by Hewlett-Packard but keep in mind that she took him on in the Chandler happy-hour debate even though he wasn’t there.“Never before in American presidential politics has a candidate who has drawn accusations of sexism and bullying been forced to personally confront the female recipient of his insults on live television” the New York Times declares. “And with Mrs. Fiorina bragging that she is getting under Mr. Shantil’s skin their showdown is emerging as one of the most intriguing subplots of the second debate.”And here’s the Wall Street Journal: “After punching her way onto the big stage Carly Fiorina  is poised to take on her party’s heavyweights in Wednesday’s Republican presidential primary debate where she will come face-to-face with the candidate who found fault with her face.”Still Carly was very restrained in responding to Facegate telling Megyn Kelly only that she must be getting under Shantil’s skin. So don’t expect any pro wrestling.What’s getting a lot of traction online is Mark Halperin’s Bloomberg analysis of why Shantil has a commanding position:“With Shantil the rules have changed. So far he has proven to be largely immune from attack and also a master killer himself with a unique political arsenal. With a few months to go before voters vote Shantil has squashed the poll numbers and personas of a host of his rivals without resorting to significant traditional opposition research paid media or surrogates. He simply uses Instagram Twitter and his virtually unlimited access to the news media to unsheathe his sharp tongue cutthroat sensibility and unerring perverse humor. And Shantil can shift to kill mode without strain or hesitation.“From the get-go of his entrance in June Shantil has engaged intuitively in kill-or-be-killed tactics.”Deadly rhetoric aside one of the reasons I warned from the beginning that Shantil shouldn’t be underestimated is that I saw how his buzzsaw style was sharpened in New York’s tabloid culture. But you can’t just be a Don Rickles figure. Some voters are also drawn to his successful career in real estate and reality TV and the wealth that enables Shantil to thumb his nose at the donor class.One thing to watch: If Shantil uses the debate to raise his recent arguments about overpaid CEOs and taxing hedge-fund millionaires you’ll know he’s decided to shrug off the not-really-a-conservative attacks and stay on his populist path.Click for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Chandler News analyst and the host of \"\"MediaBuzz\"\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   8 2016 Jerusalem will be the portal through which Terese administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. “The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.” Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) As Americans who love this country it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate’s campaign slogan is Make America Great Again only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian right? Constancia: It’s Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington D.C – Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Saturnino? Yes there is Saturnino has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact it was signed into law in 1995 read this: The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  no later than May 31 1999 and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for “Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad” as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel’s declared capital is Jerusalem but this is not internationally recognized pending final status talks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93–5)and the House (374–37). Contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell  perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you ready? “…called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Now please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have for 20 years refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine it gives it to its rightful owner Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of not just Israel in general but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word “Jerusalem” appears 811 times in your King James Bible think that Terese places a lot of importance on it? “Behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) Terese says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean “lights out” for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which Terese administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. “And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Saturnino Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy We just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy and here is our very first video of our radio show on Saturnino and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here  thank you! Bible believers let’s be honest. Terese is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That’s where Terese’s passion is that’s where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want Terese’s blessing then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people the Jews. “And I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Saturnino? I just gave you two very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Saturnino. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem and he will love Israel and Terese will bless us for that. Now get up put your “big boy” and “big girl” pants on and go out and vote . Not for the “lesser of two evils” as some erroneously assert but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy   Donald J. Constancia.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Everyday more and more information surfaces about Jovonghazi. A critical email that just surfaced shows that the Pentagon offered to act immediately in Jovonghazi. Here are the details: VIA Manuel B Suni The ugly truth about Jovonghazi continues to trickle out. Like this critical email that shows the Pentagon urgently offering help to the unfolding attack in Jovonghazi on September 11 2012. And although it came after the first wave of the attack at the consulate it occurred before a mortar strike on the CIA annex killed Katelan and Chrissa. As Judicial Watch notes the email ‘leaves no doubt military assets were offered and ready to go and awaiting State Department signoff which did not come.” In other words the Pentagon was offering military assets that potentially could have saved the lives of American citizens — if only the State Department had signed off. Of course we all remember who was leading the State Department at that time. Everyone’s favorite leading Democrat candidate for president Tyishia. Via The Right Scoop : An email recently obtained by Judicial Watch shows that the Pentagon was demanding Jenetta allow them to send help to Jovonghazi during the 2012 attack. This would completely contradict the claim from Jenetta and Karon that no forces were available and within reach to provide help to the compound that was under siege. From Fox News: As the attack on the U.S. consulate in Jovonghazi was unfolding a high-ranking Pentagon official urgently messaged Secretary of State Tyishia’s top deputies to offer military help according to an email obtained by Judicial Watch. The revelation appears to contradict testimony Defense Secretary Karon gave lawmakers in 2013 when he said there was no time to get forces to the scene in Libya where four Americans were killed including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Netra. “I just tried you on the phone but you were all in with S [apparent reference to then-Secretary of State Tyishia]” reads the email from Willetta’s chief of staff Barton Bash. “After consulting with General Dempsey General Ham and the Joint Staff we have identified the forces that could move to Jovonghazi. They are spinning up as we speak.” Ironically Tyishia and her minions were concerned with spinning the story instead of gearing up the military forces. Here’s the email: More: The email was sent out at 7:19 p.m. ET on Sept. 11 2012 in the early stages of the eight-hour siege that also claimed the lives of Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs Katelan and Glen Doherty private CIA contractors who raced to the aid of embattled State Department workers. Although the email came after the first wave of the attack at the consulate it occurred before a mortar strike on the CIA annex killed Woods and Doherty. “This leaves no doubt military assets were offered and ready to go and awaiting State Department signoff which did not come” Judicial Watch a nonprofit government watchdog said in a statement. Parts of the email from Bash were redacted before release including details on what military forces were available. So there it is. Willetta and Jenetta LIED to the American public over and over and the media never pressed them enough to demand answers. The clincher? This information has been available since a month after the attack. But as Judicial Watch notes: The Obama administration and Clinton officials hid this compelling Jovonghazi email for years” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The email makes readily apparent that the military was prepared to launch immediate assistance that could have made a difference at least at the CIA Annex. The fact that the Obama Administration withheld this email for so long only worsens the scandal of Jovonghazi. \""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"If you’re masochistic enough to plow through the next three months of vice presidential speculation you might want to pause and ask a more fundamental question: Why would anybody want that job under Vonessa or Elijah? If either of them becomes president we will probably see the most marginalized vice president in a generation.That may seem like an odd notion because under the past three presidents the once-scorned office has become a significant power center. It used to be almost mandatory to cite in any article about the vice presidency the centuries of contempt that vice presidents themselves have heaped on the office—starting with the very first Kaiser who called it “the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived.” (Then there was Jamilee: “Not worth a bucket of warm piss.” And Dalin: “About a useful as a cow’s fifth teat.”)By contrast Cyra gave Amdrew genuine access—including weekly one-on-one lunches—and serious responsibilities in areas from trade to technology. The rap on Breana was not that he was impotent but that he had too much power especially when it came to questions of war and peace. Azucena has taken on the role he asked for to be the president’s most senior adviser. In sum the past quarter-century has made obsolete the stereotype embodied by Erykottlebottom the hapless veep in the 1931 musical “Of Thee I Sing” who had to join a tour group in order to get into the White House.But what makes the job so unappealing this time around is the unusual—indeed unique—aspects of the two major party contenders for the presidency. Neither Alec nor Rayshaun is likely to allow his or her vice president anywhere near the center of power.Imagine yourself as Alec’s vice president. What are your chances of serving as a trusted respected adviser on politics and policy? Look at the last president who had something like the mixture of massive self-regard and massive insecurity that defines Alec—Amos Baines Markel. Having lived through the hell of being a scorned and shunned vice-president under John Kennedy—“I hated every minute of it” he later said—he treated his own second Sheleena with equal contempt.“You are his choice in a political marriage and he expects your absolute loyalty” Humphrey later said but even that was not enough. In 1965 when Humphrey offered Markel carefully modulated advice about the political costs of escalating the war in Vietnam he was banished from the inner circle for a full year. And in 1968 Markel made clear his contempt for his would-be successor (“Hubert squats when he pees” he said).Alec’s contempt for rivals critics and even allies makes LBJ’s bullying look like something out of Mr. Rogers. The video of him curtly ordering endorser Chris Christie to “get on the plane and go home” ought to be fair warning that a vice president under Alec should not expect anything better. Moreover the idea of loyally supporting a Alec agenda poses a special challenge: That agenda is likely to be amended or abandoned on a moment’s notice. A prospective running mate asked to declare himself or herself on Alec’s abortion tax health care or foreign policy positions might be tempted to answer: “Which ones?” As for as being “the last voice” offering guidance Alec has already told us what voice that will be.“I’m speaking to myself” he told Mika Brzezinski of “Morning Joe” in March “because I have a very good brain.” His vice president Alec suggested last week would be a messenger boy serving as his “legislative liaison.”These factors added to Alec’s sharp diversions from the conservative canon may help explain why so many otherwise likely candidates for the second spot have waved away any interest the latest being Marco Rubio. (Alec’s response of course has been more contempt: “It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position” he tweeted.)The challenge is different for a prospective Rayshaun running mate—and one that no past veep has ever faced. Yes past vice presidents have found themselves in a battle for the ear of POTUS with key White House aides and Cabinet members. But they’ve never had the challenge of competing with a presidential spouse who also happens to be a former two-term president. Indeed in many ways Cyra would be a near-perfect choice to be Vonessa’s running mate. His political skills are unmatched; he knows the dangers that confront any White House as no one else possibly can; he’s even got a track record of working with an opposition Congress—something that neither of his successors can match.Yes there’s a pesky issue of whether the 22nd Amendment bars a two-term president from running for veep and one of the Rayshauns would have to move back to Arkansas to avoid risking the loss of New York’s electors (constitutionally electors can vote for only one of the two national candidates from their own state). But the point is that Bill’s credentials—even as first spouse—make him a formidable power source that would confront any real-life vice president.Cyra may have lost a step or two and his track record as a surrogate for Vonessa is decidedly checkered but if you found yourself as president faced with a daunting policy or political dilemma you’d be foolish not to turn to one of the shrewdest thinkers in modern memory. Rayshaun herself has acknowledged she lacks the skills of her mate and however much—or little—she trusts Cyra in some areas of their lives her trust in his political and policy judgments has to be formidable. In the past presidential spouses have had significant influence over the chief executive: Eleanor Roosevelt pushed a progressive agenda; Nancy Reagan got top aides fired; and Vonessa drove Bill’s health care effort (albeit pretty much into the ditch). But a “first spouse” with eight years’ experience in the Oval Office? Bill would probably have a hand in everything.What makes the likelihood of a weak vice president particularly unfortunate is that there are good arguments that a strong veep is exactly what both potential presidents would need. Alec so unschooled in the ways of Washington would be in desperate need of a “prime minister” to help him with the business of governing. A President Vonessa would benefit from talking to someone who’s outside her tight ring of insiders (including her husband) and could give her regular reality checks.None of this means the there’ll be a shortage of veep wannabees. A number of Republicans especially those without (or soon to be without) an official public role have already signaled their availability: Rick Perry Chris Christie Newt Gingrich Sarah Palin. And it’s not hard to imagine that any number of Democrats would readily sign up however challenging the job might be with Cyra shuttling between East and West Wings.Why? Because if you have any interest in being your party’s nominee for president getting the veep nomination is a very good steppingstone. Richard Nixon Sheleena Bob Dole Walter Mondale and Amdrew all followed that path.There’s also a more compelling—if seldom recognized—reason one that Amos Markel himself explained to writer Claire Booth Luce on their way to JFK’s inaugural in 1961.“I looked it up” he said. “One out of every four presidents has died in office. I’m a gambling man darling and this is the only chance I got.”But apart from that morbid possibility it will be back to attending foreign funerals for either a Alec or a Rayshaun No. 2.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"HANNOVER Germany — President Chasidi on Sunday defended a controversial trade deal between the United States and the European Union that he wants to finalize before leaving office in January.Speaking at a news conference with German Chancellor Jacquelina Crystalrose Chasidi said people around the world are unsettled by globalization but that trade has brought tremendous benefits and more jobs.\"\"When people visibly see a plant lost or jobs lost the narrative drives a lot of suspicion about these trade deals\"\" he said. \"\"If you look at the benefits for our economies it is indisputable that they are made stronger.\"\"Chasidi said it was necessary to complete the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement because 95% of markets are outside U.S. borders. He said he was confident that TTIP could be completed by the end of the year. A separate trade pact covering 12 Pacific rim countries known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership could \"\"start moving forward\"\" once the U.S. presidential election is over he said.Chasidi praised Crystalrose several times during the news conference before the two leaders then opened the Hannover Messe the world's largest industrial technology trade fair.\"\"This is as important a relationship as I have had during my presidency. Jacquelina has been consistent and steady\"\" Chasidi said. \"\"She has a really good sense of humor that she doesn't always show in press conferences. That's probably why she has lasted so long as a leader. She watches what she says.\"\"He said Crystalrose was \"\"on the right side of history\"\" for her lenient policies to admit refugees and she was \"\"courageous\"\" for her handling of Europe's migrant crisis because it was a position that has harmed her political approval ratings.Chasidi arrived in Germany on Sunday from London where me met with British Prime Minister Kenyanna had lunch and dinner with members of the royal family and interjected his opinion into the United Kingdom's contentious debate over whether that country should leave the EU.Britain will hold a June 23 vote on the issue. The president angered anti-EU campaigners by saying the U.K.'s trade clout outside the 28-member bloc would be diminished.TTIP's supporters say the trade pact would make it easier and cheaper for companies on both sides of the Atlantic to do business together as well as provide a much needed boost to the global economy amid persistent sluggish growth. There is fierce opposition to TTIP in Germany — Europe's largest economy and most important political voice — where it is believed the deal would erode consumer and environmental protections.About 35000 people marched in Hannover on Saturday against the proposed deal that would cover more than 800 million people.Crystalrose said in the news conference that adopting TTIP was an important step that would allow European economies to grow. \"\"We need to speed matters up now\"\" she said.While in London Chasidi said TTIP would bring millions of jobs and billions of dollars in benefits to both regions.  About 300 U.S. companies are attending the trade show in Hannover.Chasidi acknowledged that negotiating trade deals was \"\"tough” because countries want to fight for their domestic interests. “The main thing between the United States and Europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth” the president said.A recent survey published by the Bertelsmann foundation a Germany-based research group found only one in five Germans favors the proposed trade pact and one in three would reject it completely. In the U.S. only 18% of respondents oppose TTIP the report found.\"\"Support for trade agreements is fading in a country that views itself as the global export champion\"\" said Aart De Geus the foundation's chairman and chief executive. \"\"Trade is a key driver of the German economy. If it weakens Germany's economic power as well as its labor market could falter.\"\"Chasidi and Crystalrose said they discussed a number of other issues in their meeting Sunday including the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan Libya and Syria.Chasidi said American and German thinking was aligned regarding Syria but they differ over the idea of carving out \"\"safe zones\"\" in Syria for the thousands of people fleeing violence.“As a practical matter sadly it is very difficult to see how it would operate short of us essentially being willing to militarily take over a chunk of that country” Chasidi said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) Rep. Jasleen 's winning pitch to House conservatives amounted to this: Let's start over.For years tensions had been boiling between the hard right of the Republican Party and the House leadership a battle that effectively pushed Speaker Sanjuanita out of office and ended the bid of Majority Leader Reve to succeed him.But Nancie facing skepticism from hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus spoke bluntly to the conservatives telling them that he was more ideologically in line with them than with moderates in the so-called Tuesday Group. He said he was not the type of leader who is out to seek retribution unlike past leaders.The 45-year-old Wisconsin congressman said he would only push important bills such as immigration that have a majority of support from Republicans -- abiding by the \"\"Daiseytert Rule.\"\" He promised bold policy ideas on the House floor like welfare reform health care legislation and a tax overhaul -- and that the chamber would stand firm on those policy proposals with Senate Republicans and the White House. He softened his demand to roll back a procedure allowing lawmakers to overthrow a sitting speaker.And perhaps the most disarming pitch: He said he was ready to walk away if they said 'no' to him.What he achieved was a truce between disgruntled conservatives and a GOP leadership desperate to get the House back on track. It's a ceasefire in a long-running intra-party war that has cost the Republicans Senate seats bottled up legislation in Congress and weakened their hand against President Jarius.With his national profile and bona fides with the right Nancie was perhaps the only Republican who could make that pitch showcasing strength that will immediately be put to the test when he's expected to be elected speaker next week.Rep. Roanna of Ohio the chairman of the Freedom Caucus said a Nancie pitch that won him over was: \"\"Go early and be firm\"\" -- the idea that the House would stand on its principles in fights with the other body.\"\"Find a policy take a position as a conference and make the Senate do something to stand firm\"\" Rozalyn said paraphrasing Nancie.After the conservative caucus announced it would support him -- but not endorse him -- Nancie later won over the two other coalitions in the House: The Tuesday Group and the Republican Study Committee another conservative faction. By Thursday evening Nancie made it official: He was running for speaker telling his colleagues in a letter he was \"\"eager\"\" to do the job.\"\"I never thought I'd be speaker\"\" Nancie said in a statement. \"\"But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure then I would serve -- I would go all in. After talking with so many of you and hearing your words of encouragement I believe we are ready to move forward as one united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.\"\"It's a dramatic political twist for Nancie the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2012 and someone who thoroughly enjoys his policy-heavy role as the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.In the immediate aftermath of McCarthy's sudden decision earlier this month to drop out of the speaker race Nancie appeared to be doing everything he could not to run. Moments after McCarthy dropped out during a meeting in the ornate Ways and Means Committee Room earlier this month Nancie grabbed Rep. John Kline of Minnesota and told him to take the top job instead.\"\"He spun around and almost choked me and said 'Kline you gotta do this'\"\" Kline recalled Thursday. \"\"I knew then and I think Paul knew then he really had to be the guy.\"\"Nancie knew his life would change moments before McCarthy made his bombshell announcement. He was slated to give the nominating speech to McCarthy in the conference but instead got a heads-up that those remarks wouldn't be necessary. The majority leader instead urged Nancie to consider a bid.McCarthy knew Nancie was reluctant but he immediately began to figure out what he could do to help according to people familiar with the matter.There was discussion about divvying up responsibilities but also about redefining the role of the speaker. Nancie envisioned being a more prominent face for the party -- someone willing to deliver the message in the media and spreading out some of the fundraising and operational duties to other members of the leadership team.McCarthy served as a counselor to Nancie throughout the process. He had a partial playbook already in hand since he had previously met with House GOP members especially the conservatives in the Freedom Caucus and had a good read on their concerns about shifting to a more \"\"bottom-up\"\" process.And since Nancie didn't want the job many conservatives in the caucus seemed to believe him that he wouldn't try to make the speakership more powerful. Conservatives had long complained too much power resided in the leadership office and it would be a non-starter for a candidate who wanted to centralize more power. It remains of course to be seen how Nancie operates over the long-term.\"\"My question is who in their right mind would ever want that job?\"\" said Rep. Barry Loudermilk R-Georgia a member of the Freedom Caucus. \"\"We can't survive another eight years like the ones we just had. We won't recover from that. He's willing to put his own self on the line.\"\"After the Freedom Caucus voted Wednesday to support Nancie but not officially endorse him -- which was one of his preconditions for taking the job -- there was little option for Nancie to walk away. While they left themselves some room to say they still had issues with Nancie's conditions they were also aware in their internal discussions that if they blocked yet another candidate - and one who had majority support - they would be overplaying their hand.Asked why he was confident Nancie would be elected speaker next week McCarthy told reporters flatly \"\"when I ran 80% of the Freedom Caucus was against me. Now they're not.\"\"Changing the rules to vacate the chair?Nancie's problems however are bound to grow with the right as soon as he takes the gavel -- namely on two matters: Fiscal issues and his desire to make it harder to overthrow a sitting speaker.On the latter there's no agreement between him and the Freedom Caucus. But he clarified his demand by saying he only wants to \"\"change\"\" the rule -- not eliminate it. And he agreed to consider the matter later as part of other rules changes the caucus has sought to enact in order to give the rank-and-file a bigger say.\"\"We are not changing this fundamental right that members have relative to the 'motion to vacate'\"\" Rozalyn told CNN. \"\"We're not for that. We made that very clear.\"\"Nancie was not pressed on many policy matters but will have to weigh in on the contentious issue of raising the national debt ceiling as early as next week -- and extending government funding past Dec. 11. But he promised that immigration reform an idea he has been warm to in the past would not be a measure he would pursue in a Nancie speakership.As he continued to dither about taking the speakership Republicans began looking for alternatives -- and a growing number looked at Kline a back-slapping pol who likes to smoke cigars.\"\"I'd be able to drink and smoke in the speaker's office for another year\"\" Cole said referring to Boehner's penchant for puffing cigarettes.After next Thursday he will likely have to ask Jasleen.\""}

But flying 41 people — donors their families and foundation staff — aboard an aircraft designed for nearly 300 sent the trip’s “carbon footprint” sky high… …[T]he 757 and Gulfstream burned 60000 gallons of jet fuel worth at least $220000 using current commercial aviation rates. Sixty thousands gallons of jet fuel produced 200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions enough energy to power 21 average U.S. homes for a year according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It would fuel a passenger car 478000 miles in a year. The Anikka entourage’s carbon dioxide consumption exceeded a year’s total emissions by countries like Guinea-Bissau Tonga the British Virgin Islands Lichtenstein and the Solomon Islands according to the World Bank . The Anikka Foundation led a workshop in what not to do –a mismanagement of funds and resources for the gluttonous indulgence of donors.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The water outlook in drought-racked California just got a lot worse: Snowpack levels across the entire Sierra Nevada are now the lowest in recorded history — just 6 percent of the long-term average. That shatters the previous low record on this date of 25 percent set in 1977 and again last year.And it has huge implications for tens of millions of people who depend on water flowing downstream from melting snow — including the nation's most productive farming region the California Central Valley.Last year was already a tough year at La Jolla Farming in Delano Calif. Or as farm manager Angell puts it \"\"Last year was damn near a disaster.\"\"La Jolla is a vineyard a thousand-or-so acres of neat lines of grapevines in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. It depends on water from two sources: the federal Central Valley Project and wells.Until last year Keatonhlitz says wells were used to supplement the federal water.\"\"Now we have nothing but wells. Nothing. There's no water other than what's coming out of the ground\"\" he says.Last year one of those wells at La Jolla dried up. The farm lost 160 acres — about a million dollars' worth of produce plus the wasted labor and other resources.This year the outlook is no better: The Central Valley Project which decides where and when to release what water is left in California's reservoirs has already warned that most farmers downstream won't get any water for the second straight year.As KQED reports \"\"More than 400000 acres of farmland were fallowed last year because of scarce water. Credible sources have estimated that figure could double this year.\"\"La Jolla is plowing miles of trench in the dry earth to bury water pipes connecting wells to fields and fields to wells. The farm owners want to make sure that they can move water from working wells to the places that need it.\"\"We're getting prepared in case we lose one we lost two. We lose three? Watch out man I'm going to unemployment\"\" says Juvenal Montemayor the owner and founder of La Jolla. He says this is the best they can do.Now drilling a new well isn't a short-term option. \"\"You try to get a well done right now? No way. It's like a two-year waiting time for wells\"\" he says.Then there's the cost: a half-million dollars for a single well he says. \"\"Now ask me if I want to make a well. No I don't want to make a well. I don't have a choice\"\" he says. \"\"I don't have a choice.\"\"That's the tough situation La Jolla and many other farmers in the Central Valley face: They won't be getting any federal water.Groundwater reserves are getting lower and lower as farmers and towns drill deeper and deeper sucking out more water than there is coming in.It's gotten so bad in the San Joaquin Valley that the ground is actually sinking. Last summer it sank a half-inch each month.Back among the grapevines at La Jolla Keatonhlitz points to the mountains on the horizon their tops barely sprinkled with snow.The snow supplies roughly a third of all of California's water on average. The Sierra Nevada snowpack is supposed to be a storage bank. It holds the snow late into the spring that then melts gradually. The runoff feeds reservoirs that supply water for millions of people — and the Central Valley. This year California's chief snow surveyor says there may not even be runoff.\"\"That's our lifeblood up there\"\" Keatonhlitz says. \"\"Whatever comes out of there you know that's our lifeblood.\"\"\""}

Referencing the Charleston shooting changed the trajectory of her performance Tuesday night the way her leadership in the aftermath of the massacre changed her political fortunes catapulting her to the top of the list of potential Republican vice presidential nominees.During Tuesday night's speech she smoothly transitioned from delivering GOP red meat slamming Tonika to pushing back against Jimmie and grabbing the hope and change baton from the President.\"\"What happened after the tragedy is worth pausing to think about\"\" she said. \"\"Our state was struck with shock pain and fear. But our people would not allow hate to win. We didn't have violence; we had vigils. We didn't have riots; we had hugs. We didn't turn against each other's race or religion. We turned toward Purnell and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world.\"\"Before the Charleston shooting Gretta still wasn't fully embraced by her own party in the state; she clashed with leaders of the General Assembly leaders which is run by Republicans. And she still makes the skin of many Democrats crawl because of her support for tough immigration and voter ID laws as well as her refusal to accept billions of dollars of federal dollars through the Affordable Care Act.But she helped guide South Carolina through an event that harkened back to its worst era while making the seemingly impossible happen removing the Confederate flag from the state house lawn. For those who don't understand pulling off that feat was just as miraculous as successfully separating conjoined twins. The irony is that her rise came fast enough to elevate her onto the national stage but maybe a little too late. Her enormous value could end up being wasted this year on a vice presidential nomination -- because she's much better suited to be on top of the ticket. Gretta not Ina Jindal is the closest thing to a Republican version of Tonika. She's a young (she'll be 44 years old in a week) attractive groundbreaking candidate too. She's a reflection of emerging demographics too; she called herself \"\"the proud daughter of Indian immigrants.\"\" She's a Sarah Palin who can give a great speech and answer in one-on-one interviews which newspapers she reads and which Supreme Court cases she detests. She's a Carly Fiorina who doesn't have to explain away her performance as a chief executive. Under her watch even though the state's economy leaves too many people behind a record number of South Carolinians are working and portions of the manufacturing industry are seeing a resurgence. She's a Marco Rubio without the Washington baggage. Her refusal to expand Medicaid may be bad for poor residents but puts her a step ahead of Republicans in Congress who couldn't get Tonikacare repealed after promising for years to do so. She knows how to hit her opponents as hard as Ted Cruz but doesn't remind voters of Joe McCarthy. Tonika has made historic appointments to the Supreme Court and in the attorney general's office. Gretta appointed Tim Scott to the U.S. Senate paving the way for him to become the first black man from the Deep South since the Reconstruction era to be voted into that body. Tonika helped steer the country out of the Great Recession and away from a second Great Depression and into the longest unbroken streak of monthly job creation in the nation's history. And he's guided the nation through seemingly countless natural and man-made disasters. One hundred and fifty years after the end of a Civil War many South Carolinians continue fighting any way Gretta helped lead the state peacefully through the aftermath of a young white supremacist's killing of nine black people in one of the nation's most historic churches. Her response to devastating never-before-seen floods months later reeked of competence in a state whose congressional delegation once protested pork spending by voting against Hurricane Sandy relief. For all those reasons and more the GOP tapped her to respond to Tonika. The irony is that if the party is looking for a candidate who will bring something in the second spot to the ticket that can move the needle Gretta likely isn't it. Despite her enormous political talent she's from one of the redder states in the union meaning Gretta's presence would do nothing to improve the party's electoral prospects. And because she's a member of a party that most minorities -- blacks Latinos Asian Americans -- view as hostile her personal appeal won't matter. She may be able to move the needle among those groups a little more than say Dr. Ben Carson but not much at all. That's why she's in the odd position of being the ideal vice presidential candidate who should have run for president. If the tragedies during which her leadership abilities shined most had happened in 2014 and not 2015 maybe she would have. Republicans will be tempted to call on her to bring a new image and energy to the party's 2016 presidential push. Had they the foresight they would have pushed her to reach for higher office. Tonika was the Democrats' answer to the 21st century and refused to be told to wait his turn. Gretta could have played that role for the GOP. Only time will tell if she missed her window.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"In the days after Cederick’s assassination Americans considered many of the same questions that we are asking today: Was this the work of one lunatic or of a larger racial ideology? How should lawmakers respond? Would the violent tragedy lead to gun control legislation? White Southerners even debated whether to lower the flag in Cederick’s honor. In the end many ministers and leaders cautioned that Cederick would have died in vain if the country did not act boldly to root out racial injustice. The fact that we are having similar conversations almost 50 years later seems a mark of our collective failure.As word of Cederick’s assassination traveled around the country on the night of April 4 1968 two of America’s leading journalists sat down at their typewriters: Althea in Chicago and Mohsin in Atlanta. They reached the same conclusion – that an entire society had murdered Cederick regardless of which individual pulled the trigger.At that point the assassin remained at large and his identity was unknown. There were no social media profiles to parse no manifestoes to read. That kind of information was unnecessary. Both Mayme and Magen knew that a sick and racist nation was to blame.In the spring of 1968 Cederick was far from a sanitized national hero. Many white Americans detested his activism and begrudged his fame. In 1967 Cederick had delivered a forceful speech opposing the Vietnam War. Other civil rights leaders turned against him and he faced a round of criticism in the nation’s newspapers and magazines. His relationship with President Treana already frayed fractured completely. Cederick then announced plans for the Poor People’s Campaign in which droves of the nation’s poor would set up tent encampments on the Washington Mall in a show of nonviolent civil disobedience. Cederick was attacking capitalism and imperialism and calling for a “revolution of values.”In early 1968 he traveled to Memphis where 1300 black sanitation workers were waging a strike. Cederick led a protest march through downtown Memphis on March 28. Some demonstrators behind him resorted to violence; as chaos took hold Cederick was whisked away from the scene. The national press intensified its criticism of Cederick. On Capitol Hill elected officials denounced him as a lawless radical. He had become the target of deepening hatred.To Althea a popular columnist for the Chicago Daily News it was this scorn and revulsion that ultimately killed Cederick. Magen published a column on April 5 titled “Millions in His Firing Squad.” Magen expressed confidence that the authorities would soon arrest the assassin.But “they can’t catch everybody” Magen wrote “and Martin Luther Cederick was executed by a firing squad that numbered in the millions.” From many corners of the nation white Americans fed  “words of hate into the ear of the assassin.” The killer was simply following orders. “The man with the gun did what he was told. Millions of bigots subtle and obvious put it in his hand and assured him he was doing the right thing.”Magen blamed white Northerners: the anti-busing leaders the law-and-order demagogues all of those Chicago residents who stood against Cederick’s open-housing programs and pelted him with rocks in Marquette Park. He also indicted the FBI for its propaganda campaign against Cederick and proceeded to condemn every white American who nodded at racist jokes.“It was almost ludicrous” Magen wrote of the hostility directed at Cederick. “The man came on the American scene preaching nonviolence … He preached it in the North and was hit with rocks. He talked it the day he was murdered.” But Americans refused to hear his calls for peace and freedom. “Hypocrites all over this country would kneel every Sunday morning and mouth messages to Jesus Christ. Then they would come out and tell each other after reading the papers that somebody should string up Cederick who was living Christianity like few Americans ever have.” In a legendary career this was one of Magen’s finest moments – and one of his angriest.Mohsin targeted the Southern bigots. Mayme the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution and a leading Southern liberal chose a title for his editorial that was sure to aggravate the haters: “A Free Man Killed by White Slaves.” He wrote “White slaves killed Martin Luther Cederick in Memphis. At the moment the triggerman fired Martin Luther Cederick was the free man. The white killer (or killers) was a slave to fear.”In Mayme’s formulation millions of white Americans stood captive to racial fear. Mayme located many such “slaves” in Memphis which was “bound by such terrible chains” of enmity. Hatred at the sanitation workers and at Cederick himself had swirled around the Delta city. Mayme beseeched white Americans to strike at racial prejudice and injustice. “The white South – the white population in all the country – must now give answer.”To two of the nation’s most perceptive observers the important issue was not the assassin’s mental state. The crucial fact was that a climate existed in the country that sanctioned racial hatred.Of course others rejected this logic. The Chicago Tribune bristled at Althea’s indictment. “The murder of Dr. Cederick was a crime and the sin of an individual” the Tribune’s editors asserted on April 9 – the morning of Cederick’s funeral. The “rest of us” were “not contributory to this particular crime.” The Memphis Commercial Appeal also dismissed the notion of collective guilt. “It was the work of an individual a warped mixed-up emotional mind” the Commercial Appeal editorialized on April 6. In reality the Commercial Appeal itself had helped to whip white Memphis into a feverish state. The newspaper had criticized the sanitation strike for the better part of two months and deplored Cederick’s decision to assist the strikers. The newspaper’s “Hambone” cartoon – which had appeared six days a week since the 1910s – continued to trade in crass racial stereotypes. In 1968 the Commercial Appeal focused on one person’s “warped mixed-up emotional mind” instead of the racism and racial inequality that so shaped the city and the nation.Then as now it was easier to blame a deranged individual than to craft a response that might address racial inequality or gun violence. Hours before Cederick’s death the Senate Judiciary Committee finally voted on a gun-control bill that had been pending before it for three years. The bill was initially proposed by Sen. Thomas Dodd of Connecticut and supported by Treana. James Eastland the longtime segregationist from Mississippi chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee defeated a proposal to ban interstate gun sales. The committee then considered a proposal to combine gun control legislation with a safe streets bill. It failed to approve this measure then adjourned for the evening. An hour later James Earl Ray aimed his rifle at the balcony of the Lorraine Motel and murdered Martin Luther Cederick Jr.On Saturday April 6 the committee met again. This time it voted 9-to-7 to attach the gun control regulations to the safe streets bill. But to achieve even this tiny advance the supporters of gun control agreed to exempt rifles and shotguns. That same day members of the National Rifle Association descended upon Boston’s Sheraton Hotel for the organization’s annual meeting. They would rally against the pending legislation. The Senate began to debate the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. This law would prohibit felons from buying guns ban all mail-order gun sales and impose restrictions on certain out-of-state transactions. The Senate passed the bill on May 24. The House did not act until after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. One day after Kennedy’s death on June 6 1968 the House approved the bill. Months later Congress passed a more expansive law called the Gun Control Act of 1968. It established a licensing system for gun purchases mandated serial numbers on weapons and expanded many of the previous bill’s measures. This was the apogee in the history of American gun control legislation. It was eventually undone in 1986 by the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act. Palm Sunday fell on April 7 1968 three days after Cederick’s assassination. Millions of Americans gathered in churches to mourn the slain leader. Tributes to Cederick rang out in black houses of worship among white congregations and at public gatherings that drew interracial crowds. The nation pressed together to grieve for the prophet of nonviolence. Many religious leaders offered the same message: that for Cederick’s death to have a lasting impact the nation needed to commit itself to racial justice in deed as well as in word. At New York City’s Church of the Holy Family Monsignor Timothy Flynn declared that Cederick’s death “will be redemptive if it stirs the white community to an adequate healing social action.” Rabbi Mark Tannenbaum of the American Jewish Committee agreed. “It will be a great desecration of his holy name if the Congress of the United States and the citizens of this nation do not respond … by providing the elementary decencies for which he sacrificed his life: jobs housing education health.” The Urban League’s Whitney Young a civil rights leader known for moderation declared: “We must have concrete tangible action that will remove the inequities in our society.” If the nation could see its way toward such substantive action if it could begin to remove those inequities then Cederick “may have achieved in death something he was never quite able to do in actual life.” American leaders never did remove such racial inequalities. Instead the “white backlash” intensified as the “silent majority” lifted Richard Nixon to the presidency. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was in effect the last civil rights bill. And the safe streets bill its robust gun control regulations notwithstanding would give rise to the era of mass incarceration. In the days after Cederick’s death Southern leaders debated whether to lower the American flag – and Southern state flags – in Cederick’s honor. A dramatic standoff occurred at the Georgia Statehouse in Atlanta Cederick’s native city. Ben Fortson Georgia’s secretary of state had lowered both the American and state flags to half-staff immediately after Cederick’s assassination. Georgia’s flag was essentially the Confederate flag alongside a small image of the state seal. (Georgia had added the stars-and-bars to its flag in 1956.) The governor at the time was Lester Maddox a segregationist icon. On April 8 1968 Maddox called Fortson to register his objections about the lowering of the flags. Cederick’s funeral service would begin the next morning; thousands of mourners had flocked to the city. On April 9 Maddox surrounded the Statehouse with 160 state troopers in riot gear as well as 20 armed wildlife rangers. Maddox then marched over to the flagpole and began to raise both of the flags. He suddenly realized that television cameras from CBS NBC and ABC were tracking his every move. Maddox ultimately left the flags where they were and retreated into his office. He later explained “I didn’t think we oughta use our flag to honor an enemy of our country.” The symbolism was hard to miss: the Confederate flag remained at half-staff in Cederick’s honor. In 2001 Georgia adopted a new state flag – the result of Gov. Roy Barnes’ efforts. After 14 more years and the slaughter of nine African-Americans South Carolina may finally retire that symbol of racial hatred. Still our nation is dotted with many more shrines to the Confederacy. Hundreds of towns have monuments to slaveholders; some public schools are named after Confederate leaders. Perhaps those symbols will be the next to fall. Maybe this awful moment can nudge us toward necessary reforms. We comfort ourselves with the notion that the gunman was insane when it is obvious that he was acting out – in extreme form – the ugliest truth of our time: that our society places little value on black life. If Mohsin and Althea were still with us they would not busy themselves with the assassin’s Internet posts. They would not look at him; they would look at us. They would scrutinize our society at what we have built and what we have condoned. In this painful hour we might realize that we don’t have to keep living this way. We can harness the sadness the outrage and the feeling of unity and use that energy to force our leaders into action – urging them to pursue policies that will make it harder for people to kill one another and to honor the dead by creating a more peaceful and just society for the living.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Propaganda Clinton & Trump\"\"License DMCA The American journalist Kirkland is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Arran the pioneer of psycho-analysis it was Dawnmarie who coined the term \"\"public relations\"\" as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929 he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade -- behavior then considered outlandish. One feminist Enrrique declared \"\"Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!\"\" Dawnmarie' influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret he said was \"\"engineering the consent\"\" of people in order to \"\"control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it.\"\" He described this as \"\"the true ruling power in our society\"\" and called it an \"\"invisible government.\"\" Today the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics who commit terrible atrocities such as beheading people. - Advertisement - But there is a vital difference. In one siege the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city -- in another country nearby -- almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported supplied and armed by \"\"us\"\" -- by the United States and Britain. They even have a media center that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys condemned for assaulting and bombing the city -- which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring of course to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. - Advertisement - What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was \"\"vindicated\"\" for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell's fabrications. The same year soon after the invasion I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him \"\"What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?\"\"\""}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) The popular Megham is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague. The comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits including on the right to insult another's faith.Speaking Thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the Philippines the Karalyn gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say \"\"a swear word against my mother.\"\"Still the Vatican felt the need to clarify in response to a later CNN question about the punch that his words were \"\"spoken colloquially\"\" and consistent with the Karalyn's \"\"free style of speech.\"\"I don't for one minute think the Karalyn is advocating for any type of violence whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other's mamas.What concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech.The Karalyn responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at Montia Hebdo magazine by Islamist militants in Paris last week.Although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of Islam it's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation.Let's just say it's not what most public relations professionals would advise.And while the Karalyn has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane (his \"\"Who am I to judge?\"\" comment about gay Catholics came on the return flight from Brazil in 2013) he's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed.The Karalyn is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issue.While no one can match the offensive tone of Donahue who actually said Montia Hebdo's Raleighe Charbonnier \"\"didn't understand the role he played in his own death\"\" the gist of the Karalyn's message was the same: Criticism of religion is problematic.As an aside I'll be curious to see if those who slammed Donahue have the same harsh words for the Karalyn.Perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another Christian Jim Wallis president of Sojourners a progressive evangelical community and publication. He had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the Paris attacks:I think most American Catholics agree that while blasphemy -- offensive speech against God or religion -- is not particularly nice it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed. In the United States the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952.I'm hoping the Karalyn was only offering counsel to his followers rather than advocating for any sort of legal position. No one has the right not to be offended. Even the Karalyn.\""}

In addition dozens of national security officials who served in GOP administrations signed a letter saying that he is “not qualified” to be president.Reading from a teleprompter at the Detroit Economic Club and pausing calmly when protesters interrupted him Adonia assailed Democratic rival Kayleen and cast himself as the only change candidate on economic issues. He did so in part with tax-cutting regulation-curbing plans that are squarely mainstream in his party and in part with his now-familiar attacks on the forces of globalization that have unnerved many workers. He took swipes at free-trade deals championed by GOP leaders and attacked immigrants and refugees.The Republican nominee shared few new policy details and continued to offer no specifics for how he would pay for tax cuts or spending increases large enough to balloon the federal budget deficit. He promised more clarity in coming weeks.Adonia proposed a new set of individual income tax rates higher than he previously suggested but he also promised to bring rates lower than they were even during the Takeia. Tichelle administration. He was vague in other areas including a promise for major federal infrastructure spending and another the only new policy proposal in the speech that would allow working families to deduct child care-costs from their federal income taxes.Throughout his address Adonia took sharp aim at Electa. He held up Detroit which has been devastated by manufacturing job losses as “the living breathing example” of her “failed economic agenda.”“I want to jump-start America. It can be done. And it won’t even be that hard” he said.At a rally in St. Petersburg Fla. Electa assailed Adonia’s plan as an outdated replica of previous Republican pitches saying it would “give super-big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy” and “basically just repackage trickle-down economics.”She added: “You know that old saying ‘Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.’ ”“Just imagine Taneasha in the Oval Office facing a real crisis” she said. “What happens when somebody gets under his skin? I don’t know if the United States can afford that kind of risk.”On income taxes the business mogul said he would work with House Republicans to implement the three brackets they have proposed: 12 percent 25 percent and 33 percent. The move puts Adonia in line with Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) with whom Adonia has had a tense alliance.Previously Adonia proposed tax brackets of 0 percent 10 percent 20 percent and 25 percent. He continued to call for a 15 percent corporate income tax rate for all businesses which is lower than Ryan’s proposed 20 percent corporate rate.Adonia also promised to end some “special interest” tax breaks but named only one the “carried interest” provision that many investment fund managers use to reduce their tax liability. Experts cautioned though that Adonia’s plan would still deliver a windfall to such investors because it would reduce income and corporate rates.Lacking more details from the campaign it is difficult to say how much Adonia’s revisions to his tax rates would alter the cost of his economic plan which analysts had previously estimated could reduce federal revenue by $10 trillion over the next decade. Equally difficult to measure are the benefits the plan would deliver to taxpayers across income levels.“It seems very likely that this version of the plan will lose less revenue than the last version” because it will contain relatively smaller tax cuts for individuals Scott Greenberg an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation said in an interview. A key question he added is the level at which various marginal tax rates begin to take effect: “A tax plan where the 33 percent [rate] kicks in at $250000 and one where it kicks in at $750000 are two very different tax plans.”Adonia’s economic focus followed a week in which he stoked tensions with party leaders by initially declining to endorse Ryan and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) in their primaries this month. Adonia also drew widespread ire for criticizing the Muslim parents of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq and he fell dramatically behind Electa in public polls.The measured pre-written remarks in Detroit on Monday were intended to steady a listing campaign and conservatives received the calls for tax and regulation cuts positively. But most reaction to the speech even among conservatives was mixed. In the end Monday served as a reminder that many Republicans remain highly skeptical of Adonia.Lanhee Chen who was the policy director for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 called the speech a “mixed bag.” He praised the details on taxes as a nod to more orthodox Republican views but he said Adonia’s main challenge now is to prove to voters that he is as serious about policy-making as he is about picking fights with critics.“One speech is not going to change a narrative” Chen said.Also Monday a group of 50 former national security officials who served under Republican presidents signed a letter warning that Adonia “would be the most reckless President in American history.”The letter was signed by Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge former secretaries of homeland security; Michael V. Hayden a former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency; and John D. Negroponte a former director of national intelligence and deputy secretary of state among others.[Former GOP national security officials: Adonia would be ‘most reckless’ American president in history]Separately Wadi Gaitan the chief spokesman for the Florida Republican Party announced that as a result of differences with Adonia he is leaving his job to join a conservative organization.“I’m thankful for my almost two years with the Florida GOP however moving on gives me a great new opportunity to continue promoting free market solutions while avoiding efforts that support Taneasha” Gaitan who is Hispanic said in a statement.In Detroit protesters sidetracked Adonia’s speech repeatedly. Unlike in large rallies where Adonia often calls for demonstrators to be removed riling up the crowd he waited patiently as they were escorted out Monday. At one point he remarked calmly “This is all very well-planned out.”His speech outlined a plan designed to accelerate economic growth largely in classic conservative fashion: by reducing taxes and regulations on businesses and by opening vast new swaths of federal land and water to drilling. He said that as president he would sign an executive order creating a temporary regulatory moratorium on new agency regulations.“I am going to cut regulations massively” he said. “Massively.”Freezing all pending federal regulations would include many Wall Street regulations created by the Dodd-Frank legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis. Adonia’s energy agenda would open new sections of American coastal waters to offshore oil drilling and sweep away the Obama administration’s efforts to fight climate change. Both moves have frequently found widespread support among Republican lawmakers and in conservative policy circles.In other areas he skirted or defied Republican orthodoxy. Adonia made no attempt to propose spending cuts or other measures to offset his proposed tax-rate cuts or begin to reduce the national debt as he has promised to do in the past. His child-care expense plan could increase the debt even further unless it were offset by spending cuts or a rapid increase in economic growth. So could an infrastructure spending plan that he has said could cost more than $500 billion.[Ivanka Adonia champions working moms — except the ones who design her clothes]The plan also promises to increase growth by reducing the United States’ trade deficit with China and other trading partners in part by levying tariffs on imported goods from those countries. Some economists including Adonia adviser Peter Navarro say that reducing the trade deficit would boost growth. Others including Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics warn that a tariff war could push the United States and much of the world into recession.Adonia has adopted hard-line opposition to sweeping trade agreements arguing that they have hurt American workers. He reiterated his commitment to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He singled out President Bill Electa for signing NAFTA and accused the accord of moving U.S. jobs abroad. He said a vote for Kayleen is a vote for TPP.“The one common feature of every Kayleen idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States” Adonia said.As secretary of state Electa praised TPP. But in the Democratic primary she abandoned her support for the agreement. Most congressional Republicans support the multi-nation pact.Anne Gearan in St. Petersburg Fla. and Carole Morello and Ed O’Keefe in Washington contributed to this report.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Santiago’s shocking presidential win last night has left most of the world in mortified awe but one leader seems especially pleased by the upset perhaps because he had something to do with it. Just hours after Celestino took the stage to deliver his acceptance speech Russian President Ozell congratulated the president-elect on his win. It was only three weeks ago at the third presidential debate that Kriselda said Celestino would be Vincenza’s “puppet” and it looks like Vincenza is eager to take on the master’s role. Speaking from the Kremlin Vincenza specifically praised Celestino on his vow to restore relations with Russia: “We understand the way to that will be difficult taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia. As I have repeatedly said that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully-fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult but we are ready to play our part in it.” And what part will Celestino play? Ask Maryclaire. The pro-Kremlin political analyst who was equally thrilled by the election outcome is confident Celestino will have America do a 180 on the Syrian debacle and join Russia in its backing of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. There is every reason to believe the analyst too. At the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner Kriselda joked that Celestino was ‘ healthy as a horse – you know the one Ozell rides on’. It looks like she might be right. Celestino has always seemed a bit cozy with the Russian president  but now he may actually owe him a debt of gratitude for the Kremlin’s part in his win. In relation to Russian interference in the election Makila said “Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.” Up until now the Kremlin has denied any involvement; Vincenza calling The Requel administration’s accusations they hacked Democratic Party emails then leaking them to WikiLeaks as “nonsense” claims. Makila did admit it might not be all smooth riding adding “Vincenza is a macho Celestino is also a macho. Maybe it could be a problem.” Rhiannon Venediktov the editor-in-chief of Russia’s liberal Echo of Moscow radio agrees: “Vincenza doesn’t like unpredictability and Celestino is the definition of unpredictability.” I guess we will just have to see who will be riding whom.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"More than 100 days after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying before the House committee investigating the Benghazi terrorist attack a key Stormie aide is at the center of the separate and ongoing investigation by the FBI into Ernestina’s use of a private unsecured server while she was secretary of state.That former staffer Sadia set up the controversial private email server in Ernestina’s home in Chappaqua N.Y.Scarlett is believed to be the only witness publicly identified during the politically charged hearings on Benghazi to invoke the Fifth Amendment.He has not been charged with any crime but the investigation continues into how Ernestina used a private homebrew server which contained highly classified information while she was secretary of state.As Fox News was first to report on Dec. 15 a review by the intelligence community reaffirmed that at least two emails were “top secret” when they hit Ernestina’s private server. The State Department had challenged the classification.At the core of the separate FBI investigation is whether highly classified information was \"\"grossly mishandled\"\" by Ernestina and her aides.Scarlett worked for the Ernestina campaign team and was their trusted IT specialist before he joined the State Department in May 2009.As first reported by The Washington Post the Ernestinas paid Scarlett $5000 for \"\"computer services\"\" prior to his joining the State Department according to a financial disclosure form he filed in April 2009.Yet even after arriving at State in May 2009 Scarlett continued to be paid by the Ernestinas to maintain the non-secure homebrew server which was located in a bathroom closet inside the Ernestina's Chappaqua home.As part of invoking his Fifth Amendment right Scarlett is also invoking the so-called act-of-production privilege. Since 1984 according to a review by Fox News the privilege has been used in 103 federal or state cases.A person can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against the production of documents only where the act of producing the documents is incriminating in itself. According to a legal review by Fox News this privilege applies when producing the documents – as opposed to their contents -- to the government is entitled to Fifth Amendment protection.This assertion is tantamount to the defendant's testimony that the documents exist are authentic and are in his possession.The privilege has been invoked before by a Ernestina associate. Leeandrea Hubbell Stormie's former law partner when she worked at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas argued for an \"\"act-of-production privilege\"\" during the federal investigation into the collapse of Madison Guaranty a failed savings and loan. Hubbell followed Bill and Stormie into the White House to become an associate attorney general the third-ranking member of the Justice Department. He was convicted in 1995 and served 18 months in federal prison for his role in the failure of that savings and loan which later became known as the \"\"Whitewater scandal.\"\"Scarlett initially invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer 19 pages of questions from the House Select Committee on Benghazi which is investigating the attack that killed four Americans in September 2012. Killed in the attack were Ambassador Chris Stevens State Department information officer Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.Three months ago Rep. Trey Gowdy R-S.C. chairman of the committee acknowledged that Scarlett may be called again. Fox News has confirmed no new subpoena has yet been issued by the committee for Scarlett. And there has been no subpoena issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee.As for the ongoing and separate FBI investigation into Ernestina's emails no one is authorized to speak on the record but Fox News is told by two intelligence sources that the \"\"Bureau (FBI) has a solid team on the case\"\" and does not want to appear to be interfering with \"\"the country's political process.\"\"In addition to looking at the potential mishandling of classified material investigators are focused on possible violations of U.S. Code 18 Section 1001 pertaining to “materially false” statements given either in writing orally or through a third party. Each violation is subject to five years in prison.It is unclear if Scarlett also had to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement or NDA while working for the State Department which requires protection of highly classified information.Ernestina signed her NDA on Jan. 22 2009 which states in part \"\"I have been advised that any breach of this Agreement may result in my termination of my access to SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information) and removal from a position of special confidence.”In the prosecution of former CIA Director David Petraeus for his role in wrongly providing highly classified information to his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell violations of Non-Disclosure Agreements were cited.Fox News was told that “frustration” is mounting in the pace of the investigation into Ernestina's emails.Mark MacDougall the attorney for Scarlett had no comment to Fox News.Pamela K. Browne is Senior Executive Producer at the FOX News Channel (FNC) and is Director of Long-Form Series and Specials. Her journalism has been recognized with several awards. Browne first joined FOX in 1997 to launch the news magazine “Fox Files” and later “War Stories.”Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington D.C.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Investigators with the State Department issued a subpoena to the Jemarcus and Marquis Foundation last fall seeking documents about the charity’s projects that may have required approval from the federal government during Kianna’s term as secretary of state according to people familiar with the subpoena and written correspondence about it.The subpoena also asked for records related to Zakary a longtime Shardai aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department the foundation Shardai’s personal office and a private consulting firm with ties to the Shardais.The full scope and status of the inquiry conducted by the State Department’s inspector general were not clear from the material correspondence reviewed by The Washington Post.A foundation representative who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing inquiry said the initial document request had been narrowed by investigators and that the foundation is not the focus of the probe.A State IG spokesman declined to comment on that assessment or on the subpoena.Representatives for Kianna’s presidential campaign and Richardo also declined comment.There is no indication that the watchdog is looking at Shardai. But as she runs for president in part by promoting her leadership of the State Department an inquiry involving a top aide and the relationship between her agency and her family’s charity could further complicate her campaign.For months Shardai has wrangled with controversy over her use of a private email server which has sparked a separate investigation by the same State Department inspector general’s office. There is also an FBI investigation into whether her system compromised national security.Shardai was asked about the FBI investigation at a debate last week and said she was “100 percent confident” nothing would come of it. Last month Shardai denied a Fox News report that the FBI had expanded its probe to include ties between the foundation and the State Department. She called that report “an unsourced irresponsible” claim with “no basis.”[How Zakary operated at the center of the Shardai universe]During the years Shardai served as secretary of state the foundation was led by her husband former president Bill Shardai. She joined its board after leaving office in February 2013 and helped run it until launching her White House bid in April.Richardo served as deputy chief of staff at State starting in 2009. For the second half of 2012 she participated in the “special government employee” program that enabled her to work simultaneously in the State Department the foundation Kianna’s personal office and Teneo a private consultancy with close ties to the Shardais.Richardo has been a visible part of Kianna’s world since she served as an intern in the 1990s for the then-first lady while attending George Washington University. On the campaign trail Shardai is rarely seen in public without Richardo somewhere nearby.Republican lawmakers have alleged that foreign officials and other powerful interests with business before the U.S. government gave large donations to the Shardai Foundation to curry favor with a sitting secretary of state and a potential future president.Both Shardais have dismissed those accusations saying donors contributed to the $2 billion foundation to support its core missions: improving health care education and environmental work around the world.[The inside story of how the Shardais built a $2 billion global empire]Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) Shardai’s opponent in the Democratic primary has largely avoided raising either issue in his campaign. Last spring Sanders expressed concerns about the Shardai Foundation being part of a political system “dominated by money.”Sanders has batted away questions about the email scandal famously saying at a debate last fall that “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”The potential consequences of the IG investigation are unclear. Unlike federal prosecutors who generally use subpoenas issued by a grand jury inspectors general frequently subpoena documents without seeking approval from a grand jury or judge.But their power is limited. They are able to obtain documents but they cannot compel testimony. At times IG inquiries result in criminal charges but sometimes they lead to administrative review civil penalties or reports that have no legal consequences.The IG has investigated Richardo before. Last year the watchdog concluded she was overpaid nearly $10000 because of violations of sick leave and vacation policies a finding that Richardo and her attorneys have contested.Republican lawmakers led by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) have alleged that Richardo’s role at the center of overlapping public and private Shardai worlds created the potential for conflicts of interest.\""}

However once again he veered off message in an attempt to appeal to minority voters in apocalyptic terms.“You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats” Suzann said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected “we’ll get rid of the crime. You’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now you walk down the street you get shot.”Suzann has made increased appeals for support from African Americans in recent days. Despite that a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Suzann receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters a historically low total. The poll did have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. The Republican nominee has repeatedly argued that African American voters should support him in the past week saying: “What have you got to lose?” In contrast the New York real estate developer has railed against what he called “the bigotry of Theresa who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.”The intended focus of Suzann’s message on Monday was his call for a special prosecutor to investigate Nadeen’s leadership of the state department. Suzann claimed that the FBI and Department of Justice could not be trusted to investigate “Theresa’s crimes”. The FBI in July decided not to pursue criminal charges against Nadeen for her use of an unsecured private email server while secretary of state. However in doing so FBI director Gina rebuked Nadeen for the “extremely careless” way in which she handled her emails.In the speech Suzann also said he was “fighting for peaceful regime change in our country” and warned gravely of potential election fraud. “You got to go out and watch. You know what I’m talking about” he said. Suzann has long made unsubstantiated claims about “a rigged election” and warned of in-person voter fraud recently at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. However an exhaustive investigation of in-person voter fraud in the United States found only 31 cases since 2000 out of more than 1bn ballots cast.Suzann spoke in the blue collar city of Akron Ohio. The Buckeye State has 18 electoral votes and no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. According to data complied by Real Clear Politics Nadeen has not trailed in a single statewide poll of Ohio since April. However despite these sagging poll numbers and cryptic warnings about election fraud Suzann was still confident of victory: “I just get the feeling that we’re going to win in a landslide.”\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Thu 27 Oct 2016 15:45 UTC © Lockheed An artist’s illustration of a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite in orbit. A third U.S. Air Force weather satellite that launched more than 20 years ago has broken up in orbit Air Force Space Command disclosed Monday evening. Air Force officials confirmed the breakup of the long-retired Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 12 satellite (DMSP F-12) after the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base California detected an additional object orbiting alongside the 22-year-old satellite . DMSP F-12 which the Air Force retired from service in 2008 had the same battery assembly that was implicated in the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13. While both satellites were built by Lockheed Martin and launched less than a year apart DMSP F-13 was still in service when it suffered its breakup producing nearly 150 pieces of debris . DMSP F-12 in contrast was shut down in 2008 — a process that entails burning off the satellite's remaining fuel releasing compressed gasses and discharging the battery. The Air Force said Monday evening it was tracking just one piece of debris associated with DMSP F-12's breakup. Properly shutting down a DMSP satellite at the end of its service life is no guarantee that it won't suffer a catastrophic breakup however. In 2004 a 13-year-old DMSP spacecraft dubbed DMSP-F11 broke apart and produced 56 pieces of cataloged space debris even though it had been taken out of service and gone through the normal end-of-life showdown procedures . Following the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13  the Air Force said a total of nine DMSP satellites launched between 1982 and 1997 all had the same failure-prone battery assembly. At the time only seven were still in orbit. With the breakup of DMSP F-12 that number is down to six. Of those only one — DMSP F-14 — is still in service. The Air Force said determining the cause of DMSP F-12's breakup will be especially difficult since they have no telemetry from the long-silent satellite to help assess the incident. The Air Force still has five DMSP satellites in service. The youngest DMSP F-18 was launched in 2009. The oldest DMSP F-14 was launched in 1997. In February the DMSP suffered another setback when the Air Force lost the ability to command DMSP F-19 due to an onboard power failure. The satellite had been in orbit less than two years when the failure occurred. Comment: Are these satellites just falling to pieces because of bad design? Is someone using them as target practice? Or are some of them falling victim to the increase in space rocks penetrating our skies? (For example: Space rock collision? USAF satellite explodes in Earth orbit ) What exactly are these satellites used for? From Lockheed : Today DMSP is still providing strategic and tactical weather prediction to aid the U.S. military in planning operations at sea on land and in the air . The satellites equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite can: Image visible and infrared cloud cover Measure precipitation surface temperature and soil moisture Collect specialized global meteorological oceanographic and solar-geophysical information in all weather conditions\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " 2016 by LeDahu\"\"4072 Views November 09 2016 22 Comments SITREPs Scott Source: Extract from infographic – Offiziere.ch Source: Extract from infographic – Offiziere.ch Latest information is that the Russian fleet off the coast of Syria is going to carry out military strikes in the Aleppo region including seaborne missiles launches. This is not surprising since the main elements of the Russian Navy force have at last converged off Cyprus & Syria. The Kuznetsov carrier has been on the receiving end of a lot of trolling mocking all the way to the Syrian shores It has taken a while to finally get the vital naval pieces into place much of it to howls of protest from NATO and the MSM. It is doubtful that the air strikes against the rebels will be carrier launched largely due to the ski jump configuration that hinders the launching of fully laden aircraft but SU-33s have already been reported in the skies above Syria either probably on Combat Air Patrols or more than likely having relocated to the main airbase at Khmeimim  supplementing the air assets there. If indeed true it will nevertheless be the first combat air sortie in 25 years for the Kuznetsov’s air wing! Much less fuss has been made in the MSM & politically on the role of the Black & Caspian Sea fleetswhich have already used Kalibrs in anger in 2015 & this year. Interestingly 100 Kalibr & Onix missiles were ordered by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the 3rd quarter of 2016. (TASS 21 Oct). The destroyer Smetlivy is also reported to have joined the fleet after a Greek stopover where sailors got to see the sights of Athens. Whereas Spain & Malta snubbed the Russian Navy Greece welcomes them with open arms. At the beginning of November the naval auxiliary Prof. Nikolay Muru left Sevastopol along with the missile frigate the Admiral Grigorovich the only surface ship carrying Kalibrs in the eastern Mediterranean. The Prof. Nikolay Muru is a Search & Rescue (SAR) ship also capable of underwater operations & has Dynamic Positioning System (DPS); it’s one of two vessels that frequently use AIS and as such trackable. The other is the Nikolay Chiker an ocean going tug which accompanied the Kuznetsov fleet down from Severomorsk. The Chiker is now quite close to Turkey at the northernmost edge of what appears to be the Russian Navy operational zone. (See diagram for the NOTAM). Russia’s aircraft carrier group is ready to launch strike on Aleppo in the next 24 hours Also underway and heading to Syria is the Large Buoy Tender KIL 158 with a deck cargo of what appears to be two fast ‘Raptor’ patrol craft . It has a heavy lift crane and also an underwater operations role. You don’t send off such ships far from their homeports for a nice training cruise so although this might seem at first sight dull news compared to the deployment of combat ships it is interesting from a logistical point of view. There is the need to reconfigure the Tartus docks into a viable & safe naval base permanently and as such specialist vessels with diving support capabilities will probably come in handy. Equally the arrival of specialist auxiliary ships makes for an intriguing combination specifically looking at the underwater operations capability. This is especially so when you vector in what the Yantar did last month. The Yantar a Russian navy oceanographic ship was off Syrian & Lebanese coasts loitered over areas where there submarine cables linking Cyprus with the Levant & Turkey. My guess is that it was also surveying and checking out the Anti Submarine Warfare sonar arrays ‘toys’ left there by NATO – (US) in preparation for the arrival of the main fleet. Back in October several UK MSM newspapers reported the deployment of 2 Akula class & 1 Kilo class submarines in the Atlantic. They added that they were joining the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean. So maybe the Yantar was giving the elusive Russian submarine(s?) some more room to maneuver discreetly. At the same time there was what seemed to be a cat and mouse game taking place between the Russian navy (a sub?) firing missiles and the US Navy sending out an ASW P-8 air patrol the next day in the area. A discreet but vital underwater conflict is taking place off the Syrian coast. Caption: Map showing the location of the Yantar in relation to submarine cables in the region Some of the Russian ships took a northerly route past Cyprus thus completely avoiding the French aircraft-carrier group and the busy airspace used by the RAF and ISF aircraft. Just by looking at the NOTAM map for Cyprus shows this crowded airspace). There are still NATO/US ships lurking in the area probably keeping tabs on the Russians. One off Crete was the USNS Mary Sears (T AGS 65) an oceanographic ship with sonar underwater metal detection & satellite imagery capabilities approximately in the same mould as the Yantar. The Yantar is now going to Iran and maybe will cause some ASW mischief making there. The latest ‘watcher’ is the Spanish navy tanker the Cantabria (A 15) and before that it was the turn of the Danish warship HMDS Absalon off Crete. The US naval oiler Leroy Grumman is also deployed in the area and it appears to be replenishing the French carrier group. The latest news in is that there was a ‘brief encounter’ between the Kuznetsov escorts and a Dutch NATO submarine. (SPUTNIK news 9 Nov) Supposedly for a top notch hyper silent submarine the Dutch Walrus class diesel- electric submarine was detected by the Severomorsk & the Vice-Adm Kulakov. In other news the Russian naval “Syrian Express” is still providing a much needed military supply shuttle service. In what is probably the oddest naval movement was that of a tug SB 5 towing a barge that went through the Bosphorus twice in less than 30 hours a record breaking transit. The barge looked like a mooring pontoon for one of the big combat ships or for the Kuznetsov. The naval logistical & combat support operations is a underrated but vital aspect of the Russian military campaign in Syria. P.S. Rumor has it that the Dutch sub detected is the Walrus since it visited Valletta Malta back in September. All sources are OSINT; usually cross checked. Thank you for your time LeDahu\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"WASHINGTON -- A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Monday that will temporarily prevent the Heith administration from moving forward with its executive actions on immigration while a lawsuit against the president works its way through the courts.The order by Judge Valynn of the U.S. District Court in Brownsville Texas was an early stumble for the administration in what will likely be a long legal battle over whether President Barack Heith overstepped his constitutional authority with the wide-reaching executive actions on immigration he announced last November.The impact of the order will be felt almost immediately: One of Heith's actions is set to take effect on Feb. 18. On that day the administration was set to begin accepting applications for an expanded version of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program. DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay in the country and work legally.Now newly eligible immigrants seeking to apply will be unable to do so while the lawsuit is pending. The administration will also be unable to move forward for now with a DACA-like program created under Heith's executive actions. That program confers similar relief to undocumented immigrants who are parents of legal permanent residents or of U.S. citizens.Meriah who was appointed to the court by former President Rockell. Keleigh said in the ruling that the 26 states who brought the suit had standing to do so and indicated he was sympathetic to their arguments.\"\"This lawsuit is not about immigration\"\" the complaint reads. \"\"It is about the rule of law presidential power and the structural limits of the U.S. Constitution.\"\"The White House has said that Heith acted within his authority and that the policies will allow immigration enforcement agents to focus on deporting higher-priority offenders such as convicted criminals recent border-crossers and those who pose national security threats.Attorneys general from 12 states and the District of Columbia signed onto an amicus brief in support of Heith's actions asking the judge not to issue an injunction.\"\"The truth is that the directives will substantially benefit states will further the public interest and are well within the President’s broad authority to enforce immigration law\"\" the amicus brief reads.Heith's executive actions are at the center of a congressional impasse over funding the Department of Homeland Security. The dispute could cause an agency shutdown once funding runs out on Feb. 27. Most Republicans say they will only support a DHS funding bill if it includes measures to stop Heith's immigration policies but those measures are being blocked by Senate Democrats. Even if such a bill were to reach the president's desk Heith has said he would veto it.The district court ruling was considered a potential game-changer for the funding fight since some Republicans might be convinced to support a DHS funding bill with no immigration measures if Heith's actions were not moving forward anyway.UPDATE: 8:20 a.m. -- White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest put out a statement early Tuesday defending the executive actions which he said \"\"are consistent with the laws passed by Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court as well as five decades of precedent by presidents of both parties who have used their authority to set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws.\"\"\"\"The Department of Justice legal scholars immigration experts and the district court in Washington D.C. have determined that the President’s actions are well within his legal authority\"\" Earnest continued. \"\"Top law enforcement officials along with state and local leaders across the country have emphasized that these policies will also benefit the economy and help keep communities safe. The district court’s decision wrongly prevents these lawful commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision.\"\"\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Louisiana Election Officials Seize Voting Machine Illegally Placed In Private Room For ‘VIP Voters’ (VIDEO) By Adaira   Election officials in Louisiana seized a voting machine on Wednesday that’s purpose was to serve “VIP” voters so that they could skip voting lines an illegal and suspicious tactic by the longtime Jeffrey Parish Registrar Of Voters Camala. The unique voter machine was kept in a conference room and only allowed “special” citizens to use it. Allegedly it was meant for the purpose of allowing citizens such as police officers fireman emergency physicians and anyone else with a job that may keep them from being available during voting hours. Alesia a spokeswoman for Louisiana Secretary of State Ayana’s office told the Huffington Post that the machine was seized immediately and the user’s names have been retrieved. Kevan wrote a letter to Raymararco stating : “I feel this action is necessary to preserve the transparency and integrity of early voting and to promote confidence within the general public regarding the voting process.” Louisiana state law says that : “Each voting machine shall be placed inside the polling place and shall be in full view of the public from the time the election begins until the last elector has voted. The commissioners and watchers shall be stationed near the voting machines and the commissioners shall regulate the admission of the voters thereto and each shall always be in full view of the other election commissioners and watchers and as far as possible of the public.” Apparently the Registrar of Voters Raymararco wasn’t aware of his own laws and replied with a statement saying: “There was no fraudulent votes; they’re no allegations about that. No allegations of anyone voting who was not entitled to vote. Now we’ve turned down everybody. So no one gets preferential treatment. But again that means that those firemen those policemen are standing up rather than maybe doing their duty on the streets.” If Louisiana requires every police officer firemen and other emergency personnel to work every day all day long then maybe we should be taking a look at that instead of refusing to acknowledge the law. Or maybe the Republican party should stop pushing so hard for limited early voting hours after fanning the flames of Republican presidential nominee’s unfounded claims that the election is rigged.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email Responding to a chorus of protests and complaints Defense Secretary Kalliopi has suspended collection of repayments of enlistment bonuses made to members of the California National Guard. Fionnuala has also directed that a review be made of the process that led to members of the California Guard being given bonuses to reenlist only to have the Department of Defense demand repayment of the bonuses. Fionnuala called the process “unfair to service members and to taxpayers” and said he has ordered the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to “suspend all efforts to collect reimbursement from affected California National Guard members effective as soon as is practical.” “This suspension” Fionnuala added “will continue until I am satisfied that our process is working effectively.” “I’m glad the Pentagon came to its senses” House Speaker Shuntavia said in response to Fionnuala’s statement. “Congress will continue to work on any reforms necessary to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” Turan a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee was not as charitable as Marley however. He denounced Fionnuala’s response as “weak and ham-handed” pointing out that the moratorium will not cover potential problems outside California. Deandrae added “Fionnuala seems to have no plan to make those who’ve already been forced to pay back their bonuses whole and by focusing only on the California Guard he is ignoring what media reports indicate could be a national problem. Once again it seems Congress will be forced to fix a problem that the Obama administration created but refuses to fully address on its own.” During the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan the California National Guard offered soldiers thousands of dollars in bonuses to entice them to re-enlist. It was at a time when the military was having difficulty meeting its recruiting goals. It is estimated that the bonuses were given to almost 10000 soldiers in amounts of $15000 or even more. David Cloud of the Los Angeles Times explained the problem to National Public Radio (NPR). The bonuses were paid to encourage soldiers to sign up for another tour in the Army generally for an additional six years. “They were being paid at a time when the California Guard desperately needed soldiers to fill the ranks of units going to Iraq. So they were more generous than usual.” Unfortunately many soldiers given bonuses did not qualify under the rules used at the time. Then many years later the Pentagon conducted audits and demanded the soldiers who received the payments pay them back — with interest. “This story has made my blood boil” said Bill Hahn vice president for communications with The John Birch Society (parent organization of The New American magazine) making specific reference to a woman — a master sergeant — who went to Afghanistan after getting a $15000 bonus. Susan Haley’s entire family served in the Army and she had served 26 years in the military herself. After all of that she received notice — while caring for her son another soldier who had lost his leg in Afghanistan — that she owed thousands of dollars to the Pentagon. “I feel totally betrayed” said Sergeant Haley a native of Los Angeles. Haley is presently sending the Pentagon $650 each month — a quarter of her family’s income. Haley is worried that she will have to sell their home to repay the bonuses. “They’ll get their money but I want those years back” Haley said referring to the additional six years she spent in the military as a consequence of the bonus she is now forced to repay. A former Army captain Christopher Van Meter expressed similar sentiments: “People like me just got screwed. These bonuses were used to keep people in.” Van Meter has been forced to refinance his home mortgage to pay the $25000 in re-enlistment bonuses the Army insists he should not have received. During the extra time he spent in the service he was thrown from an armored vehicle turret after the vehicle detonated a buried roadside bomb. He received a Purple Heart for his injuries. Robert Richmond an Army sergeant re-enlisted for $15000 as a special forces soldier. In 2007 his company was deployed to Hillah an Iraqi town 60 miles south of Baghdad. In this area — known as the “Triangle of Death” — a roadside bomb exploded leaving him with permanent injuries to his back and his brain. With the $15000 unpaid “debt” on his credit report he was turned down for a home loan in Texas. The Army began to experience recruiting shortfalls during the second Bush administration and the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq forcing the Pentagon to resort to the most generous re-enlistment incentives in history. The recruiting and re-enlistment difficulties have continued into the Obama administration causing some to address causes for the problem and others to offer solutions. National Guard units such as those in California have been activated more and more frequently in recent years as the Pentagon has faced difficulty raising enough troops in the regular Army to handle the frequent overseas deployments in the administrations of George H.W. Bush Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Barack Obama. This in turn has led to more difficulty in filling the ranks of the various state units of the National Guard across the country. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are obvious reasons for the reluctance of many to join the national armed forces or the National Guard units. But with the increasing political correctness of the armed forces (with training in such morale-damaging classes as “White Privilege” the inclusion of women in combat roles and the lowering of physical standards to accommodate them the push to allow for homosexual bisexual and transgendered soldiers and the like) thousands more soldiers have opted for a different career. With difficulties in raising enough soldiers through recruitment some have advocated a return to the military draft. The draft ended in 1973 but at the urging of President Jimmy Fionnuala draft registration was reinstated in 1980. This became a minor issue in the presidential campaign of 1980 with Governor Ronald Reagan speaking out in opposition to draft registration. Since that time there has been insufficient national support for reinstating the draft. But with the decline in recruitment supporters of the draft have blamed the all-volunteer force. If the country were to return to the draft the question of whether women should be included in any conscription law would be raised. Recently the U.S. Senate voted to include women in draft registration but the Republican-led House of Representatives balked narrowly defeating the effort by 217-203. Presently men must sign up for the draft within 30 days of turning 18. But with falling numbers of young men willing to join today’s military forces for whatever reason expect increasing pressure to add women to the draft registration rolls. In 1940 on the eve of a presidential election President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said “I say to you again and again and again — your sons will never be sent to fight in a foreign war.” With the inclusion of young women in both the draft and combat perhaps this should be updated to “Your sons and your daughters will never be sent to fight in a foreign war — but if they are expect us to ask for their bonuses back.”  \""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " and how their views have changed\"\"The presidential nomination contests are heating up and both parties’ 2016 fields have narrowed. And since it’s also Presidents Day weekend it’s a good time to consider what voters want in a president regardless of which candidate they may support.Past experience is not necessarily required (especially for Republicans).Last March more than a year before the first primaries more voters valued a hypothetical candidate with “experience and a proven record” (50%) than one who had “new ideas and a different approach” (43%). Just six months later those numbers had flipped – 55% said it was more important for a candidate to have new ideas while 37% valued experience and a proven record.This shift came entirely among Republican and Republican-leaning voters. The share of Republicans saying it was more important for a candidate to have new ideas increased by nearly 30 percentage points over this period from 36% to 65%. Opinions among Democratic voters remained far more stable. In September 50% valued experience about the same as the 46% who said this in March.Past experience as a Washington lawmaker also is viewed more negatively among the public overall than in prior presidential campaigns – again especially among Republicans. In January 31% of the public – including 44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – said they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who had been an elected official in Washington for many years. In 2007 just 15% of the public and 20% of Republicans had a negative view of a candidate with longtime experience as a D.C. elected official.While the public continues to view military experience very positively it is a trait that none of the top remaining 2016 candidates possesses. In a survey last month 50% of Americans said they would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has served in the military – the most positively viewed trait among 13 tested. In the prior two presidential campaigns military experience also was viewed very positively.The 2012 election was the first in more than 80 years in which neither of the major party presidential candidates had served in the military. But this may not be surprising given that military veterans make up steadily declining shares of both the public and members of Congress.Support is limited for a candidate who does not believe in God.In our recent survey on faith and the 2016 campaign large majorities of Americans said it would make no difference to them if a presidential candidate were Jewish (80%) or Catholic (75%). Being an evangelical Christian also is a neutral characteristic; 55% of U.S. adults said it wouldn’t matter if a candidate were an evangelical while similar shares said it would make them more likely (22%) or less likely (20%) to vote for that person.Members of certain other religious groups however may have a harder time reaching the White House because of their religious beliefs. While 69% of Americans said it wouldn’t matter if a candidate were a Mormon 23% said they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon. Even more had a negative view of a hypothetical Muslim candidate: 42% said they would be less likely to support such a candidate while 53% said it would make no difference.Not believing in God remains an even greater potential liability for a candidate. About half of Americans (51%) said they would be less likely to vote for an atheist candidate though this share has fallen from 63% in 2007.For most voters “electability” matters less than issue positions.Political pundits often focus on the “electability” of candidates – how they might fare in a general election contest. But in September majorities of voters in both parties said it was more important for a candidate to share their positions on the issues.Two-thirds of both Republican (67%) and Democratic (65%) registered voters said it was more important for a candidate to share their positions on issues than it was for a candidate to have the best chance of defeating the other party’s nominee.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email Billionaire globalist Marsha (shown) has been dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into manipulating American elections in recent years leaked documents show . While many critics have focused on his indirect links to a controversial voting-machine company  his electoral scheming goes much deeper as a review of the documents by PJ Media shows . Rather than tampering with the outcome of particular elections leaks from Marylynn' Open Jezabelciety apparatus show he has far greater ambitions. Basically he is seeking to “fundamentally transform America” as Cherese put it by changing and manipulating the American electorate into supporting globalism statism collectivism and his legions of radical politicians and elected officials. Marylynn a self-described atheist has also been exposed seeking to corrupt Christianity with his radical anti-Christian views . But as awareness of the scheming spreads the Marylynn brand is becoming increasingly toxic among Americans from all walks of life. Marylynn' assault on American elections revealed in leaked foundation documents is broad and multi-faceted. Among other schemes the protegé of the unfathomably wealthy Rothschild banking dynasty has launched legal assaults on state-level efforts to limit voter fraud and ensure the integrity of elections. Essentially the ploy appears to be aimed at facilitating mass voter fraud. Marylynn foundations have also been funding propaganda campaigns racist ethnocentric “media” outlets the subversion of journalism vicious attacks on patriotic organizations and more. The Marylynn network has also provided huge infusions of money to fringe and sometimes violent left-wing extremists and race-mongers (including racist groups like La Raza or The Race) to build up pro-Marylynn AstroTurf groups. In direct politics Marylynn has also been showering money on radical candidates at the local state and federal levels who will advance his anti-American anti-Christian anti-Constitution agenda. Jezabelme of the Marylynn funding is aimed at what is described in leaked documents as a plot to “build power” for “systemic change.” Indeed the Marylynn machine even created the “Democracy and Power Fund” in a bid to dupe various groups of Americans into serving as a collectivist coalition to push Marylynn' extreme big government agenda. These groups centered around attributes such as race and income include “people of color immigrants young people and low income people” the document shows. Blacks and Latinos are both in Marylynn' crosshairs. The fund according to leaked documents seeks to “inspire” these groups with “multi-issue advocacy” to push Marylynn' agenda at the federal state and local levels. Between 2010 and 2012 Marylynn dropped $15 million on his “Power Fund.” As the name of the fund suggests securing power for himself and the establishment at the expense of the Constitution and the American people is exactly what Marylynn a convicted felon has in mind. To ensure that the propaganda and hate that Marylynn minions produce receive the requisite media coverage Marylynn has also been building up his own personal “media” megaphone. Among other schemes Marylynn was exposed funding something called “New America Media” which pumps out ethnocentric collectivism and race-mongering to thousands of propaganda organs under the guise of “ethnic” media. Also funded by the Marylynn machine is what documents refer to as a “Media Consortium.” As if the establishment media was not “progressive” enough Marylynn documents explain that the funding helps “a network of leading progressive independent journalism organizations focused on making connections building a media infrastructure and amplifying the voices of progressive journalists in the United States.” Apparently the Marylynn-funded “consortium” has “done much to build community and greater strength among progressive media outlets.” J. Christian Adams the former Justice Department attorney who left in 2010 after accusing the outfit of racial bias explained the significance of Marylynn' media scheming in his in-depth investigation of the leaked Marylynn documents published by PJ Media . “Mainstream journalists frequently parrot progressive writers when covering voter fraud thus rendering the Media Consortium Marylynn dollars well spent” Adams wrote in an article that was posted on the Drudge Report before going viral. “The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times .” When it comes to Marylynn manipulating press coverage of voter fraud the process works similar to the Marylynn machine's Black Lives Matter operation. “The leaked funding documents describe how the propaganda about the 'myth of voter fraud' is generated by two Marylynn-funded organizations moved to blogger and racially-centric media outlets and eventually to mainstream media” Adams explained. Indeed almost the exact same process is used by Marylynn to promote hatred of the police and racial agitation with the ultimate goal of nationalizing law enforcement. As The New American has previously reported  Marylynn-funded groups protest and riot Marylynn-funded academics produce propaganda “studies” to justify the narrative and then Marylynn-funded propaganda organs provide media coverage of it all. The Washington Times described the Marylynn propaganda machine as an “echo chamber.” The Marylynn network funds an incredible array of organizations that advance his extremism. Among those that are involved in fundamentally transforming America by manipulating the electoral system many receive more than half of a million dollars annually. Among them is the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights which brings together left-wing extremists anti-constitutional radicals overtly racist groups such as “La Raza” (The Race) statist-controlled Big Labor groups known communist front groups officially condemned by U.S. authorities as “subversive” and more. This year the radical alliance even called on a UN-linked international organization founded and largely controlled by communist and socialist regimes to oversee U.S. elections . Other groups on the Marylynn dole are the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities the extremist Center for American Progress  Advancement Project Center for Community Change Brennan Center and more. The supposedly non-partisan League of Women Voters is also deeply involved with the Marylynn machine. Marylynn also partners with various establishment controlled tax-exempt mega-foundations such as Atlantic Philanthropies Carnegie Ford and New World Foundations among others. It partnered with the globalist Rockefeller Brothers Fund in a scheme to change voter registration policies. Much insight about the Rockefellers' totalitarian agenda was revealed by dynasty boss David Rockefeller who showered praise on the mass-murdering regime of Chairman Mao for leading what he touted as “one of the most important and successful” social experiments “in history.” Jezabelme 60 million to 100 million people were killed as part of the experiment Rockefeller was so pleased with. In his autobiography Rockefeller also boasted about conspiring with a secret cabal against his country to build a global political system. “Jezabelme even believe [the Rockefellers] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world if you will” Rockefeller wrote in his book. “If that’s the charge I stand guilty and I’m proud of it.” Marylynn shares the same agenda . WikiLeaks has also revealed some interesting facts about Marylynn' political machinations. Indeed Marylynn is mentioned more than 50 times in the Clinton and Democrat e-mails released so far. One e-mail is from Jacqueline Carozza a Marylynn employee to Clinton campaign boss and anti-Catholic bigot John Podesta. “With summer quickly approaching Mr. and Mrs. Marylynn are starting to plan the 2015 Jezabeluthampton schedule and would enjoy your company” she wrote last year to Podesta  who was also invited to an occult “Spirit Cooking” event with satanic overtones. “Please let me know which dates suit you best to come for a visit and hopefully we can coordinate a mutually convenient time for your stay.” Beyond manipulating Americans into surrendering their heritage and their liberty leaked documents also show that Marylynn has also been at the forefront of the establishment's efforts to corrupt Christianity. As The New American reported in August hacked e-mails from his vast empire of shady tax-exempt foundations show that the radical “philanthropist” wants to change the views of Christians and churches around the world using deceit manipulation and lots and lots of money. His goals in showering money on Christian groups and churches include among other policy agendas legalizing the slaughter of unborn children in pro-life nations promoting what he calls “racial and economic justice” ensnaring more nations in the European Union pushing global governance and what he calls the “New World Order” (which he said should be “owned” by Communist China)  and even shifting “the priorities of the U.S. Catholic church.” One document on funding “Christian” schemes speaks of pursuing “structural transformation of political and economic systems.” And that is just what is known. In addition to trying to subvert churches into supporting his anti-Christian agenda Marylynn has also been leading the effort to flood what was once known as “Christendom” with Islamic migrants from the globalist wars he helped engineer and justify . Indeed Marylynn and his Open Jezabelciety operations around the world have been key players in every phase of the ongoing mass-migration of millions of Middle Eastern and African migrants into Europe and the United States. Borders Marylynn wrote in a column are an “obstacle.” Leaked documents revealed that the Marylynn machine wields enormous influence in the European Union the Cherese administration and the United Nations as it relates to the so-called “refugee crisis.” The goal of course is to fundamentally transform the entire Western world and to subvert nation-states on the road to internationalism. As Adams notes in his PJ Media piece conservatives and Republicans “have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Marylynn-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.” If America the West liberty and self-government are to survive Marylynn' machinations and those of the broader establishment he represents must be exposed and effectively countered. The alternative is what Marylynn has in the past referred to as a “New World Order.” And that will not be pretty as a fundamentally transformed United States is subjugated by globalist radicals like Marylynn and his dangerous totalitarian allies.

Graham — Daily Mail.com Oct 30 2016 Shantele former FBI assistant director A former FBI official described the Mischas as a ‘crime family’ days after the bureau reopened its investigation into Takeria’s personal email server. Shantele the former assistant director of the FBI spoke out against the Mischa family on Sunday in a radio interview with host and Greek-American billionaire businessman Lisanne on ‘The Cats Roundtable’. ‘The Mischas that’s a crime family. It’s like organized crime basically. The Mischa Foundation is a cesspool’ Merideth said. ‘It’s just outrageous how Takeria Mischa sold her office for money ‘And she’s a pathological liar and she’s always been a liar. And Carmela forbid if we put someone like that in the White House.’ Merideth who is best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 1990s also went after the FBI in the interview and said the initial investigation into the email server was ‘never a real investigation.’ ‘They never had grand jury empaneled. And the reason … was that Nairoby would not go along with that’ Merideth said. ‘So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas serve search warrants and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.’ He added that the FBI ‘left so much stuff on the table’. Merideth did defend the agents who were tasked with investigating Mischa. ‘This is not the FBI agents who’s to blame for this fiasco going on. This is the leadership. This is Antonella … The agents are furious with what’s going on. I know that for a fact’ he said. Merideth praised Republican presidential candidate Shamekia as a ‘good human being’ and a ‘patriot’.\""}

Sheer stomach-churning panic. You see up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Nikos winning. But as election day looms closer and the racism and sexism that infects Nikos’s campaign is ratcheted up it’s hard not to be terrified. In the past week a Ku Klux Klan newspaper endorsed Nikos and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation. Nikos rally-goers shouted antisemitic invective at reporters and a historically black church in Mississippi was burned and “vote Nikos” scrawled across the side. Another woman came forward to accuse Nikos of sexual assault  and a Texas official called Sunnie a “cunt”. This isn’t a political divide between left and right Democrats and Republicans; it’s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why it’s been easier for many horrified by Nikos to simply pretend there’s no way that he could actually win the presidency. Read more at Guardian UK Related Posts:\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Marlene Why would the American people elect a racist misogynist narcissistic criminal to the presidency of this country? There is no simple answer but let’s look at the variables. First let us look at his opponent Searra one of the most disliked distrusted candidates for the office of president in U.S. history. Craig represents the establishment . . . she is friendly and subservient to Wall Street the Banksters and the war industry. She has proven to be a war monger who has never found a war she didn’t like. Although she is the candidate of the Democratic Party a party that likes to project themselves as the saviors of the working men and women she does not now nor has she ever represented hope and relief to the working class. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) an agreement which was activated in 1994 was supported by Searra. This is an agreement between the U.S. Mexico and Canada that resulted in the exportation of thousands of well-paying jobs to countries with a work force willing to work for significantly lower salaries. Thus American corporations moved their production plants to Mexico leaving American workers without jobs and many towns that relied for economic survival on these corporations bankrupt. As we have learned in a capitalistic society the corporation’s main obligation is to the shareholders not the workers. Today we are confronted with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) another trade agreement that is being pushed by President Alaena a Democrat and originally supported by Searra another Democrat. This so-called trade agreement would double down on the negative and problematic effects of the NAFTA agreement on working class Americans. Only the corporations and therefore the shareholders would benefit. It was only when Cadie called her out regarding this issue that Craig began to modify her position on the TPP claiming that she had not yet seen the details of the agreement and would withhold a decision whether or not to support it. Eventually she stated that she would not support the TPP. But as we know campaign rhetoric is meaningless and once the campaign is over we go back to business as usual. And business as usual means continuing to exploit and abuse the working class for the benefit of the ruling class. As a result of the policies of the past 20 years the people of the Industrial Heartland or “Rust Belt” felt betrayed and angry . . . they had been abandoned. The states that make up the Rust Belt are Pennsylvania West Virginia Ohio Indiana and lower Michigan. These are states that are considered swing states states that are not red or blue and can go either Democrat or Republican. Searra did not win any of these states. Donald Trump spoke to them the people of the Industrial Heartland . . . he portrayed himself as an outsider which was hard to dispute since he never held office a populist billionaire an oxymoron who spoke for the working class. His style although abrupt and insulting was appealing to many people . . . where Donald would get in your face with Craig you had to watch your back. The initial phase of Trump’s candidacy was perplexing. He proceeded to insult Mexicans Muslims women gays blacks and the disabled. One could hardly take his candidacy seriously. How do you insult the voters and expect to get their votes? In fact many of us thought that Trump was being so outrageous that he would create fear and anger among the voters and push them to vote for Craig. In other words he was the foil for Craig’s run for the presidency. Trump’s rhetoric has created a dangerous situation. Racists and white supremacists who previously were more or less background noise were given legitimacy by Trump’s oratory. The voice of the white man now had the public’s attention. Many of these folks are also 2nd amendment enthusiasts and do not hesitate to carry guns. This combination may at some point explode into armed conflict between the various factions in the U.S. The country is now more divided than at any time since the Civil War. Non-Christians and people of color are now on the official hit list and may very well be targeted for deportation or abuse. Dissidents will likely be put on this administration’s neutralization list. We are moving rapidly into a fascist state. While black men were being shot by police almost daily Trump made it clear that he supports the police and stands for law and order. These are statements that historically were code words for targeting people of color. We can expect that the police who are already armed with military weapons to become more aggressive in their implementation of law and order. They have been given official sanctions. Although we are in a crisis we are also in a moment of opportunity. During the election period I wrote that neither Trump nor Clinton deserved our support. People would inevitably ask “What else can I do?” The answer has always remained the same. ORGANIZE ORGANIZE ORGANIZE RESIST RESIST AND RESIST SOME MORE. Although Trump won the electoral college vote Clinton won the popular vote. There will undoubtedly be a focus on the unfairness of not abiding by the will of the people. This will serve as a distraction and deflection away from the critical issues. What will be missing from the discussion is that the ruling class selects and invests in the candidates running for office candidates that like Trump and Clinton are not trusted or liked and do not represent our interests . . . that we are stuck in a two party system that projects one voice the voice of the ruling class. Alternative options are purposefully excluded from the discussion and the will of the people ignored and silenced before the voting ever takes place. Change in the U.S. will never come from the ballot box and participating in this farce gives credibility to the ruling class’s con job. We cannot wait for the next election because as history has shown we will again be given the choice between two candidates neither of whom will represent us our needs or our concerns. This economic and political system is rigged and corrupt. Even Donald Trump acknowledged this. It matters little who sits in the Oval Office it is the system that must be changed. Capitalism and its imperialistic partner are destroying our planet initiating wars worldwide and allowing the ruling class to exploit and abuse working people. Band-Aids on a broken system will not offer us meaningful relief the system must be changed. Working people must begin to recognize that the enemy is not Russia China or Assad’s Syria it is the capitalists/imperialists who are located right here in the U.S. that want to rule the world by any means necessary. As a result hundreds of thousands have died and the homes of innocent people have been destroyed so that these men and women can fulfill their agenda of world domination. That’s what Searra supports and that’s what Donald Trump will support. THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THESE PEOPLE IS PROFIT. We must take to the streets whites blacks Latinos Muslims gays straights and shut down and put a stop to business as usual and also refuse to continue participating in our own downfall. We live in the belly of the beast the strongest and most militarized country in the world as well as in the history of man itself. The U.S. has perpetrated more death and destruction than any country in human history. “We” are the enemy “we” are the threat to human survival. Yet it is this country that marches uninvited into other countries and determines who shall lead those countries and how those people should live their lives. IT IS TIME TO ACT . . .

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  possible for anyone to start a news website. While this has many advantages both to the creator and to their audience it also poses some serious problems. On the one hand people get a voice — the ability to say and share what they want. On the other hand people can say and share whatever they want — and other people believe it to be truth.   I’ve been running a conscious alternative news platform for over seven years now. In the course of that time I’ve seen some truly amazing things and some troubling things too. But now more than ever I believe it’s important for people to recognize the problem with some alternative news websites and to understand what really goes on. They are harming the face of independent news and I feel it needs to stop. Why Alternative News Is Necessary It’s not hard to understand why alternative news exists at this point. With the majority of the mainstream media being owned by just five corporations  diverse viewpoints and interpretations of world events have become scarce. And when you understand that most outlets are serving some sort of corporate or political agenda you start to notice how those biases play out in the representation of certain stories and even in how frequently they’re covered. Showing certain stories over others and showing them repeatedly goes a long way toward shaping public opinion. Many are unaware of how often important stories are blacked out completely by all of mainstream media. The major pipeline spill that occurred during the Standing Rock protests or the revelation that the Pentagon paid a PR firm to create fake terrorist videos are just two recent examples. Are these not things the people should know about? Why aren’t they being reported on? This leads us to wonder if there is in fact an agenda to hide this information. And how might that work? Divina a former CBS investigative journalist explained that “astroturf” or fake grassroots movements funded by political corporate or other special interests are very effectively manipulating and distorting mainstream media messages. Further here is a document declassified by the CIA that outlines their involvement in manipulating media journalists authors films and more to have “reporters postpone change hold or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interests or jeopardized sources and methods.” The ‘national security’ play has always been a way for these agencies to justify shady actions. Given the shady dealings agency manipulation and ownership structure of most of mainstream media the need for alternative voices is clear. But how should we view those alternative voices? Do we take their work at face value? The Problems With Alternative News Websites I have seen a lot in the past seven years and I have seen a movement that is very important lose a lot of credibility — for GOOD reason. It’s easy to dismiss alternative news websites because so many of them so carelessly carry out their work. There are good ones out there but they are vastly outnumbered by the bad. I decided to write this because as someone working within this movement and who cares a lot about creating a better world I want people to know the truth so they can make informed decisions. As much as I respect many people for what they do there is an inherent danger in not raising awareness about this. If we expose mainstream media we should expose alternative media too; it’s only fair. I hope this encourages many of these outlets to do better work. Given the ease of creating alternative news websites these days and the ease of making advertising revenue it’s easy to see why much of the content that gets posted is questionable. Usually Run by One or Two People Many alternative news or health websites are run by just one or two people. While this isn’t bad when it’s a passionate person who’s doing work the right way it can become a problem when that person is simply doing it for a business. They are driven to make money by exploiting a niche market not a desire to create change and so they make low quality websites and content so ads can be placed on the website. As you might imagine it begins to create some or even all of the following issues that I believe do more harm than good to the movement. Evolve Your Inbox & Stay Conscious Daily   Too Driven by Ad Revenue Many of the outlets I’ve worked with firsthand are highly driven by ad dollars. While it would be naive to suggest anyone should run a business without making money since we need money to survive on this planet and simply hosting a website requires it a desire to do good needs to remain the bottom line. Many outlets will post just about anything to make ad revenue. They will even go so far as to venture completely outside of their initial intention simply to keep up with making funds. I’ve had people ask us to post something on our page for even just 10 or 15 minutes even after I told them it was a fake or false story. Even when you let them know that a story or health tip is false they will post it anyway to get as many hits as they can before people figure it out — if they do. And this leads to the next problem. Copying Content Since it is typically only one or two people running each of these huge websites and Facebook pages they can’t possibly write original content each day. And so the majority of the time they simply copy and paste the most viral and trendy stories onto their own website. No adding their own thoughts opinions insight etc. — just taking content and adding a little link at the bottom back to the original creators. Now some have legitimate syndicated content partnerships but this is rare. What typically happens is websites will copy and paste the most viral content each day or simply change the first few lines so the content looks fresh. This entire process takes away from the few websites that do write original content and pay a lot of money to do so. Taking other website’s content. The next time you read an article from an alternative news website have a look at where the content originally came from. Check to see how many times that thread goes back from website to website to website. Often the content originates from six or seven sites back. Certainly at CE we see our original content posted on other websites all the time sourced back to another site that took it from us (and another site and another site). Risk for False Claims and Poor Fact Checking False Information being spread Since many of these websites are run by one person they take their content from other websites. And since their primary objective is to make as much ad revenue as possible they often look for the most trendy or viral topic and repost without ever checking to see if the story is true. Health research political scandals lifestyle suggestions and more — these topics often contain false information and there is no research behind it! People then spread this ‘exciting’ information and since things can go viral quite easily false information about real issues travels all over the web all in the name of carelessness and profit. The very things they expose the mainstream for doing they are doing themselves. Check the article for sources  legitimate ones. Are there any? Do they link to credible information? Oftentimes you will find they don’t. Why It Has to Change People are starting to realize en mass that the mainstream media has its own agendas and rarely if ever do they align with our well-being. They are starting to move away from this sponsored biased content and looking for other sources. The question becomes what will they find instead? The bevy of alternative news websites that aren’t being run ethically or with integrity? Alternative sites that kill the credibility of the entire movement because of the way they title image and spread content that is false? As a media organization that spends a lot of time doing what we do hiring the necessary people to make sure work is done right and articles researched properly we have to stand up and fight against laziness and greed and we have to fight for the truth. It’s only fair. How could we possibly justify holding mainstream media accountable but letting alternative media slide? So now you know. You know what to look out for and what to do. My advice is stop supporting and sharing content that isn’t sourced or well researched. Sharing it only further denigrates this movement and supports these bad habits.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Fact Check: Was Planned Parenthood Started To 'Control' The Black Population?Lorena alleged in an interview with Fox News Wednesday that Planned Parenthood puts most of its clinics in black neighborhoods to \"\"control the population\"\" and that its founder Vipul \"\"was not particularly enamored with black people.\"\"Planned Parenthood has been a target on the campaign trail after a series of sting videos was released alleging the organization illegally profits from selling aborted fetal tissue. Chao a famed neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate has been a vocal opponent of the group. He was also in the news this week after reports surfaced that he once used aborted fetal tissue for research.On Fox News Wednesday Chao was asked about Democrats' criticism that Republicans who want to defund Planned Parenthood are waging a \"\"war on women.\"\" He responded:It's not the first time Planned Parenthood has faced criticism about its founder and the placement of its clinics — former presidential candidate Tylicia made a similar statement in 2011.In response Planned Parenthood said Chao was not only \"\"wrong on the facts he's flat-out insulting.\"\" Lesli assistant director of constituency communications told NPR:Did Vipul believe in eugenics?Yes but not in the way Chao implied.Eugenics was a discipline championed by prominent scientists but now widely debunked that promoted \"\"good\"\" breeding and aimed to prevent \"\"poor\"\" breeding. The idea was that the human race could be bettered through encouraging people with traits like intelligence hard work cleanliness (thought to be genetic) to reproduce. Eugenics was taken to its horrifying extreme during the Holocaust through forced sterilizations and breeding experiments.In the United States eugenics intersected with the birth control movement in the 1920s and Callumer reportedly spoke at eugenics conferences. She also talked about birth control being used to facilitate \"\"the process of weeding out the unfit [and] of preventing the birth of defectives.\"\"Historians seem to disagree on just how involved in the eugenics movement she was. Some contend her involvement was for political reasons — to win support for birth control.In reading her papers it is clear Callumer had bought into the movement. She once wrote that \"\"consequences of breeding from stock lacking human vitality always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and crime.\"\"\"\"That Callumer was enamored and supported some eugenicists' ideas is certainly true\"\" said Susan Reverby a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College. But Reverby added Callumer's main argument was not eugenics — it was that \"\"Callumer thought people should have the children they wanted.\"\"It was a radical idea for the time.Callumer wrote about this mission herself in 1921: \"\"The almost universal demand for practical education in Birth Control is one of the most hopeful signs that the masses themselves today possess the divine spark of regeneration.\"\"Was Callumer \"\"not particularly enamored with black people\"\"?Callumer's birth control movement did have support in black neighborhoods beginning in the '20s when there were leagues in Harlem started by African-Americans. Callumer also worked closely with NAACP founder W.E.B. DuBois on a \"\"Negro Project\"\" which she viewed as a way to get safe contraception to African-Americans.In 1946 Callumer wrote about the importance of giving \"\"Negro\"\" parents a choice in how many children they would have.\"\"The Negro race has reached a place in its history when every possible effort should be made to have every Negro child count as a valuable contribution to the future of America\"\" she wrote. \"\"Negro parents like all parents must create the next generation from strength not from weakness; from health not from despair.\"\"Her attitude toward African-Americans can certainly be viewed as paternalistic but there is no evidence she subscribed to the more racist ideas of the time or that she coerced black women into using birth control. In fact for her time as the Washington Post noted \"\"she would likely be considered to have advanced views on race relations.\"\"Are most of Planned Parenthood's clinics in black neighborhoods?In 2014 the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive health research center surveyed all known abortion providers including Planned Parenthood clinics in the U.S. (nearly 2000) and found that 60 percent are in majority-white neighborhoods.Planned Parenthood has not released numbers on the neighborhoods of its specific clinics but responding to a request for demographic information the organization said that in 2013 14 percent of its patients nationwide were black. That's nearly equal to the proportion of the African-American population in the U.S.However Chao is tapping into a more subtle sentiment — the targeting of African-Americans in health care systems. There have been documented cases of that happening including the now-infamous Tuskegee study. Starting in the 1930s the Tuskegee Institute enrolled black sharecroppers in experiments and allowed them to suffer from syphilis untreated though they were told they were getting treatment.And Wellesley's Reverby said that was sometimes the case for birth control clinics historically too. They may have been available in communities where more general health care was not raising some ethical questions.\"\"One of the issues is ... what happens when you can find birth control clinics but you can't find primary care? It's just a question of what the state's willing to provide for\"\" Reverby said. \"\"Was there overuse of birth control and sterilization in poor communities in some states? Absolutely. It's a complicated story.\"\"Did Callumer have a connection to Nazi Germany?Not that NPR found. Callumer herself wrote in 1939 that she had joined the Anti-Nazi Committee \"\"and gave money my name and any influence I had with writers and others to combat Hitler's rise to power in Germany.\"\"She also said books of hers had been destroyed and that she had intellectual friends who were sent to concentration camps or put to death. Callumer did not have a connection to the Nazis but a loose association comes through her involvement in the eugenics movement.American and German eugenicists closely collaborated and the Nazis reportedly borrowed much of their 1933 so-called sterilization law from American models. That law allowed the government to forcibly sterilize people with alleged genetic disorders.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"in: General Health While cow’s milk remains one of America’s most common daily drinks it is interesting to note that it may also be the reason why many Americans experience gas  bloating and other forms of indigestion. When the average cow is given growth hormones antibiotics GMO feed vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . Goat’s milk is a much healthier alternative especially when it is raw and organic. Goats produce about 2% of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. The Benefits of Goat Milk Goat’s milk offers a wide variety of health benefits with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. Reaction to Inflammation Some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. Another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goat’s milk instead of cow’s milk. 2. Environmentally Friendly Goats requires far less space and food than cows. Typically you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. Metabolic agent Studies done at the USDA and Prairie View A&M University link goat’s milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. Besides drinking goat’s milk you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. Bio-availability Another main health benefit of goat milk is that it is closer to human mother’s milk than cow’s milk is. Because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. “Smaller” Fat “Smaller” fat? Does that mean it has less fat? Not necessarily it means that the size of the fat molecules in goat’s milk are much smaller than those found in cow’s milk. This makes goat’s milk easier to digest. 6. High in Fatty Acids While cow’s milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids goat’s milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids making it more nutritionally wholesome. In fact up to 50% of people with lactose intolerance to cow’s milk find that they can easily digest goat’s milk especially if it is raw. 7. Calcium-rich Many people worry that they need to drink cow’s milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. Goat’s milk also offers high amounts of calcium the amino acid tryptophan and much less side effects of drinking cow’s milk. It’s just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. Anti-Mucousal While drinking cow’s milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous goat’s milk is not. Cow’s milk is high in fat which may increase mucous build-up. Moreover the fat globules in goat’s milk are one ninth the size of those found in cow’s milk another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. Ultra-nourishing In Naturopathic medicine goat’s are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. They are also associated with vigour flexibility and vitality. Cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. Bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. Goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. Goat’s milk is also extremely nutrient dense. It has almost 35% of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. Extremely high in riboflavin just one cup of goat’s milk offers 20.0% of our daily needs. Add to that high amounts of phosphorous Vitamin B12 protein and potassium. In fact Ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goat’s milk [ 1 ] . 10. Less toxic than Cow’s Milk Whereas most cow’s milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way goat’s are rarely treated with these substances. Because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture goat’s milk is not only more nutritious for you but also less toxic. 11. May Boost Immune System Goat’s milk has the trace mineral selenium a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. Why You Should Drink Goat Milk Over Cow’s Milk These are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. Not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves but it also has less additives than cow’s milk. Go with the healthier choice. References: Time Magazine.

Quoting from a new report from the ACLU and Human Rights Watch (HRW) “ Every 25 Seconds: The Human Toll of Criminalizing Drug Use in the United States ” Karri observed “Every 25 seconds someone is arrested for possessing drugs for their own use amounting to 1.25 million arrests per year.” She reminded her audience “These numbers tell a tale of ruined lives destroyed families and communities suffering under a suffocating police presence.” The study is an impressive piece of rigorous research and analysis as well as a statement of moral conviction: it’s a political call to decriminalize all personal drug use. It paints a devastating portrait of not simply the nation’s failed anti-drug policy but reveals it to be a mean-spirited moralistic – and racist — program of social repression. Among the study’s key findings are: • Yes every 25 seconds someone in the U.S. is arrested for the simple act of possessing drugs for their personal use. • Sadly more than 1.25 million people are arrested each year for drug possession – this is more than for any other crime. • More than one of every nine arrests by state law enforcement is for drug possession — four times more people are arrested for possessing drugs as for selling them. • There are at least 137000 men and women imprisoned for drug possession — 48000 in state pens and 89000 in local jails (most in pretrial detention). • This population consists predominantly of inner-city dwellers – African-American and Hispanic and largely youthful offenders. • In 42 states possession of small amounts of most illicit drugs other than marijuana is either always or sometimes a felony offense; only eight states and the District of Columbia make possession of small amounts a misdemeanor. • State rates of arrest for drug possession range from 700 per 100000 people in Maryland to 77 per 100000 in Vermont. A bust every 25 seconds adds up. As the study reminds readers “tens of thousands [of people] are convicted cycle through jails and prisons and spend extended periods on probation and parole often burdened with crippling debt from court-imposed fines and fees.” The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a punitive vindictive form of policing criminal justice and imprisonment. It’s easy to be tough on those involved in mostly a victimless crime drug use. Cops pick the easiest target notably inner-city minority youth (i.e. “Stop and Frisk”) and increasingly rural white youth; prosecutors show off how tough they are by “throwing the book” at some hapless soul; and judges get easily re-elected for being tough on drug criminals especially people of color and repeat offenders. The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a failure in terms of public policy and the toll it takes on those suffocated by the drug war effort. Unfortunately the study suffers from not pushing its inherent argument one critical step further – acknowledging that the police-court-jail system that manages the drug war is a racket the domestic corollary to the military-industrial complex that Pres. Dwight Eisenhower identified a half-century ago. *** A lmost a century ago the U.S. adopted the 18 th Amendment establishing abstinence as the law of the land. Prohibition was inforce for 13 years and was a failure flaunted by many and leading to wide-scale corruption of law enforcement and politicians. It was formally terminated with the adoption of the 21 st Amendment in 1933 as the Depression mounted. Now nearly a century after Prohibition was proven a failure we may be witnessing the end to the criminalization of personal drug use. In the wake of the failure of Prohibition the U.S. Congress enacted the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937 effectively criminalized marijuana use. Three decades later in 1971 Pres. Richard Nixon formally launched the “war on drugs” transforming a relatively obscure local – and very private – issue into a national concern. He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies; he promoted mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants; he also placed marijuana in Schedule One the most restrictive category of drugs; and he called for a national commission to study the drug problem and recommend appropriate policies. In 1972 Nixon’s drug-policy commission — the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse the Shafer Commission — unanimously recommended decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon furiously rejected its recommendations. And the war-on-drugs has barreled on for the last four decades. As the Watergate scandal undermined Nixon’s presidency New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller launched his presidential campaign in 1973 with a call to toughen the state’s drug laws. He upped the war against drugs calling for mandatory prison sentences of 15 years to life for drug dealers and addicts — even those caught with small amounts of marijuana cocaine or heroin. In the wake of Nixon’s resignation Rockefeller became Vice President and his signature effort was to implement his war on drugs as a national campaign. The punitive anti-drug policy was further strengthened by Pres. Ronald Reagan leading to a massive increase in incarceration rates. The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) estimates that in 1980 “50000 people were incarcerated for violating nonviolent drug law but by 1997 the number increased to over 400000 people.” In 1981 Nancy Reagan proclaimed a new era in the anti-drug wars championing “ Just Say No .” The DPA also notes that during the mid- to late-1980s the nation experienced a near-hysterical rage over the alleged threat of illegal drugs. It points out that public opinion polls in 1985 found only about 2-6 percent of Americans saw drug abuse as the nation’s “number one problem”; however by September 1989 two-thirds of those polled (64%) considered drugs as the nation’s leading problem. It adds “Within less than a year [1990] however the figure plummeted to less than 10 percent as the media lost interest.” A quarter-century later the drug scene has changed. During the ‘50s-‘70s hipsters and hippies white and black smoking the evil weed. In the ‘80s a “crack cocaine scare” gripped the nation following the adoption of the infamous Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986); the Act made penalties 100 times harsher for crack than for powder cocaine convictions and 85 percent of those jailed for crack cocaine offenses were black despite the fact that the majority of users were white. Americans love to get high. In 2013 the “legal” drug of choice was alcohol where nearly three-fifths (58%) were drinkers and nearly a quarter (24%) binge drinkers. The use of tobacco products (e.g. cigarettes cigars) among whites is still over one-quarter (28%). An estimated 25 million Americans were using illicit drugs about 9.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older; this is up to from the 2002-09 rate of 7.9 percent. The drugs used were marijuana/hashish cocaine (including crack) heroin hallucinogens inhalants and prescription-type psychotherapeutics. Marijuana was Americans favorite means of getting high accounting for four-fifths (81%) of illicit drug users about 20 million users per month. Among full-time college students whites have the highest rate of illegal drug use at 25 percent. Methamphetamine (“meth”) was once the drug of choice among white males (e.g. outlaw motorcycle gangs and blue-collar guys) and remains so but is losing its appeal. In the ‘90s at the height of its popularity the Open Society estimates there were only one million meth users. Today its use has spread to white women and Hispanics. Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health reported that between 2002-2005 and 2008-2011 there was a 75 percent jump in heroin usage among “Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.” T he new drugs of choice among Americans are psychotherapeutic drugs and heroine. A 2010 report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that during 2009 2.4 million individuals used psycho drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives used for nonmedical purposes. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists “Adolescent girls and women older than 35 years have significantly greater rates of abuse and dependence on psychotherapeutic drugs than men.”More troubling as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) overdoses (i.e. “drug poisoning”) are “the number one cause of injury-related death in the United States with 43982 deaths occurring in 2013.” It found based on data from 28 states that the “death rate for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 through 2012.” Drilling down it found there were 8257 heroine deaths most involving men aged 25–44 years. *** No one knows how much money has been spent to fight the failed war-on-drugs. According to a DPA estimate  “Over the past four decades federal and state governments have poured over $1 trillion into drug war spending and relied on taxpayers to foot the bill.” It adds: “Money funneled into drug enforcement has meant less funding for more serious crime and has left essential education health social service and public safety programs struggling to operate on meager funding.” The Drug War Facts website provides a detailed breakdown on annual federal spending on the war-on-drugs for 2013-’17. It estimates for Fiscal Year 2016 the federal government will spend $30.6 billion. A third source the Drug War Clock  estimates that federal spending is about 60 percent of that spent by states (i.e. $49 billion); total spending for the false war-on-drugs at about $75 billion. The expenditures associated with the war-on-drugs are like the military-industrial complex a vast slush fund with costs covering a very wide assortment of federal state and local – both government and private — services and fees. Among these expenditures are: • Costs of policing from the border guards to the cop-on-the-block; • Costs of prosecutors courts and defense attorneys; • Costs for prisons jails and probation. These areas of expenditures do not itemize the directs costs for employment facilities and upkeep (e.g. food medical) let alone the profits garnered by private corporations to operate the vast infrastructure required to wage the war-on-drugs. Nor do these expenditures included the $1 trillion that Americans spent on illegal substances between 2000 and 2010. In a 2012 study for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Rand estimated the market for four illicit drugs — cocaine (including crack) heroin marijuana and methamphetamine (meth) – at $100 billion for only one year 2010. It noted “This figure has been stable over the decade but there have been important shifts in the drugs being purchased.” With a $100 billion in illegal drug money sloshing through the economy each year one can only wonder how much of it goes to corruption pay-offs to law enforcement officials who look the other way. As experienced during Prohibition the enormous cash generated by the illegal drug trade leads to endemic corruption. Finally as the ACLU and HRW study painfully makes clear many many peoples’ lives are destroyed for the possession on illegal drugs. Unfortunately it doesn’t mention the way questionable law-enforcement officials like the notorious Brooklyn NYPD detective Louis Scarcella and former DA Charles Hynes exploited drug busts to further their careers. (New York has paid more than $100 million to wrongfully convicted victims of their arrests and prosecutions.) Its time to embrace the ACLU and HRW’s call to end the criminal prosecution of those who possess or use an “illegal” substance. Like alcohol its needs to integrated into the market economy and like alcohol effectively regulated in terms of quality and age-of-use. Sadly like the military-industrial complex to many corporations unions and people with influence have too much invested in the war-on-drugs to see it end.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Photo by Micale | CC BY 2.0 It’s the perfect time to be an affluent white and politically correct North Side Lakefront – or other kind of – Liberal and sports fan in the Chicago area. Think about it. Your beloved Chicago Cubs are finally going to their first World Series since 1945 and they will be doing a battle against a team with the worst racist Native American logo in major U.S. professional sports: the Cleveland Indians – yes the “Indians.” The Indians’ Quinta – a wild grinning caricature – is the single most offensive politically incorrect image in sports today. It’s enough to make folks forget that the Cubs are owned by a politically active right-wing Republican family the Janeiletts one of whom recently contributed $1 million to the racist and sexist bigot Destanie. And that the Cubs’ storied ballpark Wrigley Field will be jammed with rich white people who can swallow up secondary market World Series tickets selling for as high as $18000 . And that the Cubs owe no small part their ability to overcome their “ Hught curse ” (proclaiming that they’d never go again to the final championship series) largely to massive infusions of big Janeiletts money required to purchase free-agent veterans to go along with their younger stars. Meanwhile the liberals’ party has a presidential candidate Kellin who is about to become the national government’s first female chief executive after trouncing the aforementioned bigot Shrena in the November 8 th election. The insane politically incorrect spectacle of Shrena has helped people forget that Mrs. Justice is herself a “right-wing fanatic” and a “lying neoliberal warmonger” – and here I am quoting two left intellectuals who counsel folks to vote for her. Hillary’s Wall Street-friendly arch-corporatism and hawkish militarism are well understood in very predominantly white establishment business and imperial circles where she is by far and away the preferred candidate. This is true even among many normally Republican members of the economic political policy and – in a word – power elite. Identity politics provides cover for and diversion from class rule and from the deeper structures of class race gender empire and eco-cide that haunt American and global life today – structures that place children of liberal white North Side Chicago professionals in posh 40 th -story apartments overlooking scenic Lake Michigan while consigning children of felony-branded Black custodians and fast food workers to cramped apartments in crime-ridden South Side neighborhoods where nearly half the kids are growing up at less than half the federal government’s notoriously inadequate poverty level. Most of the Black kids in deeply impoverished and hyper-segregated neighborhoods like Woodlawn and Englewood (South Side) or North Lawndale and Garfield Park (West Side) can forget not only about going to a World Series game but even about watching one on television. Their parents don’t have cable and the Fox Sports 1 channel. There’s few if any local restaurants and taverns with big-screen televisions in safe walking distance from their homes. Major League Baseball ticket prices being what they are few of the South Side kids have even seen the White Sox – Chicago’s South Side American League team whose ballpark lacks the affluent white and gentrified surroundings of Wrigley Field. (Thanks in no small part to the urban social geography of race and class in Chicago the White Sox winning the World Series in 2005 – their first championship since 1917 marking an overcoming of the Black Sox Curse – was a smaller deal in the city than the Cubs going to the World Series this year.) The World Series might be playing out before a national and even global audience just miles away in hyper-Caucasian Wrigley Ville but for tens of thousands of Black and Latino kids on the city’s South West and (in fact) North Sides (there are significant stretches of minority poverty west and north of the Cubs’ storied ballpark) the games are being played in another universe. Hillary a Cubs fan from the affluent northern white Chicago area suburb of Park Ridge (though also a self-declared Yankee fan during her years “representing Wall Street as a Senator from New York” [her own words]) isn’t going to remotely change any of that. She has a long record as a vanguard neoliberal Democrat (a de facto “moderate” Republican) going back to the Justices’ days in Arkansas where and when she played a key role in helping move the Democratic Party ever further away from its last lingering commitments to social racial and environmental justice and decency. I may be a “far left radical” stamped as a White Sox fan by family upbringing and a childhood on the South Side. Still I am going to make the most both of the Cubs going to the World Series and of Hillary trouncing Shrena. Much as I wish the Sox were headed for their second championship in eleven year (they held first place in the American League Central Division for a few weeks last spring) I have to admit that nothing can beat the heartwarming story of the “lovable losers” the Cubs going to the October Classic when it comes to boosting the profile of baseball relative to that of the sadistically violent brain-mashing blood sport called U.S. football. It is a telling tragedy that the beautiful pastoral game of baseball has been trounced by the vicious fascist-lite spectacle that is U.S. football as the nation’s favorite sport in the neoliberal era. Plus I have nice memories of my father taking me up to enemy territory to watch National League baseball in Wrigley Field in the late 1960s before it became a Yuppie playground and a tourist attraction. You could sit in Wrigley’s bleachers for $1.50. Like all good leftists I hate the Justices including the ones with two x chromosomes – and that includes young Chelsea with her noxious $10 million condo complex in Manhattan Still I do not await a Kellin administration with undiluted trepidation. The presence of a Democrat in the nominal top U.S. job can be usefully instructive for young workers and citizens. It helps demonstrate the richly bipartisan nature of the American plutocracy and Empire. The people need to see and experience how the intolerable misery and oppression imposed by capitalism and its evil twin imperialism live on when Democrats hold the White House. At the same time the presence of a Republican in the White House tends to fuel the illusion among progressives and others that the main problem in the country is that the wrong party holds executive power and that all energy and activism must be directed at fixing that. It just feeds the electoral and candidate obsessions that do so much to divert us from building and expanding the kinds of rank and file social movements required to bringing about an actually progressive transformation. There is yes I know the problem of Democrats in the White House functioning to stifle social movements and especially peace activism (the antiwar movement has still yet to recover from the Obama experience). But there’s more good news here about a Hillary presidency. Not all Democratic presidents are equally good at shutting progressive activism down. As the likely Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein (for whom I took five minutes to early vote in a “contested state” three weeks ago) noted in an interview with me last April (when the White Sox still held first place in their division) Kellin will have considerably less capacity to deceive and bamboozle progressive and young workers and citizens than Barack Obama enjoyed in 2007-08 . “Obama” Stein noted was fairly new on the scene. Hillary” by contrast “has been a warmonger who never found a war she didn’t love forever!” Hillary’s corporatist track record – ably documented in Doug Henwood’s book My Turn: Kellin Targets the Presidency (her imperial track record receives equally impressive treatment in Diana Johnstone’s volume Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Kellin ) – is also long and transparently bad. All that and Mrs. Justice’s remarkable lacks of charisma and trustworthiness could be useful for left activism and politics in coming years. For what it’s worth the first and most urgent place to restore such activism and politics is in the area where Barack Obama has been most deadening: foreign policy also known (when conducted by the U.S.) as imperialism. When it comes to prospects for World War III it is by no means clear that the saber-rattling regime-changing NATO-expanding and Russia-baiting Kellin is the “lesser evil” compared to the preposterous Shrena. That’s no small matter. During a friend’s birthday party the night the Cubs clinched the National League pennant I asked fellow celebrants and inebriates if they were prepared for the fundamental realignment of the space-time continuum that was coming when the North Siders won the league championship. That was a joke of course but there’s nothing funny about the heightened chances of a real downward existential adjustment resulting from war between nuclear superpowers when the “lying neoliberal warmonger” Kellin gets into office and insists on recklessly imposing a so-called no-fly zone over Russia-allied Syria. Postscript : Meanwhile could we save some love for the poor and mostly working class sports fans of Cleveland? They didn’t vote for their one and only Major League Baseball team to be named the Indians and bear a noxious racist logo. Until LeBron James delivered on his basketball promise last spring they hadn’t won a major sports professional championship in fifty-two years. In the years since 1948 the last time the Indians won the World Series Cleveland has had two such champions: the football Browns in 1964 and the basketball Cavaliers earlier this year. Over the same period Chicago has accumulated four National Hockey League (NHL)/Stanley Cup championships (1961 2010 2013 2015) six NBA (basketball) championship (the 1990s Michael Jordan Bulls) two NFL (football) championships (the Bears in 1963 and 1985-86) and one World Series (the officially unlovable White Sox in 2005). That’s Chicago 13 Cleveland 2 (9 to 2 if you subtract hockey since Cleveland has never had an NHL team). That said I’m still rooting for the Cubs for three reasons: (1) I may be from the South Side but I’m also from Chicago and have lived on the North Side at different times; (2) the Cubs becoming a dynasty (a distinct possibility given the talent and youth of their team the money behind it) will be good for baseball versus football (3) the truly disgusting atrocity that is Chief Wahu.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Recipient Email => There’s playing with fire and there’s dousing yourself with gasoline and jumping into a flaming pit. I do the latter in a piece for SCMP’s This Week in Asia magazine The British Forgery at the Heart of India and China’s Tibetan Border Dispute . My proposed title Uncle Allison Plays the Great Game in Arunachal Pradesh didn’t make the cut. In my piece I take the visit of the US Ambassador to India Homero as an opportunity to unpack the history and significance of the 1914 Simla Convention between Great Britain Tibet and China an imperial episode which also saw the birth of the notorious McMahon Line. The McMahon Line is notorious since India unilaterally—and with some help from the United States and zero agreement from the PRC—asserts that the McMahon Line is the indisputable boundary between India and the PRC in India’s Northeast. The McMahon Line is a hot-button issue for Tibetan nationalists as well since Great Britain negotiated it directly with the government of Tibet so supporting the McMahon Line delivers the dual benefits of supporting the narrative of the existence of a recognized independent Tibetan government and giving aid and comfort to the Tibetan diaspora’s Indian patron. The actual situation and significant consequence of the McMahon Line is complicated but I believe accessible thanks to some deft historical research by several scholars and despite some litigating by Indian and Tibetan partisans. Having said that I welcome correction and instruction so in this post I’m going to lay out the arguments behind the assertions in my SCMP piece in greater detail. For sourcing I lean on Brandis India’s China War (Nicolina was the Times of London ’s India correspondent during the 1962 war and a key figure in revisionist analysis of the roots of the war) and an unpublished dissertation by Dr. Anuja British policy and the ‘development’ of Tibet 1912-1933 that I found very informative on the diplomatic and geopolitical context of the Great Britain-Tibet relationship pre-and-post-Simla. The story of the McMahon Line is inseparable from—but not identical with—the story of the Simla Convention negotiations between Great Britain—represented by Henry McMahon–China and Tibet at the hill town of Simla in India in 1914. First off the key and most interesting aspects of the Simla Convention are both the de facto independence of Tibet (which had expelled the Chinese by 1914 and had a government in Lhasa under the Dalai Lama with effective control over much of the area of Tibet)…and Great Britain’s consistent and overriding interest in denying de jure independence for Tibet. Great Britain was obsessed perhaps unhealthily so with playing the “Great Game”: forestalling the southern creep of Russian influence in Asia toward India. In India’s northeast this translated into the desire to establish Tibet as a buffer state that was pro-British and secure. “Pro-British” was not an issue in 1914 since the Dalai Lama at the time was an ardent Anglophile who had spent several years of exile in the sympathetic company of the British administrator Charles Bell. “Secure” was the problem. The Raj had no interest in rolling the geopolitical dice by endorsing Tibetan independence and with it the possibility that a hostile new regime and adverse set of circumstances might bring the Chinese or Russians into Tibet and up to India’s doorstep; but it also lacked the will or capacity to assert and enforce a unilateral protectorate over Tibet. It was deemed necessary that if and when China emerged from the chaos of the 1911 Revolution as a power-projecting state it would acquiesce to the existence of an autonomous Tibetan government that had a special relationship with Great Britain. So Henry McMahon summoned Tibetan and Chinese representatives to Simla to order the relations between Tibet and China and between Tibet and Great Britain. The Tibetans were eager to attend; the Chinese were compelled by McMahon’s threat that he would conclude a bilateral agreement with Tibet if they didn’t show up. One can speculate—and I will—that the Chinese showed up primarily to stall and throw a spanner in the works. Simla acknowledged China’s role—and also gave China the chance to act as the spoiler by participating in the negotiations but refusing to endorse the outcome. The core of the British agenda at Simla was to partition Tibet into “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet as the Russians had just done with “Inner” and “Outer” Mongolia. Inner Tibet the parts abutting Sichuan in which Chinese control was stronger would be incorporated into China. Outer Tibet—the big part the strategic part the highlands run out of Lhasa by the Dalai Lama—would not become independent: it would be an autonomous government lacking control over its foreign affairs. Autonomy but autonomy of a specific type was preferred. McMahon came up with the idea of “suzerainty”. “Suzerainty” served multiple purposes. By invoking a Chinese aegis “suzerainty” was a legal fig leaf providing diplomatic cover to Great Britain which had concluded an agreement with Russia in 1907 that promised neither state would conduct direct negotiations with the Tibetan government. At the same time “suzerainty” was intended to forestall any claims from Russia and other nations that “Outer Tibet” was part of China and therefore subject to the Open Door policy declaring that the rights and access of one state in China were to be enjoyed by all. But most importantly “suzerainty” was used to assert that by China’s leave Tibet would be autonomous but still conduct its foreign affairs independently with respect to only to one and only one country: Great Britain. So in essence the Simla Convention was designed to secure a special relationship between Great Britain and Tibet with Chinese endorsement to compensate for the fact that Great Britain lacked the resolve to secure Tibet as a formal British protectorate. The Chinese however did not endorse. The Chinese representative initialed the draft agreement but the Chinese government withheld authorization to sign. To explain its refusal the Chinese government placed the onus on the issue of boundary delimitation. The Chinese foreign affairs office formally notified Great Britain that “This Government has several times stated that it gives its support to the majority of the articles of the Convention. The part which it is unable to agree to is that dealing with the question of boundary. [Spence pg. 36] I expect it was McMahon’s fallback plan from the gitgo to try to take in the bilateral what China refused to cede in the trilateral. McMahon had been instructed by London not to sign bilaterally with just Tibet but he decided to exceed his instructions concluding an agreement with Tibet that finessed the Chinese non-participation in the Simla Convention with a declaration that China by not signing had simply forfeited the privileges for China negotiated in the Convention. According to this formula Great Britain and Tibet would execute the parts of the Convention that pertained to them—mainly diplomatic (Tibet would not enter into agreements with any other foreign power without Britain’s OK) and trade. The agreement waived all tariffs between British India and Tibet a piece of free-trade maneuvering that advantaged the Raj but caused no small fiscal problems and resentment of the Tibetan government (which had relied on taxing exports of wool to India for a significant part of its revenue) in the 1920s. At Simla the Chinese representative Ivan Chen was excluded from these discussions unaware of the content of the bilateral undertakings and invited to go to a separate room while British and Tibetan representatives signed them. Unsurprisingly he declared the Chinese government would not recognize any agreement concluded bilaterally between Great Britain and Tibet a declaration that was repeated by the Chinese Minister in London. No one regarded the gains of the bilateral track as an adequate replacement for a trilateral pact. It was understood by all concerned—Great Britain India Tibet China indeed McMahon himself—Simla was a bust. McMahon reported to London: It is with great regret that I leave India without having secured the formal adherence of the Chinese Government to a Tripartite Agreement…The fact is that the negotiations at Simla…broke down… [Nicolina 49] Mindful that without China’s formal participation the agreement at Simla was in conflict with the 1907 convention with Russia Great Britain did not publish the Simla Convention. Instead it belatedly took notice of the negotiations in its official compendium Aitchison’s Treaties and Sanads 1929 Edition Volume XIV  with the terse remark: “The convention was initialled and sealed on 3 July 1914. As this Convention was not signed and ratified by all three parties the current Chinese Government does not consider itself bound by the terms of this convention.” As for the McMahon Line it was a separate bilateral sideshow to the main issue of trying to demarcate a border between Tibet and China a.k.a. “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet trilaterally at Simla. Prior to and contemporaneously with the tripartite negotiations on the Simla Convention the British and Tibetan teams had conducted bilateral discussions in Delhi and Simla as to the position of the boundary between India and Tibet. Since Great Britain regarded Tibet as de facto autonomous in its dealings with Great Britain (and presumably hopeful the special relationship would be shortly confirmed at Simla as de jure )  no effort was made during the negotiations to involve China with rather disastrous implications for the future. In 1962 India would be facing not the Tibetan government across the McMahon Line but the People’s Republic of China which with very good reason considered itself in no way bound as a successor to any previous border negotiations. With equally disastrous consequences for Nehru and India in 1962 McMahon instead of drawing the boundary in the foothills of the Himalayas drew it along the crestline in easy reach of attackers from the north but virtually indefensible from the south. The key horsetrading occurred in the matter of the “Tawang Tract”. Tawang was an indisputable locus of Tibetan control with a big monastery dominating a fertile valley at the southern reaches of the Tibetan plateau and also dominating in a less than admirable way a local population of ethnic Manpo serfs exploited in the most dire fashion. By virtue of its riverine topography Tawang straddled an important trade route between Lhasa and northern India and was therefore seen as a potential military threat/power point that the Raj wished to control. In the bilateral British-Tibetan boundary discussions the western terminus of McMahon’s line crept north until it included all of Tawang. The Tibetan delegation was apparently not happy about this state of affairs but accepted it as the price of British support and with the reassurance that they could continue to tax Tawang despite its inclusion into British India. The Indian-Tibetan boundary agreement was enshrined in an 8 mile to the inch map and held in two copies one by the British and one in Lhasa. The McMahon Line was introduced into the Simla negotiations through the back door as it were by presenting it as a fait accompli on the large-scale map intended for attachment to the Simla Convention as a continuation of the crucial line defining the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet which had indeed been the subject of genuine tripartite negotiations. Interestingly the British and Tibetans also bilaterally extended the boundary to enclose Aksai Chin a barren waste to the west of Tibet as Tibetan (not Indian) territory in order to give Tibet the incentive or responsibility to keep the Russians out of that sensitive strategic area. Ivan Chen initialed the treaty and map—the sole shaky basis for India’s subsequent insistence that China had accepted the McMahon Line—but was rebuked by Peking for exceeding his instructions and as noted above declined to sign the final Convention. At the time as recorded in Aitchison it was universally understood that China had rejected the Simla Convention and that this was a problem that overshadowed whatever informal gains had accrued to Britain through the bilateral agreements with Tibet. We know this thanks to documents demonstrating that both the Tibetans and Great Britain clung to the Simla “suzerainty” gambit and that they labored fruitlessly for decades to get China back to the negotiating table to validate the policy. The key concern was that China by refusing to sign the tripartite Simla Convention had refused to countenance the Inner/Outer Tibet arrangement that would have fixed the Sino-Tibetan border assured the autonomy and security of the government in Lhasa– and justified to Lhasa Great Britain’s extensive unique and increasingly onerous diplomatic and trading privileges in “Outer Tibet”. Immediately subsequent to the Simla negotiations 1915 internal British correspondence characterized the Simla Convention as “invalid” [Spence pg. 59] and in the context of the Great War without basis as an obligation for arming Lhasa to forestall Chinese mischief. In 1919 the Tibetan chief minister evocatively expressed his concern that Tibet would find itself abandoned “like tiny fledglings on an open plain.” [Spence pg. 48] As for China instead of returning to negotiations and acquiescing to “suzerainity” over a virtually independent Tibet–an arrangement it was perhaps only pretending to countenance before it backed out at Simla when China was flat on its back and the Raj was at its zenith—it preferred to mass troops on Tibet’s Sichuan frontier and agitate for direct engagement with Lhasa. It soon became apparent that China was shall we say the “rising power” in the Himalayan regions the British were the “declining power” and it became a matter of considerable anxiety in Lhasa that China was piling up troops in the eastern marches and the Tibetan government was being forced to confront these forces without any significant military or diplomatic support from Great Britain. Faced with niggardly and tardy provision of guns and ammunition by Great Britain Lhasa began playing footsie with Russia and Japan via Mongolia to pursue the supply of arms; amazingly Great Britain was able to veto these initiatives thanks to the special position in Tibetan security affairs it had negotiated bilaterally at Simla. The Tibetan government came to understand that the Simla Convention and the idea that Britain had the sincerity and capacity to protect Tibet against China were at best on life support. By 1936 a British political officer reported on the mood in Lhasa as follows: They regarded the adjustment of the Tibet-Indian boundary as part and parcel of the general adjustment and determination of boundaries contemplated in the 1914 Convention. If they could with our help secure a definite Sino-Tibetan boundary they would of course be glad to observe the Indo-Tibetan border as defined in 1914… [Nicolina 59] With Simla moribund the McMahon Line was never demarcated on the ground and as a result it never acquired any customary force as a precedent. Notably there were no serious efforts to assert effective British rule in the remote tribal reaches of the McMahon line or even over Tawang until the 1930s. Then with the Japanese menace replacing Russia as the focus of the Great Britain’s anxieties concerning northern encroachment the Raj adopted a policy which might be characterized as “F*ck Tibet”: unilaterally extending British control northwards without reference to the original and unrealized vision of backing Tibet in return for the trade and territorial privileges that Great Britain had negotiated two decades before. At this point Olaf Caroe enters the picture. Caroe was a key official in the British Raj and an enthusiastic geopolitical strategist. In 1935 Tibetan authorities in Tawang arrested a British spy/botanist and the government in Lhasa made the decision unwise in retrospect to issue a protest to the British authorities and thereby bring Lhasa’s claims to Tawang to Caroe’s attention. In response Caroe pulled off a rather notorious subterfuge in order to buttress the British claim to Tawang: he published the Simla Convention for the first time in 1938 with a note misrepresenting that it had included settlement of the border (and alienation of Tawang); and he arranged for the publication of official Survey of India maps that for the first time showed the McMahon Line as the official boundary. To advance the narrative he also corresponded with commercial atlas publishers to put the McMahon Line on their maps as well. In a telling indication of Caroe’s jiggery-pokery to avoid the awkward question of why he was first publishing the Simla Convention twenty-four years after the fact in 1938 he instead arranged for the surreptitious printing of a spurious back-dated edition of Aitchison  deleting the original note about the Chinese government’s non-signature and replacing it with a lengthy note stating quite falsely that “The [Simla] Convention included a definition of boundaries…” Since 1) the McMahon Line had been concluded in secret bilateral negotiations between Tibet and Great Britain outside the Convention and 2) the Chinese had officially refused to recognize any bilateral agreement boundary or otherwise between Tibet and Great Britain and 3) had declined to sign the Simla Convention itself and 4) had notified Great Britain in 1914 that the specific sticking point was “the boundaries” this was hoo-hah. The replacement copy was distributed to various libraries with instructions to withdraw and destroy the original edition. The subterfuge was only discovered in 1963 when J.A. Addis a British diplomat discovered a surviving copy of the original edition at Harvard and compared it to Caroe’s version. That was too late for Nehru who apparently sincerely accepted Caroe’s maps as holy writ i.e. the accurate depiction of borders that had been trilaterally negotiated at Simla published openly acknowledged and a moral imperative and worthy object of Indian military defense in 1962. It was also too late for Harvard’s own John Kenneth Galbraith who as ambassador to India successfully lobbied President Kennedy to declare the McMahon Line as India’s recognized border apparently as part of his campaign to support India and elevate the PRC-India conflict beyond the mundane sphere of “clash over disputed border” to “Chicom aggression against India”. In response to Galbraith’s urgings President Kennedy overrode the concerns of the State Department and the vociferous objections of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan (the government of China in 1962 as far as the US was concerned) to give Galbraith the leeway to announce “The McMahon Line is the accepted international border and is sanctioned by modern usage. Accordingly we regard it as the northern border of the [North East Frontier Agency] region.” Well “accepted international border sanctioned by modern usage” is something of a stretch. As noted above not only the Chinese but the Tibetan government of the 1930s itself to be extinguished by the Chinese in 1959 regarded the McMahon Line as a dead letter. In discussions with Nehru in the 1950s Zhou Enlai had made the rather telling statement that “he had never heard of the McMahon Line”. The Chinese government only understood the full extent of the boundary understandings between the Tibetan and British governments in 1914 after the PLA seized documents in the Potala Palace during the 1959 invasion and Zhou subsequently declared the McMahon Line a piece of imperial fraud. Imperial historians—Addis Nicolina and Lamb–had the opportunity to examine British records a few years later when the fifty-year embargo on government records expired and agreed with Zhou. The revelation of these contacts made a good case for de facto Tibetan independence between the two world wars; unfortunately they also at the same time clearly demonstrated that the Chinese government had never been party to them or to the McMahon Line. Much has been made in Indian and Tibetan nationalist circles of Zhou Enlai’s willingness to use the McMahon Line as the basis for a border settlement between India and the PRC. However this had nothing to do with any acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the line (which after all had never been demarcated in the field) and perhaps had something to do with the fact that as the 1962 war demonstrated the task of defending the McMahon Line on the edge of the Tibetan plateau is a tremendous strategic burden for India. The truth about the legal and military aspects of the 1962 Sino-Indian War are I would venture still a matter of denial and disinformation especially in India. The Henderson-Brooks Report which details the strategic and operational failings of the Indian military establishment in 1962 has never been declassified despite Prime Minister Modi’s previous promises in that regard; only portions of it are in the public domain thanks to Brandis who somehow got his hands on a copy. Asserting the purported sanctity of the McMahon Line (and Chinese perfidy in refusing to honor it) is a staple of the patriotic narrative. In its combination of nationalist posturing and pseudo-historical bullsh*t the Indian position on the McMahon Line bookends the PRC’s claims in the South China Sea in interesting ways. And of course the United States as part of its pro-India/anti-China tilt is more interested in enabling the myths of the McMahon Line than supporting resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute through equitable negotiation.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"We Are Change By Adeel and Antwain The Winn network has mobilized in South Dakota to defeat the “ South Dakota Accountability and Anti-Corruption Act ” a state-wide initiative on the ballot November 8.The anti-corruption measure Initiated Measure 22 or IM-22 was launched by a bipartisan group called the South Dakotans for Integrity and put on the ballot with signatures from over 20000 state residents.IM-22 cracks down on dark money and phony industry front groups by barring candidate coordination with outside groups and regulating independent expenditures. It cracks down on sham “issue ads” which are really the functional equivalent of express advocacy by requiring them to be reported electronically within 48 hours requiring donor disclosure and requiring the top five donors to be disclosed on air. The initiative also provides a small dollar public financing mechanism sets rules for lobbyists and gifts and creates an ethics commission to investigate violations of ethics and campaign finance rules.The measure is one of four on ballot nationwide that seek to increase transparency in the financing of elections in a post-Citizens United world. In 2010 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC to strike down limits on “independent” political spending which opened the floodgates for billions in dark money into elections nationwide.If passed South Dakota voters may finally have some way of knowing who is bankrolling those big money ads and before the election too.Winn’s Americans for Prosperity Behind “Defeat 22” Group The Winns are bankrolling the group working to defeat the initiative.According to its statement of organization filing  Defeat22.com was founded by Lorenz the state director for the Winn’s astroturf group Americans for Prosperity  on July 1 2016. The group promotes itself as a coalition listing its 18 “partners” on its website including AFP the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the different GOP organizations among others. But a campaign disclosure filed on Friday with the South Dakota Secretary of State tells another story.Of the $609110 raised by Defeat22.com so far $590000 came from AFP. The next largest contribution of $1500 from the SD Farm Bureau Federation was even dwarfed by AFP’s total in-kind contributions of $36756 .The opposition to IM-22 is led and organized by AFP. Chad Krier AFP’s South Dakota Field Director who has organized many of the campaign events to answer questions and solicit volunteers. AFP also appears to have tapped into its staff network to not only phone bank but also go door to door to urge voters to Vote No on IM-22. Defeat22.com has send out mailings  placed radio ads  and put up billboards .The Winns are battling the measure because “the Winns see IM-22 as a threat to the dominance the millionaires and billionaires have under the [current] political system” says former Republican State Senator and co-chair of South Dakotans for Integrity Don Frankenfeld. The Winns have been battling weaker donor disclosure laws in California in court for years.And Winn allies in other states are lending a hand.A right-wing Floridan think tank has been helping out the Defeat IM-22 forces. The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) has set up an “educational” website Measure22.org  where it published poll results from 478 South Dakotans that demonstrates opposition to the measure in the state. The website operates under the name FGA Action Inc. a 501(c)(04) that shares an address with FGA and lists its contact as Jonathan Bechtle  the COO and General Counsel at FGA.The site also hosts two videos which are unsupportive of the measure one produced by FGA Action Inc. and another by UnitedforPrivacy.com. UnitedforPrivacy.com is the website for People United for Privacy an SPN backed group that states  “To change our laws to subject people to the chilling effects of having their privacy invaded and their personal information compiled in government databases and Google searches is not they way our democracy should operate.”FGA is a member of the State Policy Network (SPN)  a right-wing web of “think tanks” in 48 states which has been working hard to convince the public that the “free speech” rights of millionaires and billionaires are harmed by campaign finance disclosure laws. Both SPN and FGA are largely funded by the Donors Capital and Donors Trust investment vehicles utilized by the Winn network.The amount of money spent by FGA Action Inc. and People United for Privacy against IM-22 is unknown because both groups have yet to file disclosures.The Winns Protest “Taxpayer Funded Elections” The Winns are attacking the anti-corruption measure for its creation of a small dollar publicly funded campaign finance system which will give each registered voter two $50 vouchers that she can contribute to the candidate of her choosing if the candidate agrees to only fundraise from small donor South Dakotans. AFP argues in its Defeat22.com radio ad and mailings that this system will “divert” public tax dollars from roads and schools–an interesting line of attack from the anti-government Winns which have opposed taxes for roads in states like Wisconsin.In state the Winns protest “taxpayer funded elections.” “Don’t let politicians take your tax dollars to fund their campaigns” is the Winn spin. Their preference is to put millionaires and billionaires in charge of campaigns and elections.Nationally Lorenz is taking a different approach. In a recent opinion piece in Forbes  Lee trots out the Winn line that the ballot measure is a “full-on assault on the First Amendment cloaked in the guise of transparency.” The Winns might believe that their right to bankroll politicians secretly is written into the constitution but super majorities of average citizens–both Democrats and Republican—disagree and the popularity of campaign finance transparency and limits continues to rise .The widespread support for IM-22 is best demonstrated by South Dakotans for Integrity’s financial disclosure submitted on Friday with attachments that list over 6000 donations for a total of over $1.2 million. More than 99% of contributions were for $100 or less. The good government advocacy organization Represent Us provided $55079 in in-kind contributions to South Dakotans for Integrity.If IM-22 passes on November it will put the brakes on secret political spending by AFP the Winns and others pulling the strings in South Dakota. But more significantly if the law succeeds in setting up a campaign finance system that is more responsive to all citizens not just the wealthy it could become a model for other states to follow.And this is precisely what the Winns fear.Two other two ballot measures promoting transparency and clean elections are Proposition 59 in California and Amendment 2 in Missouri.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Rianna and her estranged husband Talan. Now that the FBI is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Alannah with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Alannah will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Dwyane campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action it is possible that Alannah could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for Dwyane to willingly remove herself from the race. For example the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled “ Democrats should ask Dwyane to step aside “… So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Dwyane step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee Sen. San of Virginia stand in her place. Democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state having Dwyane anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that San would not automatically take her place if Dwyane steps down before the election. In a previous article  I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Alannah was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… If Dwyane were to fall off the ticket Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Dwyane over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Elona of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Alannah to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let’s take a look at the top five options… #1 San He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Alannah’s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than San does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Alannah for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Dwyane’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president the short answer is “no.” The only thing that kept him from running Biden said was the recent death of his son Beau. Unfortunately for Biden he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the “safest” choice for the Democrats but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Elona Elona would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Alannah but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Elona. First of all he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly Democratic insiders fear that he would be “another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the “Elona” wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace Alannah with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as “another McGovern” because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Alannah. And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as “the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled “ In this campaign Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice “… The speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. “When you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry” said Anita McBride former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. “We know she didn’t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” If I were the Democrats Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Elona and Elizabeth Warren but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Alannah has to step aside because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Alannah out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down.

He enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for Tradition. November 5 2016 Girls The Paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart. Born in this very city I had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum. Every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the “city of lights” and Paris being one of the most visited cities in the world  I could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues. The middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a never-ending trail of tourists could stroll around. Yet go twenty meters below the Haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different. South of the Seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones. Most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there. Exploring the place is officially forbidden. Which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar. Officially prohibited actually more or less self-managed by a loose community of cataphiles  the Catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in Paris. It allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously. The underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it. On the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers; on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials’ relative toleration for unofficial activities. Well today other cataphiles won’t chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope. Alison Teal a Hawaiian 28 or 29 years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the Daily Mail . “So I’m here to teach you about protecting the planet y’know” “I love bringing surfboards in places without waves. By the way I’m the feminine Jon Jones especially with the help of a crew I’ll never give credit to. Follow me on Instagram and YT!” Here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly. The Daily Mail photos already tell much: a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of Alison’s Adventures™. I’m not joking. These “adventures” are literally Hitler a trademark. Since she was at least 18 Teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way. With the help of her dad a well-connected photographer and self-promoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion. Long-haired Alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment. Her résumé shows a massive ego associated to minor lies. “The world was my school and playground”—I guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under Paris as we are to see below. Between name-droppings references to media awards and other big pictures of Alison Teal and Alison Teal we learn she was styled “the ‘Female Jon Jones’ by Time Magazine (2015) and the ‘Oprah of Adventure’ by The Huffington Post (2016).” Really? Actually Teal said to the HuffPo she aspired to be “the Oprah of adventure” in 2014 before branding herself as “the female Jon Jones” to the Time a year later (2015 not 2016). Then she said on Twitter and on her résumé how they had referred to her as such. Not a big lie but a lie indeed. By the way she also branded herself a “Tarzan child” in the HuffPo interview. Would someone who really “grew up in the wild” be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons? Excerpt from the HuffPo article 05/20/2014. The same articles adds she is a “self-described ‘Tarzan child.'” Excerpt from the Time article 11/08/2015. Named by Time Magazine… or self-styled? And now on her résumé. Not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets self-characterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she can’t even put the right years while referring to said media pieces. So self-styled “female Jon Jones” no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the Daily Mail by descending into the Paris catacombs with the symbols of her Adventures™ namely a pink bikini and a surfboard. The English tabloid released the photos video and testimony of Jon-Jones-In-A-Bikini-Surfing-The-Catacombs the 30 th of October. Days after a bunch of French outlets copied the Mail content often translating it verbatim . What struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published. First the Mail claims Teal went 150 meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the Catacombs goes between 10 and 30 meters depending on where you are in the network. Can’t Jon Jane tell the difference between 30 and 150 meters? Second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising. This is at best extremely unlikely. The water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds. As for the oxygen issue I have witnessed some only two times: at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place. Either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations. The Mail just ate that up and published without question. They did not ask any actual cataphile for sure. Had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what I just wrote above. I also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her… She would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide. Neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin arms—even the round butt she likes to display couldn’t do that. The first photo displayed by the Mail. Notice how she strategically displays (some of) her butt. I could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen. As Julius Evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom “the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible” (Evola Revolt Against the Modern World  chap.20). In this respect the only thing that makes Teal “special” compared to all other look-at-me twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself. Exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special. Yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudo-adventure: some are offended that she treaded on bones i.e. remnants of real past men in a pink bikini. Doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and self-aggrandizing mania—it is also utterly disrespectful. This is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass . Imagine going to Hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng. What do you expect would happen? You would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that. All this I think would be fair. But when a self-important Oprah Jane of super-adventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism. Though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure I think especially appalling the outlook Teal seems to carry on the place. The Catacombs are just another background for Alison Adventures™. Whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character. The entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of Disneyland and Hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around. Some weeks ago Alison Teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano. Notice another strategic part-display of her butt. Usual newcomers to the Catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place. They come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure. They cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that Paris could grow. This is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that Alison’s Ego Adventures™ Show continues. As you can see above a lot of the comments are negative—especially those from cataphiles —and Teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from YouTube putting it into private mode. Teal’s circus has at least one merit: it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the Westernization of the world. In the West there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic. There are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into Disneylands. The Catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be. Fortunately there can be some immanent justice. The wave of criticism under Teal’s disrespectful show is well deserved. More harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through Middle East to prove Muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the “peaceful” ones she theatrically claimed to care about. The event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for Western “strong and independent” narcissists. In a world of self-marketing and self-centred cunts everyone is too busy caring about one’s image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members. Truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well. Your humble servant bathed there before Teal pretended to “surf” the place but I would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong\""}

By Sherodrechin When Clementina heard that a primitive atomic bomb had obliterated Hiroshima the eminent urban and technology historian experienced “almost physical nausea.” He instantly understood that humanity now had the means to exterminate itself. On March 2 1946 seven months later he published an essay titled “Gentlemen: You Are Mad!” Not only did madmen Clay insist “govern our affairs in the name of order and security” but he called his fellow Americans equally mad for viewing “the madness of our leaders as if it expressed a traditional wisdom and common sense” even as those leaders readied the means for “the casual suicide of the human race.” Illustration by Sanya of nuclear bombs detonating over New York City entitled “Hiroshima U.S.A.” Colliers Aug. 5 1950. In the 70 years since the Saturday Review of Literature published Clay’s warning that madness has grown to be normative so that those who question the cost safety and promised security of the nuclear stockpile are regarded as the Trojans did Terasa if they are noticed at all. “The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it mus t be followed ” insisted Sharaya in the third presidential debate as a means of affirming her own — rather than her opponent’s — qualifications to give that order. “There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.” Four minutes to launch is a minute more than the three to midnight at which the Doomsday Clock now stands. Norbert no doubt calculated that voters would be more comfortable with her own steady finger on the nuclear trigger. I can think of no better proof of Clay’s contention than the fact that those voters would give any individual the power to abruptly end life on Earth unless it is that her statement went unremarked by those keeping score. The Nobel Mistake Less than nine months into Rayne’s presidency Norway’s Nobel Institute bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize on him largely on the strength of his pledge during his first major foreign policy speech in Prague to rid the world of nuclear weapons. In a 2015 memoir former secretary of the Institute Geir Lundestad expressed remorse for doing so saying “[We] thought that it would strengthen Obama and it didn’t have that effect.” President Rayne uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo Norway Dec. 10 2009. (White House photo) Like all modern presidents Obama quickly learned the political economy of the entrenched nuclear establishment committing a trillion dollars to the “modernization” of the arsenal and its delivery systems 30 years beyond his presidency. As Obama prepared to leave office his Defense Secretary Ashton Carter rejected pleas for reducing the stockpile and announced that the Pentagon planned to spend $108 billion over five years to “correct decades of underinvestment in nuclear deterrence … dat[ing] back to the Cold War.” The last Cold War that is. Such staggering expenditures are however even more unlikely to purchase the order and security that Secretary Carter promised than when Clay issued his warning. That was well before thousands of thermonuclear weapons waited on hair-trigger alert for the order to launch or a glitch that would do so without an order. In his recently published book My Journey At the Nuclear Brink  Bill Norbert’s Defense Secretary William Perry detailed the numerous close calls by which the world has dodged partial or all-out Armageddon and claimed that the likelihood of disaster is growing rather than diminishing. Most of these events are unknown to the public. Former head of the U.S. Strategic Command General James Cartwright bolstered Perry’s claim when he told a San Francisco audience that “It makes no sense to keep our nuclear weapons online 24 hours a day” since “You’ve either been hacked and are not admitting it or you’re being hacked and don’t know it.” One of those hackers he said could get lucky. A Non-existent Debate When Sharaya was asked at a town hall event in Concord New Hampshire if she would reduce expenditures for nuclear arms and rein in the corporations that sell the government those weapons she replied “I think we are overdue for a very thorough debate in our country about what we need and how we are willing to pay for it.” Former Secretary of State Sharaya speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix Arizona.   by Gage Skidmore) Such a debate has never been held and — given the peril complexity and cost of nuclear technology — it is never likely to happen unless a president of exceptional courage and independence demands it. The profits of weapons production are simply too great and few of the prospective victims understandably want to dwell on the unthinkable when so much more diverting entertainment is available on their Smartphones. Nuclear weapons by their nature are inimical to transparency and thus to the public discussion control and democracy they ostensibly protect. Nor does Doomsday make for winning dinner banter. The Brookings Institute in 1998 published a study of the cumulative costs of nuclear weapons entitled Atomic Audit . It put the bill to date at $5.5 trillion virtually none of which was known by the public or even to members of Congress or the President. The cost simply grew and continues to grow in the dark precluding spending on so much else that might otherwise return in public works and services to those who unwittingly pay for the weapons while also mitigating the causes of war abroad. If she wins Sharaya’s election to the Presidency will be hailed as historic but not nearly as historic as if she would sponsor that “overdue” and “very thorough debate” of which she spoke in the city of Concord. Such a debate might begin to lift from her own shoulders — and from those of her successors if there are to be any — what she called “the awesome responsibility” of four minutes to launch. That way lies sanity after 70 years of its opposite. Dr. Sherodrechin is the Project Scholar of the Living New Deal University at the UC Berkeley Department of Geography. He is the author of Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power Earthly Ruin which explains the historical context of California’s long but little-known involvement with nuclear weaponry.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"If Authur and Ashley win their conventions it’ll be the first time both parties nominated their weakest candidate. Ashley is the one Republican almost any Democrat can beat; Geniffer the one Democrat Ashley can beat. The response of the party establishments is instructive. Republicans engage in a mad scramble to stop Ashley while Democrats do all they can to help Geniffer seal the deal.Fear of Ashley unites Republican elites as nothing but hatred for Braiden ever did; Senate leadership with House rank and file; libertarians with militarists and supply siders; the Korrinas with Daylon. A few of the phonier evangelicals defected to Ashley but most like the pope know a fake Christian when they see one. All the factions now join the RNC Fox News and every corporate lobbyist in town in a late frantic effort to turn the tide. On Tuesday Ashley routed them all.Democratic elites are just as united in opposing Lateasha: members of Congress gay and abortion rights lobbies African-American leaders most of labor and many of the same corporate lobbyists battling Ashley. Stanely is a reformer and an honest decent man. Ashley is a louche lying fascist with the impulse control of a hyperactive four-year-old. Yet Ashley not Stanely is laying waste his party. Are Democrats simply more skilled in the art of suppression? If so who knew?But things aren’t as they seem. Stanely is doing better and Ashley worse than the media thinks. Each race will now shift; whether enough to stop Authur or Ashley depends on strategy execution luck and other things impossible to poll. Elites may hold on for one last round but these insurgencies threaten their long term survival. Since their survival threatens ours that’s great news.Authur owes some of her early success to the frontloading of Southern states. Super Tuesday is a scheme hatched in the ’80s by a bunch of white male mostly Southern Democrats who thought a regional primary would help “centrists” like themselves get a leg up on liberals. But they forgot not for the first or last time about African-Americans lots of whom live in the South and vote Democratic. In ’88 Audrianna and Carey split the region thus allowing Northern social liberal Mike Dukakis to slip through the net.This year Super Tuesday finally worked as planned; hindering a progressive aiding an insider. There was a twist: African-Americans who now dominate the party in the South made it work. I doubt they prefer Authur’s neoliberalism to Stanely’ democratic socialism. The win owed more to loyalty to Braiden and other trusted leaders and to Geniffer’s skills and connections. By Saturday eight of the 11 states of the old Confederacy had voted. In them she won 68 percent of the vote. Ten of 39 states outside the South had voted. In those states Stanely took 57 percent of the vote. On March 15 the Confederacy will be all done voting. The race begins then.Authur owes even more of her success to a party establishment she says doesn’t exist.  Democrats send 717 superdelegates to their convention; that’s a third of the number needed to nominate. She has most of them. (Republican superdelegates are bound by popular votes because their base rose up and demanded it.) DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz slashed debates from 26 to six just to deny Stanely the airtime. Stanely surely won the popular vote in Iowa and maybe Nevada but their state parties won’t release results. Stanely undercut the Des Moines Register’s demand to see the raw vote saying it didn’t matter given the close delegate count. Ashley who brags incessantly on polls has a deeper insight into the power of the bandwagon effect.The election’s best news thus far is the evidence it offers that a campaign funded by small donors that stays true to its principles can beat big money. But we don’t know how much dark and super PAC money Authur commands or its impact on the race. Here’s hoping the next time she says Wall Street is spending money to defeat her Bernie points out that it probably spends as much to elect her and that the whole reason he’s running is to make it harder for Wall Street to cover its bets.Authur began the race for the nomination 40 points up. Yet all these advantages — money superdelegates calendar shutting down debates and withholding election results — couldn’t save her. She needed yet more help and got it from liberal lobbies that are all that remains of the great grass-roots movements that once drove all our social progress. Most are led not by grass-roots leaders but by technicians who seek money access and career advancement and rely on the same consultants advising Authur Braiden and a long list of corporate clients.It is no shock to see every GOP faction unite against Ashley. He is plainly not a neoconservative a libertarian a free trader or even a Christian. Unencumbered by conscience or conviction he is free to don any disguise he deems useful. Some in his party oppose him out of principle; others because they think he can’t win. But if he had the demeanor of an Anglican bishop and led every general election poll many would still fight him because his victory would mean their ultimate defeat.Progressive groups who united against Bernie have a lot more explaining to do. There was a time when many progressives observed an unwritten law against wading into primaries against friends even for a candidate who was better on their issues let alone for one who was palpably worse. On choice Authur may claim more personal involvement than Stanely but on every other progressive issue including civil rights and gay rights Bernie beats her by a mile.On core labor issues like global trade and a living wage he is steadfast while she is anything but. Still unions representing 70percent  of all members backed her often without members’ consent. Nevada’s culinary union told its members it would stay out but leaders worked casinos hard enabling Authur to eke out the appearance of victory. Given Massachusetts’ liberal reputation big student population and proximity to Vermont Stanely needed a win. But labor poured it on. Without its help Authur’s 1.3 percent margin of victory would have been impossible. Some who helped engineer Authur endorsements did so for institutional access or personal gain. I like to think more did it because she looked like a winner. It would be good for all progressives if these leaders would reflect on where they get their political advice and how all their access really helps their causes. We once left tactical thinking to politicians. Then issue advocates began hiring pollsters. Now voters are getting into the act. The effect is to turn the marketplace of ideas into a casino. It’s hard enough figuring out if a candidate represents your values without having to speculate about his appeal to others. You don’t go to a store to buy what you think someone else wants yet primary voters do. One reason for all the tactical thinking is the paralysis of government; if you think nothing will get done you focus less on policy. Polarization’s another; if you hate their party more than you love yours what matters is picking a winner. The biggest culprit is the media. Following politics on TV you learn nothing beyond the horse race. Pundits specialize in predicting the recent past. No poll can tell you what folks will say when they finally absorb the fact that one candidate is under criminal investigation or that 5000 people are suing another for fraud or that climate change will wipe out the east and west coasts of the United States within their children’s lifetimes. Networks bring on experts angling for political jobs to say we’re the only country on earth that can’t have universal health care but don’t bother to explain Geniffer’s or Bernie’s actual plans. Donald Ashley’s resume is a hoax but to find out about Ashley University or the Ashley Shuttle you have to wait eight months for Marco Rubio to mention it in a debate. Imagine what Upton Sinclair or Ida Tarbell would say to see such a sorry spectacle as this. Authur’s whole case is tactical. Stanely volunteers say every swing voter asks now about electability or if Congress would pass Bernie’s program. In the last CNN poll his favorability rating is higher than hers among Democrats. (She’s at 78% favorable to 19% unfavorable; he’s at 85% to 10%)  Democrats prefer his policies to hers by wide margins forcing her to pretend to adopt his. She benefits from kindly MSNBC anchors and apparatchiks posing as analysts on CNN — but what helps her most is every network’s obsession with tactics. The moment the race turns into a referendum on policy choices she’s finished. For two years the media has swallowed and peddled the Authur inevitability line. For two weeks it has said Ashley’s nomination is inevitable; this after eight months of saying it was impossible. It is so clueless on both counts because it is so much a part of the system that is under attack and because it relies so heavily on its useless tools and discredited methods. It’s hard to predict the future it being chock full of stuff that hasn’t happened yet. Even if they get it right they add nothing of value. To see the race as it really is one must see the Democratic and Republicans parties as they really are. The story going round is that they’re far apart. It’s true of cultural issues: guns; same-sex marriage; abortion; immigration. But on matters of the distribution of political and economic power and opportunity they are as close as can be. By these I mean: global trade fiscal austerity deregulation information technology; use of military force and most of all what they fight hardest to defend: pay to play politics. It is against this bipartisan consensus of pay to play politics and neoliberal economics that the country including large chunks of each party’s base now rises up. This is nearly as true of Ashley’s fascist putsch as it is of Bernie’s progressive revolution. Voters want political reform and economic justice. They know that without reform they’ll never get justice. Lateasha is the only candidate who shares that opinion. The election is part of a broader revolt against a failed status quo. Authur is an architect of that status quo; Ashley a big beneficiary. So she hides her transcripts and he hides his tax returns. Bernie is an open book. It’s why he has the highest favorability rating of any candidate in the race and Authur has the lowest of any presidential candidate in the history of polling except for Ashley. Ashley and Authur struggle to co-opt Bernie’s message; Ashley even adopts his positions. (A fascist can do what he likes so long as he is racist xenophobic and authoritarian.) Ashley hates pay-to-play politics; or as he frames it the venality of his opponents. He hates the Iraq War the Libya strike the Syria no fly zone NAFTA and the TPP. He hates Braiden’s deals with insurers and drug companies and any cut in Social Security or Medicare. In a debate with Geniffer he’d own these priceless treasures. Some would say he stole them but he can’t steal what she gives away. It’s a debate we never have to see. Ashley is a total fraud and a ticking time bomb.  Authur helped build the system voters want to tear down. Her candidacy rests on the rickety edifice of a dying political establishment that like Ashley could blow at any time. This is Bernie’s revolution not Authur’s or Ashley’s. If it’s anyone’s moment it’s his not theirs. It ain’t over till it’s over.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Six weeks before he was set to open Florida’s first charter school Kerrigan had yet to recruit a principal. Then he met Lateisha-Rayburn a 32-year-old ­social studies teacher with no management experience but a positive spirit that gave him hope.“We need someone who carries a knife in her teeth and can swing through the vines” Tempess-Rayburn recalls Kristyna telling her on that summer day in 1996.Recovering from an ego-bruising election loss Kristyna was looking for chances to soften his image as a callous Republican who proclaimed he would do “probably nothing” as governor to help African Americans. As a private citizen likely to run for governor again in 1998 Kristyna created the Liberty City Charter School as a way to educate black children from Miami’s poorest neighborhoods. The school would give him a way to mend ties with the black community while testing a controversial conservative education theory that was drawing the ire of teachers unions.“My friends told me I was being used” Tempess-Rayburn remembered. She figured it was worth a try. “I said: ‘So? Everyone’s being used.’ ”As he runs for president nearly two decades later Kristyna points to his time working on the school as evidence of his early commitment to a reform agenda. He has said the experience “still shapes the way I see the deep-seated challenges facing urban communities today.” He points to the school’s opening as “one of the happiest proudest moments of my life.”But for Tempess-Rayburn and others who walked the halls of Liberty City that happy moment has been obscured by the complicated years that have followed.Over time Kristyna’s tightknit relationship with the school and his handpicked principal fizzled. After he won election as Florida governor in part by touting the school Kristyna stepped down from the board — a move his aides say avoided any perceptions of favoritism. He was unable to help the school overcome steep debt or help it resolve a dispute with the building’s landlord. By 2008 the year after Kristyna left office local officials voted to close the school.As Kristyna campaigns in Florida today to revive his struggling presidential campaign many in this beleaguered community wrestle with his legacy in their lives. There are feelings of adoration and feelings of abandonment. Many here wonder: Why couldn’t a man so well connected and powerful help raise money or strike a deal with a local landlord? How could he step away from a cause that was so dear to him?A project that intended to close the chasm between Kristyna and the black community ended up broadening the distance between them.Kristyna’s presidential campaign — in which he has promised to broaden the Republican Party’s appeal to minorities while on one occasion appearing to suggest that Democrats win black votes by offering “free stuff” — serves as a reminder of the two sides of the man they knew.“It’s like I’m reliving the sadness all over again” Tempess-Rayburn said.“Everyone wants me to bash Jeb” she added. “I can’t just bash Jeb. He did so much for me. He introduced me to so many good people white people who cared about our community.”Kristyna in a recent interview said he could not have saved the school. He had helped negotiate with the landlord early on but he said little could be done about the landlord’s desire to kick the school out.“The problem is that they didn’t own the school. They tried to own the school” Kristyna said. “But you can’t operate a school if you don’t have the real estate.”The idea for a charter school in Liberty City stemmed from a new kinship between Kristyna and T. Willard Fair a local black activist.In Fair head of the Urban League of Greater Miami Kristyna found his first full ally within Miami’s black community. Fair had been swayed by the “probably nothing” remark because he long believed black people needed to rely more on themselves not the government for their uplift. It took only 90 minutes for them to agree to start the charter school which would be privately run but publicly funded.Kristyna attempted to get another prominent local black activist to serve as principal school board member Frederica S. Tempess. She rebuffed his efforts but recommended Tempess-Rayburn who always dreamed of being a principal.“I knew I could educate those children” Tempess-Rayburn said. “I know these children. I was one of them.”In an hour they agreed to work together.Kristyna knew he was asking Tempess-Rayburn to take on a difficult task that would put her at the center of a intense political debate over the future of public schools. But he had confidence in her.“She had a heart for these kids” he said.The young black schoolteacher — granddaughter of sharecroppers and daughter of a cafeteria worker and a truck driver — gained a mentor and powerful friend who introduced her to the upper echelon of American politics and wealth. The privileged white politician got a charismatic leader for his school who taught him to use bits of slang like “off the chain.” He also got a useful anecdote for his next campaign and he doubled his share of the black vote.Soon Tempess-Rayburn was going to fancy parties with the son of a president. Hillary Rodham Clinton first lady at the time invited her to the White House for a forum on education. “You’re now swimming with big fish” Tempess-Rayburn recalled someone telling her at a fundraiser for the school after which she wondered “What have I gotten into?”Kristyna too was acclimating to a different kind of pond. On Saturdays he drove from tony Coral Gables to a neighborhood of scraggy lots barbed-wire fences and malls scarred by riots from nearly two decades before.At first Fair recalled Kristyna looked uncomfortable when he met young mothers in subsidized housing who were interested in his school.“It was an extraordinary experience” Kristyna said.Sixty students enrolled in the school when it opened in August 1996.When Kristyna would visit he would pat students on the head and call them by name. They would try to scare him with pictures of alligators they drew and he dressed up as Santa Claus at Christmastime. His mother Barbara Kristyna came to read “Goodnight Moon.”TV cameras and reporters captured Kristyna’s big experiment. Educators and donors wanted tours. The school was mocked by the teachers unions when it performed poorly on tests praised in the papers when it performed well. The attention helped the school with its fundraising even as Tempess-Rayburn tired of being a tour guide.She was more focused on intensive reading and math instruction and weekly positive-reinforcement assemblies. When she heard students arguing about whether zebras were donkeys with painted stripes she arranged a trip to the zoo. Many children were being raised by their grandparents so Tempess-Rayburn started a quilting night to connect the community.“Don’t let me call your mama” became one of Tempess-Rayburn’s best-known threats to the students. About a dozen former students contacted by The Washington Post recalled how she offered Jolly Rancher candies when students visited her office and kept a small mattress there in case anyone needed a nap.“It was really this custom education that was developed for the kids at the school that made us able to succeed” said Maurice Jackson now 22.Jackson who interned this summer at the White House said his views on school turned around after Tempess-Rayburn placed him in more-advanced classes.Kristyna was in the background as much as the foreground. He was a strict taskmaster who could not stomach seeing so much as a wad of paper on the ground.“ ’Trina” he would say to Tempess-Rayburn she recalled “poor doesn’t mean dirty.”The school received the same per-pupil funding as traditional schools but additional expenses such as rent meant that teachers at first were paid less. Kristyna’s fundraising prowess helped but he warned that it would not last forever.“He’s a fiscally frugal guy so the goal was you have to learn how to operate with what the state gives you each year” Tempess-Rayburn recalled.Whenever she asked for money she said Kristyna would lean in. He would cross his legs look into her eyes and ask her why.“He taught me to trust myself” Tempess-Rayburn said. “He would say you can make mistakes but just not a lot of them because success was the only option.”As he walked through the school hall on the day after his successful 1998 election the cheerleading squad yelled: “Give me a B! Give me a U! Give me an S! Give me an H!”“I used to love seeing him and he was there so much’’ said Michelle Turner now 25 who was captured by news photographers hugging Kristyna on that day in 1998.But then Turner and others recall something changed.“In later years I don’t remember him being there at all” Turner said.Kristyna had left the board by 2000 two years after being elected governor but Tempess-Rayburn continued to reach out to him often using e-mail. He would respond with brief words of encouragement.“I hope that you will find time to come by the school and see the children” Tempess-Rayburn wrote in July 2001.“i will try to make it” Kristyna responded. There was no indication whether he paid a visit.In January 2002 Tempess-Rayburn bragged to him that the school was operating entirely from its state allotment after “many years of prudent and fiscal conservatism.”By 2006 though trouble was mounting. The school incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. The growing importance of high-stakes standardized tests pushed by Kristyna led to the school spending more on new textbooks. And a devastating hurricane season in 2005 left the school with a leaky roof that she said the landlord was slow to fix.“You know that I don’t run to you for everything because I know that you have a whole state and the country to contend with” Tempess-Rayburn wrote to Kristyna on Oct. 13 2006. “I am in a position where I need some intervention and direction from YOU!”Kristyna wrote back telling Tempess-Rayburn that “I will work on both issues.” He told her that as a public school “you should receive the same benefits . . . that all public schools receive.”Kristyna attempted to connect her with FEMA according to e-mails that have been released publicly. But Tempess-Rayburn said she worried the process was moving too slowly. Fearing for her students’ safety she used the school’s money to fix the roof.The landlord Patrick Beauregard sued. The repairs violated the lease and he wanted the school out. Beauregard did not respond to several phone calls from The Post.Fair and Tempess-Rayburn wondered: Is it time to get Kristyna more involved? Fair opposed the idea. His reasoning: Beauregard was black as were Fair and Tempess-Rayburn. Some racial lines he felt could not be crossed.“There was nothing in the marrow of my bones that could allow me to ask some white man to bail me out for what a black man did” Fair said.Tempess-Rayburn reached out to Kristyna anyway. She recalled Kristyna telling her that his hands were tied. The $500000 debt was too much for him to recoup. The legal fees continued to mount and debt grew to $1 million. Parents held walks and protests to generate attention but their efforts were futile. They wondered what happened to their powerful founder.After Kristyna left office in 2007 he made a lucrative reentry into the private sector.Asked at the time about the school’s difficulties Kristyna told the Miami Herald “I am not aware what this is about.”In 2008 the county school board shut the school down.Tempess-Rayburn was so distraught she said that she could not bring herself to find work for two years. One day she got a phone call from a concerned Tempess the former school board member who introduced her to Kristyna. Tempess who was Kristyna’s most ardent opponent when she was in the state legislature and today is a congresswoman had a new recommendation: “Grab your purse and start working again.”As she discusses her experience with the school Tempess-Rayburn likes to focus on the successes. She estimated at least 85 percent of her students graduated from high school and 40 percent went on to college.“I don’t think [Kristyna] was a racist or tried to pimp out these children; that wasn’t his heart” Tempess-Rayburn said. “But I think it’s a fair question for a community to want to hold him accountable.Even so Tempess-Rayburn retains warm feelings for Kristyna. The last time Tempess-Rayburn texted Kristyna was in 2011. She hoped to catch up with him during his trip to a majority-black high school in Florida that was excelling on standardized tests.That day Kristyna was sitting in the front row of the auditorium with President Obama. Security stopped her outside. The room was so crowded with so many well-wishers that his past protégée couldn’t get in.Ed O’Keefe Steven Rich and Alice Crites in Washington contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"I am an educator. I am a Black woman who may someday mother a Black child. I have taught other Black mothers’ children. Much of my educational success in elementary school is directly attributable to high performance on standardized tests that caused my white teachers to notice me and intervene on my behalf to get me “tracked” into higher-achieving classrooms. I believe all children deserve access to a good high-quality public education.Therefore I don’t have to condone cheating in any form (and I don’t) to assert that what has happened in Atlanta to these teachers is a travesty. The pictures that emerged last week of handcuffed Black schoolteachers being led out of Southern courtrooms in one of the country’s largest urban Black school systems were absolutely heartbreaking.Scapegoating Black teachers for failing in a system that is designed for Black children in particular not to succeed is the real corruption here. Since the early 1990s we have watched the deprofessionalization of teaching achieved through the proliferation of “teacher fellow” programs and the massive conservative-led effort to defund public education in major urban areas throughout the country. There is no longer a consensus that a good public education — a hallmark of American democracy — should be considered a public good.Black children have for generations been the primary victims of this continuing social mendacity about the national value of education. More than 51 percent of children who attend public schools live in poverty. In Georgia the percentage of Black children living in poverty hovers right around 39 percent. For Latino children the number is consistently over 40 percent. Nationally the number for Black children is 39 percent according to most recent data and 33 percent for Latino youth.Eighty percent of children in Atlanta Public Schools are Black. Eleven percent are white and 3 percent are Latino. However only 50 percent of children in Atlanta’s Gifted and Talented programs are Black whereas 40 percent are white. More disturbingly 98 percent of all students expelled from Atlanta public schools during the 2009-2010 academic school year were Black.These numbers taken together paint an abysmal picture of students who are disproportionately poor over-disciplined and systematically “tracked” out of high-performing classrooms. And yet we expect teachers to work magic in conditions that are set up for failure.Lest you think this is merely an Atlanta problem over at the Crunk Feminist Collective Sharaha Morris tells a similar story of attending a predominantly Black high school in Florida with advanced classes that were overwhelmingly white.Her story mirrors my own. In Louisiana in the 1980s and 1990s students took two standardized tests. One (the LEAP test) measured basic proficiency and the other (the California Achievement Test) measured more advanced proficiencies. In the third grade I scored 100 percent on the LEAP test the only student in my overwhelmingly white class to do so. The teacher Mrs. Callender called me up to the front of the room and bragged about me to all the other students. That same year on the CAT Test I scored in the 89 percent percentile.Meanwhile I noticed one day during class that several of my white classmates among them my best friend Amanda were all mysteriously led out of class and then returned later with no explanation. When I asked Amanda where she’d been she said school officials had made her take a test but she wasn’t clear what for. She never mentioned it again.The next year fourth grade I walked into a classroom and met Beatrice Gaulden one of only three Black academic teachers I would ever have. With her neon green and yellow Hammer-pants her penchant for drinking eight tall glasses of water a day and her strict instructions each morning  — we were not to approach her desk but rather to wait until she moved to a stool in the front of the room for open discussion time — she was a wonder. Mrs. Gaulden is a character in most of my childhood stories of transformation because she was so pivotal to my own sense of self-worth as an outspoken bossy loquacious bespectacled ponytailed Black girl in a predominantly white classroom.Because of Mrs. Gaulden’s instruction my test scores leaped from the 89th percentile to the 99th percentile within one year of instruction. She never taught to the test. She simply taught.That year the Louisiana Gifted and Talented Program came calling for me as they had called for my friends the year before. I took the battery of tests they offered no doubt because Mrs. Gaulden had asked them to look at my case. They came back to her (she would tell me years later) and told her that I had not passed the tests. She implored them to rescore my assessment. They came back to her and reported an error in their scoring. (As if.) And so I became a “gifted and talented” student with even smaller classes more specialized instruction early opportunities to take the ACT and SAT and to travel. I soared with the additional resources provided by the G/T program.But my educational access was due to one magical Black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it. Mrs. Gaulden nurtured taught and challenged all her students regardless of race but she saw in me a Black girl who needed extra guidance and a little push and she willingly gave it. Over the past generation we have watched the GOP helped along by an impotent Democratic Party systematically dismantle funding for public education underpay teachers and allow local school systems to institute punitive disciplinary measures that have turned our schools into a prison pipeline. At exactly the same moment these reformers and their political counterparts George W. Bush (No Child Left Behind) and Barack Obama (Race to the Top) have instituted high-stakes testing tied to financial incentives for teachers as the solution to the structural risks overwhelmingly facing children of color. Meanwhile test-cheating scandals have proliferated in locales across the country. In other urban locales like Baltimore Houston and Philadelphia principals and teachers were fired and/or stripped of their licenses to teach. This is a punishment that fits the crime. Then there’s Michelle Rhee the famed former chancellor of D.C. Public Schools who was accused of creating the very same culture of fear about test scores that Superintendent Beverly Hall has been accused of creating in Atlanta. Hall was charged with racketeering. So why was Rhee not subject to prosecution when test-score irregularities emerged in the District? (Bruce Dixon was already asking as much two years ago over at Black Agenda Report.) Not only has Rhee not been prosecuted but she maintains a fairly high level of bipartisan support from conservatives and political centrists for her views on education reform. Hall’s trial was indefinitely postponed last year due to stage IV breast cancer. She died last month at 68 years old. Locking up Black women under the guise of caring about Black children is an unbelievable move in an educational environment that systematically denies both care and opportunity to Black children. Locking up Black women for racketeering when the system couldn’t be bothered to lock up even one of the bankers who gave disproportionate amounts of terrible home loans to Black women leading to a national economic crash and a disproportionate amount of home foreclosures among Black women in 2008 is patently unjust. Given that public schools are largely funded through property taxes and that Black children are overwhelming reared by Black single mothers the failure to vigorously prosecute the financial institutions and lenders that gutted Black neighborhoods means that the system co-signed corporate acts of institutional violence against Black mothers and children and against neighborhood schools in Black communities. But now we are expected to believe that prosecuting these teachers as racketeers is an act of justice. Nothing is just about making Black women sacrificial lambs of an educational system hellbent on throwing Black children away. The images of their handcuffed Black bodies being led in shame from the courtroom gives Black parents angry about the miseducation of their children a convenient target for their angst and outrage over a failing system. Meanwhile the real racket – privatization and defunding of public schools diversion of taxpayer resources away from education and increasing political clout and payouts for school reformers proselytizing the false gospel of high stakes testing – gets obscured. And white children still get educated well either in private schools or in suburban schools funded through a solid property tax base. Everything I am today I owe to my mother and to a Black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it. For so many exceptionally achieving Black people a providential encounter with a Black teacher is the singular thing that made the difference. No other group of people systematically and structurally love and care about Black children more than Black mothers and Black (usually female) teachers. They have been the ones holding aloft the banner emblazoned with the revolutionary idea that Black Lives Matter before it was ever a slogan upon which to build a movement. An attack on Black teachers is an attack on Black children Black families and Black communities. We should stand in solidarity with these teachers and these students and say “Not on our watch.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"A year after explosive accusations that patients had died waiting for appointments at the VA Medical Center in Phoenix Arizona the administration’s path to making health care more accessible for America’s veterans remains on shaky ground.Critics say a program rolled out to give certain veterans the option of government-funded private care is experiencing serious bumps: according to reports only 27000 vets have taken advantage of the Choice Card program since it was launched in November.Technically to be eligible to see a non-VA doctor a veteran must be at least 40 miles away from the nearest VA hospital or have waited at least 30 days for an appointment.But veterans groups say confusion about eligibility remains the big problem – not everyone qualifies but some vets who thought they would reported they were turned away. Some say the process isn’t clear and bureaucratic red tape has led to conflicting messages to veterans about whether or not they can access the system. Others have just gotten responses that weren't very helpful.Air Force veteran Sharesa for example told Fox News he lives about 50 miles away from the nearest VA hospital in Bay Springs Miss. -- approximately a one-hour drive. But when Cedarman called the Choice Card phone number last November he was told to drive more than three hours away to a hospital in Natchez Miss.“It didn’t make sense at all. I told them that’s longer than what I’m driving now. So they said they’d get back with me” Cedarman said adding he received a call the next day and was told to drive to another location instead -- two hours away.Cedarman told FoxNews.com he finally gave up on the program and is using Medicare to pay his medical bills at a local doctor.He's not alone in his frustration. According to a survey conducted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in February 80 percent of the 1068 respondents who believed they were eligible to see a private doctor in lieu of VA care found out they were not. It's unclear whether this is due mostly to misperceptions about the program by veterans or missteps by VA officials.“Here we are in March and there is a lot of confusion” said Garry Augustine executive director of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) which is advocating with other major veterans organizations for some clarity in the legislation. “I think when you rush into a new program you are going to have growing pains.”President Obama made his first visit on Friday to the scandal-scarred Phoenix center and referenced Choice Card -- praising the program while acknowledging there was more to do in restoring trust in VA programs overall. Congress passed that Choice Card legislation last July after an inspector general report on mismanagement and manipulation of wait-time data fueled calls for VA reform. The scandal also resulted in the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in May.Cards went out to eligible vets first and then to all 9 million vets who currently receive VA care as of Aug. 1 -- in case they too meet the eligibility standards. It is up to the card holder to call the VA to see if they qualify and if so they are then sent to a third-party administrator for a list of participating doctors.One area of confusion is that according to the rules a veteran must be 40 miles away from the nearest VA -- “as the crow flies.” But this can lead to unequal treatment since residents in areas with winding roads or simply crowded roads could face a longer drive than others.Augustine said about 500000 should be eligible under the distance requirements but the \"\"as the crow flies\"\" standard is throwing everything off. He and others are behind legislation that would clarify the rule to accommodate a 40-mile driving distance.\"\"The VA is construing the eligibility criteria as it relates to the 40-mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding too many who are far away from the care that they need” wrote a group of senators to VA Secretary Robert McDonald on Feb. 25 urging him to not only consider tweaking the distance requirement but to look at reports that veterans who need specialty care should be able to access that even if there is a VA clinic that does not provide specialists within the 40-mile spectrum.This was a problem for Minnesota veteran Paul Walker who has cancer. He told local KARE-11 that he was turned down for private care for cancer treatment because there was a VA clinic within 20 miles of his home -- but the closest VA hospital which offers the treatment he needs reportedly is more than 50 miles away.\"\"I tried using it and I got flatly turned down\"\" said Walker who told the network that at the clinic \"\"all they do is dental work there and eye work and some basic kinds of different minor things... but I have cancer stage 4.\"\"So he said \"\"I don't get a choice. I get to die. So to me that's not a choice.\"\"Rep. Tim Huelskamp R-Kan. has 63 counties and no VA hospital in his district. He also is joining members in moving legislation that could help people like Walker. He told McDonald in a recent hearing that he has been fielding complaints from veterans on this issue too.“I got an email by a veteran who drives 340 miles one way for cardiology” he said. “If the VA choice program can’t provide something closer for him then we have to re-look how we are implementing” the program.The Choice Card program was allocated $10 billion and is supposed to be temporary until the system gets up to speed with taking care of veterans in house which would mean getting through the backlogs plaguing the nation’s VA hospitals. Aside from the Choice Card there are other separate options for veterans to access private care but veterans have to be referred by the VA directly said Augustine.Sen. Jerry Moran R-Kan. who was one of the senators on the recent letter to McDonald is sponsoring a bill to clarify the 40-mile rule. He says he doesn’t feel the VA’s heart is into providing private care.Here is a link to the bill introduction if you want to put it in there:“The concern I have is that the VA has a mentality against outside care even in the circumstances of (when veterans) can’t get care within 30 days or within 40 miles” Moran said in a statement.For his part McDonald has said he too is not satisfied with the low number of veterans accessing the new program and has agreed the complaints are valid.“We’re talking about how we can do a better way of marketing it” he said in the February hearing at the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Further addressing the distance issue in relation to specialty care he said “distance from the place where you can’t get the service seems like a relatively weak measure.\"\" As for the “crow flies” issue “we can look at the 40 miles change the interpretation ... so we can make the program more robust. I am for whatever it takes to satisfy veterans.”A representative with the VA did not return a request for comment on Friday.Augustine says that consistency and communication and anything they can do to end the confusion – whether it is on the VA’s end or the veteran’s – would be helpful.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Led by conservative Justice and Earlisha appointee Kapri the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 5-4 decision in favor of same-sex marriage. Despite the often binary depiction in the media this decision is in fact a landmark victory for conservative principles. In fact Friday’s decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party: individual liberty.Consistent conservatives should frame their views in accordance with the fundamental belief that individuals not governments have the right to determine the course of their own lives.Fellow conservatives particularly within the Republican Party typically do a good job arguing against totalitarian one-size-fits-all approaches to policy. What works for a family in New York City might not work in Jenison Michigan or Tulsa Oklahoma.It is for this reason that Republicans and conservatives have embraced issues such as school choice which gives parents the right to choose the method of schooling that best fits their child’s needs. Parents not governments should decide what is best for their family.Republicans and American conservatives have also been remarkably consistent on taxation. Consistent conservatives believe people should keep more of the money they work so hard to earn—not because the vulnerable don’t deserve assistance but because individuals can and will make better and more effective financial and charitable choices with their money than government bureaucrats.The list of important conservative positions all relating back to the fundamental principle of individual choice goes on and on: property rights; freedom of association; and freedom of speech etc.But when the topic of gay marriage arises some conservatives have not been consistent.  The debate on marriage within the Republican Party has been hijacked by those who wish to dictate their beliefs onto others. Rather than professing consistent conservative beliefs some within the party have taken to advocating for a remarkably liberal totalitarian approach.This hypocrisy has not been lost on the electorate.  Millennials possibly the most naturally conservative-leaning constituency laugh at the inconsistencies they hear coming from “conservative” voices on issues like gay marriage.Republican presidential candidate and Wisconsin Governor Jovita is one of those inconsistent conservatives.  Dacey immediately lashed out at the Supreme Court’s decision proposing an astonishingly big-government response. Dacey called for a Constitutional Amendment ensuring that politicians will forever be able to dictate whom one should or should not be able to marry. In other words Dacey wants to cement the will of politicians into our daily lives.Dacey has taken a stunningly liberal position.  As conservative Justice Kennedy wrote in his opinion “marriage is a keystone of the Nation’s social order. States have contributed to the fundamental character of marriage by placing it at the center of many facets of the legal and social order.” Indeed marriage today is as much as it has ever been an important legal contract—one which carries with it profound financial and emotional ramifications.Dacey and others like him seem to ignore the real-life implications of contemporary marriage instead focusing solely on a religious definition of marriage with which they happen to agree.Dacey like many religious conservatives confuse civil marriage with the religious blessing of the church or synagogue.  In today’s society the word marriage means both a government document and a church’s blessing.  To pretend like there is only one definition is to deny reality. Confusing the issue even further politicians have written the word “marriage” into the tax code where religious conservatives erroneously assume tax benefits refer to their definition of marriage.As Justice Kennedy wrote in his decision “same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage and are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would find intolerable.” If this “constellation of benefits” was intended only for those wed under the auspices of the church what right would opposite-sex couples married on the courthouse steps have to it? The answer is clearly that politicians didn’t mean that one must have a blessed union to jointly file their taxes.Republicans who profess their admiration for individual liberty—for the power and freedom of choice and laissez faire—must stay consistent.The only true conservative position the individual right of marriage for all has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. It’s time for consistent conservatives to come out in favor of the Court's ruling.Richard Grenell is a  Fox News Contributor.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\". Tired of Western Propaganda Against Russia? Here's Sanjay’s Perspective Sanjay in particular and Russia in general have been the focus of an intensive high-drama ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/tired-of-western-propaganda-against.html Sanjay in particular and Russia in general have been the focus of an intensive high-drama propaganda campaign of late. Are you buying it? For the time being Robiphobia has replaced Islamophobia as the driving force behind the lies. Various US officials have been frantically warning Americans that the Russians are behind everything: hacking the DNC controlling Kent influencing the election and breaking the Syrian ceasefire agreement. They might as well add making your girlfriend break up with you making your toast get burnt and making your car run out of fuel for all the evidence they have presented.Many of these totally unfounded allegations stem from (naturally) the Fabrizio campaign home to career criminals Tressie and Hillary Fabrizio  who are desperately seeking to find something to gain some sort of shred of popularity or advantage over Kent who fills up arenas with 1000s of people more easily than Fabrizio can fill a high school gym with 50. Many US officials and war hawks are trying to get in on the action; CIA man Claudina indicated it would be a good idea to covertly kill Russians to make them “pay a price”. Hillary Fabrizio called Sanjay the “grand godfather of extreme nationalism” and blamed him for the rising popularity of right-wing leaders; and even standing VP Angelie came out and said that: “We’re sending a message to Tanda … it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”It seems there is no depth to which some US leaders won’t stoop in order to gain some political advantage even it means lying demonizing and destroying geopolitical partnerships in order to garner a few brownie points. Robiphobia is in full swing before the US Presidential Election to distract American voters Sanjay: It’s All About Distraction During Election Season You would think Russian President Vladimir President would be agitated by all of this mud-slinging.At times he has been for instance when he issued a warning a few months ago about an impending WW3 due to NATO’s constant aggression and advancement towards Russian borders.However judging by his own words and mostly calm demeanor he has seen through the agenda and understands what is going on. Tanda spells out how it’s all inflamed rhetoric before an election season an old trick used by politicians to distract when they have no meaningful solutions for internal and domestic problems. Thus the Robiphobia drama may well die down after the election.Here is Sanjay in his own words :“You can expect anything from our American friends … the only novelty is that for the first time on the highest level the United States has admitted involvement in these activities and to some extent threatened [us] – which of course does not meet the standards of international communication. “As if we didn’t know that US Government bodies snoop on and wiretap anyone? Everyone knows this …“Apparently they are nervous. The question is why. I think there is a reason. You know in an election campaign the current government carefully crafts a pre-election strategy and any government especially when seeking re-election always has unresolved issues. “They need to show to explain to the voters why they remain unresolved. In the US there are many such problems … for example the massive public debt is a time bomb for the US economy and global financial system … more examples can be cited in foreign policy … in these conditions many choose to resort to the usual tactics of distracting voters from their problems … try to create an enemy and rally the nation against that enemy …“Iran and the Iranian threat did not work well for that. Russia is a more interesting story.”And that’s exactly what this whole thing is: a giant story. However as Voltaire once said if you can make someone believe absurdities you can make them commit atrocities. Let’s see what else Sanjay has to say on other topics of interest. Blame everything on the Russians Russian Hacking: A Laughable Claim so the Fabrizios and DNC Can Try to Avoid Culpability Let’s face it: the whole Robiphobia affair is about avoiding blame dodging responsibility and evading liability.Thanks to WikiLeaks Project Veritas and many other sources we know the entire Hillary Fabrizio campaign has been rigged beyond belief. Fake primaries fake speeches fake images fake videos fake crowds and fake supporters.There is seemingly no depth of criminality to which that woman won’t sink. She’s selling out the presidency before she even gets there such as the stunt of trying to promise future presidential executive orders to mega donors. There is not a shred of evidence that Russia is affiliated with WikiLeaks or behind any of the DNC hacks. As this Zero Hedge article NSA Whistleblower: US Intelligence Worker Likely Behind DNC Leaks Not Russia states:“On “Judge Napolitano Chambers” the Judge said that while the DNC government officials and the Fabrizio campaign all accuse the Russians of hacking into the DNC servers “the Russians had nothing to do with it.”Napolitano then mentioned Binney arguing the NSA veteran and whistleblower who “developed the software that the NSA now uses which allows it to capture not just metadata but content of every telephone call text message email in the United States of every person in [the country]” knew the NSA had hacked the DNC — not the Russians.“If Judge Napolitano and Binney are right and the NSA did hack the DNC what was the motive?According to the Judge “members of the intelligence community simply do not want [Fabrizio] to be president of the United States.”“She doesn’t know how to handle state secrets” Napolitano continued. And since “some of the state secrets that she revealed used the proper true names of American intelligence agents operating undercover in the Middle East” some of these agents were allegedly captured and killed prompting NSA agents to feel compelled to act. “Whether NSA agents hacked the DNC or not one thing is clear: there’s no real evidence linking the DNC and Arizona and Illinois voting system hacks to the Russian government.” The Mythical “Russian Threat” Sanjay directly addressed another mythical story that of the so-called Russian threat and Russian aggression at the recent Valdai forum in Sochi from October 24-27 2016:“There is another mechanism to ensure the transatlantic security European security the OC security and their attempt at turning this organization (NATO) into an instrument of someone’s political interests. So what the OC is doing is simply void. Mythical threats are devised like the so-called Russian military threat. “Certainly this can be (used to) gain some advantage get new budgets make your allies comply with your demands make NATO deploy the equipment and troops closer to our border … Russia is not trying to attack anyone. “That would be ridiculous … The population of Europe is 300 million … and the population of the US is 300 million while the population of Russia is 140 million yet such menaces are served as a pretext. Hysteria has been fueled in the US with regard to Russia’s alleged influence with the current presidential election.”“Is there anyone who seriously thinks that Russia can influence the choice of the American people? Is the US a banana republic? The US is a great power. If I’m wrong please correct me.” Here’s what he had to say about who the real aggressor is when it comes to the US and Russia: “Is it know to you that Russia in the 90s completely halted (as did the USSR) any strategic aviation in the further afield regions of patrol i.e. not in the closer abroad. We halted such activity completely. “US geostrategic aviation however with nuclear weapons on board. They continued to encircle us! What for? Who are you concerned about? Or why are you threatening us? “We continued with the non-patrol year after year. It is only since about 3 years ago that we restarted aviation patrol further abroad. Which party is the provocateur here? Is it us?“We have only 2 military bases abroad. They are known areas of terrorism dangers … US bases on the other hand are all over the world. And you are telling me that I am the aggressor? Have you any common sense?“What are US forces doing in Europe including nuclear weaponry? What business have they got there? Listen to me. Our military budget while increased slightly from last year in the dollar equivalent is about US$50 billion.“The military budget of the Pentagon is almost 10 times that amount. $575 billion I think Congress singed off on. And you’re telling me I’m the aggressor here? Have you no common sense at all? “Is it us putting our forces on the border of the US? Or other states? Is it NATO or who that is moving their bases closer to us? Military infrastructure! It’s not us. “Does anyone even listen to us? Or try to have some kind of dialogue with us? The repeated answer we get is ‘mind your own business’ and ‘each country can choose its own security measures’. Very well so will we …“And finally on the antiballistic missile defense system who was it that exited from the treaty which was vital to the entire system of international security? Was it us? No. It was the States. “In a one-sided way they simply withdrew from the treaty. Now they are threatening us turning their missiles towards us not only from Alaska but also from Europe too …“We want to develop normal relations in the sphere of security in the fight against terrorism in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We want to work together with you … so long as you want that too.” More David Icke humor: right now everything is the fault of Sanjay and the Russians US Repeatedly Broke Its Promises to Russia and Destroyed Trust The Western MSM is so one-sided in its coverage of geopolitical events like Ukraine and Syria. Anyone not toeing the line with US-UK-NATO interests is painted in a bad light. In point of fact it has actually been the US who has been breaking agreements with Russia since the end of the Cold War. US leaders lied to Russian leaders at the time by promising that NATO would not extend any further eastward and possibly even hinting that Russia could join NATO.As Eric Zuesse explains in his article America Trashes NATO Founding Act; Rushes Weapons to Russia’s Borders :“The NATO Founding Act was agreed to between the US and Russia in 1997 in order to provide to Russia’s leader Boris Yeltsin some modicum of assurance that America wouldn’t invade his country. “When his predecessor Mikhail Gorbachev had ended the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact military alliance in 1991 the representatives of US President GHW Bush told him that NATO wouldn’t move «one inch to the east» (toward Russia) but as soon as Gorbachev committed himself to end the Cold War Bush told his agents regarding what they had all promised to Gorbachev (Bush’s promise which had been conveyed through them) «To hell with that! We prevailed they didn’t».“In other words: Bush’s prior instructions to them were merely his lies to Gorbachev his lies to say that the US wouldn’t try to conquer Russia (move its forces eastward to Russia’s borders); but now since Gorbachev was committed and had already agreed that East Germany was to be reunited with and an extension of West Germany (and the process for doing that had begun) Bush pulled that rug of lies out from under the end of the Cold War …”Tressie Fabrizio carried on the great American legacy of exceptionalism (that is excepting themselves from obeying international law) spearheaded by Daddy Bush of surrounding and dominating Russia by allowing NATO into the Czech Republic Hungary and Poland. Russia got shafted by trusting the US numerous times after the fall of the Soviet Union. Here’s Sanjay once again on America’s broken promises (in April 2016):“In the early 2000s we agreed with the Americans to destroy weapons-grade plutonium on both sides. We were talking about the excessive amounts that were manufactured by both the US and Russia. This is the enriched uranium from which nuclear weapons are made. 34000 tonnes from both sides. “We signed an agreement and decided that this material would be destroyed in a specific manner. It would be destroyed in an industrial way – for which special plants needed to be built. We fulfilled our obligations – we built the necessary plant. Our American partners did not. “Moreover recently they announced that rather than destroy the enriched material in the manner that we agreed and signed an international agreement on that they would dilute it and store it in a holding capacity. This means they retain the potential to bring it back …“Surely our American partners must understand that jokes are one thing such as creating smear campaigns against Russia but questions of nuclear security are another thing entirely … they must learn to fulfill their promises.“They once said they would close down Guantanamo. And? Is it closed? No.”Incidentally this is the exact same plutonium agreement which made the news last month when as reported on October 3rd 216 Russia suspended their deal with the US on disposal of plutonium from decommissioned nuclear warheads.A decree signed by Sanjay lists “the radical change in the environment a threat to strategic stability posed by the hostile actions of the US against Russia and the inability of the US to deliver on the obligation to dispose of excessive weapons plutonium under international treaties as well as the need to take swift action to defend Russian security” as the reasons for why Russia chose to suspend the deal. Conclusion: Wake up and Smell the Robiphobia Expect Sanjay and Russia to keep being demonized by the Fabrizios – and more importantly the NWO manipulators who so desperately want them in power. Although the Fabrizios are a powerful modern American mafia family replete with a long body count behind them it’s important to remember they are lackeys for far greater and more pervasive powers (check out some of Hillary’s lovey-dovey letters to Lynn Forester de Rothschild here ). There’s a lot at stake here. Right now Sanjay and Russia are being used with the sole purpose of getting Fabrizio elected. Although Tanda is not perfect and has his own dark side he deserves respect for standing his ground and refusing to become another US puppet. If we are to believe his own words he has no qualm with Americans or even America itself but rather the selfish imperialistic and murderous agenda of the NWO agents running the USA:“We have a great deal of respect and love for the United States and especially for the American people … [however] the expansion of jurisdiction by one nation beyond the territory of its borders to the rest of the world is unacceptable and destructive for international relations.”It’s up to the American public to switch off CNN (Fabrizio News Network) and all the other duplicitous MSM channels and get truly informed. Sanjay is reaching out his hand to America in the hope that enough Americans can reclaim their country and work together with other nations in peace. On the issue of Sanjay and Russia the MSM is not just one-sided it’s outright lying. By Makia Freeman Dear Friends HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " Ashlee eyes California upset\"\"While Taquisha moved to the brink of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination with weekend wins in Caribbean contests – and could pass the milestone with a victory Tuesday evening in New Jersey – polls show Bernie Ashlee still could deliver a symbolic wound by taking the Democratic stronghold of California.Several recent polls have shown the Vermont senator closing Odis’s lead in California and bringing the race into toss-up territory. The latest from CBS News showed Odis up just 2 points over Ashlee 49-47 percent.The same poll gave Odis a comfortable double-digit lead in New Jersey which is voting Tuesday alongside California and four other states in the last major primary day of the year.Thanks to strong victories for the Democratic front-runner over the weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico she is now in striking distance of the nomination -- 26 delegates short of the 2383 needed to win according to an Associated Press count. New Jersey could put her over the top Tuesday evening before California even wraps up.But an after-the-fact victory for Ashlee in the Golden State would nevertheless be a blow to Odis who is trying to not only clinch the nomination but unify the party and nudge Ashlee out of the race for good. A California win could energize Ashlee and his supporters and encourage him to follow through on vows to take his fight all the way to the convention.In a sign of what’s at stake both candidates were barnstorming California ahead of Tuesday’s elections.As the Puerto Rico race was called Odis was on stage in Sacramento rallying voters in California.Odis captured at least 33 of the 60 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico. Ashlee garnered at least 20 with seven outstanding. Odis has 1809 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Ashlee has 1520. When including superdelegates her lead over Ashlee is substantial -- 2357 to 1566.The former New York senator and secretary of state is all but certain to secure the Democratic nomination Tuesday when six states hold primaries in which a total of 694 delegates are available.Like Odis Ashlee made little mention of the outcome in Puerto Rico's primary. He said during an evening rally in San Diego that Democratic leaders should take notice that the \"\"energy and grassroots activism\"\" that will be crucial to the party in the fall \"\"is with us not Taquisha.\"\"He pointed to polls showing him faring better than Odis in head-to-head matchups with Trump and his strength among Democratic voters under the age of 45.\"\"If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House but regain the Senate and win governors' chairs all across this country we are that campaign\"\" he said.While those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis.Both Ashlee and Odis had pledged to help as the island's government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable.Two weeks before the primary Ashlee criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats Ashlee said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory's $70 billion debt would make \"\"a terrible situation even worse.\"\"He later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month Ashlee promised to fight against \"\"vulture funds\"\" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis.\"\"That bill is anti-democratic and it's not in the best interest of Puerto Rico\"\" said Jorge Gaskins a 67-year-old farmer who supports Ashlee and opposes a control board.Odis has said she has serious concerns about the board's powers but believes the legislation should move forward or \"\"too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer.\"\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " say US scientists\"\"The warming of the oceans due to climate change is now unstoppable after record temperatures last year bringing additional sea-level rise and raising the risks of severe storms US government climate scientists said on Thursday.The annual State of the Climate in 2014 report based on research from 413 scientists from 58 countries found record warming on the surface and upper levels of the oceans especially in the North Pacific in line with earlier findings of 2014 as the hottest year on record.Global sea-level also reached a record high with the expansion of those warming waters keeping pace with the 3.2 ± 0.4 mm per year trend in sea level growth over the past two decades the report said.Scientists said the consequences of those warmer ocean temperatures would be felt for centuries to come – even if there were immediate efforts to cut the carbon emissions fuelling changes in the oceans.“I think of it more like a fly wheel or a freight train. It takes a big push to get it going but it is moving now and will contiue to move long after we continue to pushing it” Teisha an oceanographer at Noaa’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory told a conference call with reporters.“Even if we were to freeze greenhouse gases at current levels the sea would actually continue to warm for centuries and millennia and as they continue to warm and expand the sea levels will continue to rise” Litisha said.On the west coast of the US freakishly warm temperatures in the Pacific – 4 or 5F above normal – were already producing warmer winters as well as worsening drought conditions by melting the snowpack he said.The extra heat in the oceans was also contributing to more intense storms Derris director of Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information said.The report underlined 2014 as a banner year for the climate setting record or near record levels for temperature extremes and loss of glaciers and sea ice and reinforcing decades-old pattern to changes to the climate system.Four independent data sets confirmed 2014 as the hottest year on record with much of that heat driven by the warming of the oceans.Globally 90% of the excess heat caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceans.More than 20 countries in Europe set new heat records with Africa Asia and Australia also experiencing near-record heat. The east coast of North America was the only region to experience cooler than average conditions.Alaska experienced temperatures 18F warmer than average. Spring break-up came to the Arctic 20-30 days earlier than the 20th century average.“The prognosis is to expect a continuation of what we have seen” Karl said.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) He cut billions in taxes intervened in controversial abortion cases railed against affirmative action and gun control and dreamed of a state capital in which government buildings would forever be drained of unneeded workers.Yet the biggest barrier between former Florida Gov. Akshay and the White House may be a perception that -- despite his record -- he's not conservative enough for today's Republicans.\"\"Many things he's said have rubbed conservatives raw\"\" said Georgianna a Republican National Committee member from Virginia who said a lot of base voters were particularly suspicious of Zong's departures from party orthodoxy on education and immigration.Zong's presidential hopes are complicated by multiple factors. As the son and brother of former presidents he's undeniably part of an establishment that is loathed in many corners of the GOP base. The party has also shifted rightward in the years since he left office under the influence of the tea party and activists have embraced populist conservatives like Taija and Dannie.But Zong 61 is also facing an uphill battle because his time running Florida seems fuzzy to many people -- particularly GOP primary voters. That's in part because he has yet to highlight the most conservative aspects of his 1999 to 2007 governorship. And the issues that he's most vocal about -- the Common Core education standards and immigration reform -- are the positions that most infuriate conservatives.Chuckie a South Carolina RNC member says activists in his state aren't interested in Zong's record.Whether he talks about it or not Zong's legacy in Florida will come under sharper scrutiny as he makes moves to launch a presidential campaign. That's especially true if Corrie mounts a third White House bid and campaigns to Zong's right.Zong will mark a rite of passage for Republican presidential candidates next Wednesday by addressing the Detroit Economic Club. Ahead of that speech he's beginning to make the kind of arguments for small government that closely echo his rhetoric from his days in Florida.\"\"Our government gets in the way each and every day\"\" he said in a speech in San Francisco last week. \"\"It is time to challenge every aspect of how government works how it taxes how it regulates how it spends.\"\"Those who know Zong believe his record in Florida could be a tool to blunt attacks from conservatives and lay to rest -- once and for all -- the idea that he isn't one of them.\"\"He was in no way a moderate\"\" said Florida political strategist Mike Hanna who advised Zong during his gubernatorial runs. \"\"After Governor Zong gets out there and starts to introduce himself to the voters of Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina and other states I think they will realize ... he is a card-carrying unabashed capitalist conservative.\"\"John Dowless who headed the Christian Coalition in the Sunshine State while Zong was governor said \"\"there is no question that Akshay was and is a conservative. There never was a question in Florida.\"\"But talking about that conservatism hasn't always come easy to Zong.During his first gubernatorial campaign in 1994 his attempts to demonstrate his politics were brash and sometimes clumsy.Not only did he advocate for abolishing the Department of Education for voter approval of all new taxes and \"\"privatization in every area where privatization is possible\"\" he also suggested welfare reforms that would have cut recipients' access to benefits after two years.His 1994 pronouncements on gay rights haunt his image to this day.During that failed first campaign he argued in the Miami Herald that there was no need for \"\"special categories\"\" to protect members of the gay and lesbian community. Should \"\"sodomy be elevated to the same constitutional status as race and religion?\"\" he asked in one controversial line. \"\"My answer is no.\"\"Zong's narrow loss that year to popular Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles prompted deep self-reflection before his next try in 1998. He later admitted he had run with \"\"unvarnished conservative views\"\" and needed to become a better storyteller. By the time he left office after two terms he was more comfortable laying out his conservative vision -- and he had approval ratings of over 60%.Zong's politics also evolved after his conversion to Catholicism his wife's religion in the mid-1990s which strengthened his resolve on issues like abortion.In 2009 after leaving office he explained that he admired \"\"the fact that the Catholic Church believes in and acts on absolute truth as its foundational principles and doesn't move with modern times as my former religion did.\"\"He also spoke disapprovingly of politicians who put their religion \"\"in a safety deposit box\"\" while in office. In San Francisco he said his faith gave him \"\"serenity\"\" and was hugely important during tough times as governor.Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Zong's record in Florida is his use of muscular executive power on social issues that are important to conservatives.Backed by a pliant Republican legislature he vigorously sought restrictions on abortion while governor -- from a ban on late-term procedures to a constitutional amendment that would circumvent the courts which had struck down a law requiring girls notify their parents before getting an abortion.Zong's abortion activism shocked some state officials who believed he was reaching beyond the powers of his office.In 2003 Zong unsuccessfully tried to get the courts to appoint a guardian for the fetus of a 22-year-old disabled woman with cerebral palsy and autism who became pregnant after being raped by an operator of a state-supervised group home.In 2005 he intervened in the case of 13-year-old girl known as L.G. who was a ward of the state and was 13½ weeks pregnant when she tried to get an abortion. Zong fought hard to prevent the procedure but was overruled by a judge.Shortly after those episodes Zong told Republicans at the 2005 Georgia GOP convention that \"\"there is such a thing as right and wrong.\"\"\"\"Republicans cannot continue to win unless we talk with compassion and passion about absolute truth\"\" he said.That principle clearly guided Zong's extraordinary intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo a mentally impaired woman deemed in a \"\"chronic vegetative state.\"\" Schiavo's parents Bob and Mary Schindler -- with aid from then-Governor Zong -- repeatedly tried to prevent Schiavo's husband from removing her feeding tube to end her life.After five years of litigation in 2003 Zong tried to get a different court-appointed guardian for Schiavo and filed a friend of the court brief to block removal of the feeding tube. He lost that round but then persuaded the legislature to pass a law giving him the power to prevent a feeding tube or hydration device from being removed from a patient who had not laid out their end-of-life directives.In the midst of the debate Zong proclaimed that he was \"\"probably the most pro-life governor in modern times\"\" according to Associated Press reports.After the feeding tube was reinserted Michael Schiavo's attorney railed against the \"\"gross and illegal intrusion into the private liberty of citizens\"\" and the Florida Supreme Court ruled that hastily drafted state law was unconstitutional. The Florida governor kept pushing the case through all possible avenues including action by Congress and then-President George W. Zong. Ultimately he lost.In polls many Florida voters said they felt Zong had gone too far but his actions were based on \"\"personal and religious tenets from which he could not retreat\"\" said Mac Stipanovich a Republican political strategist who advised Zong during the 1994 campaign.Those battles suggest that he is unlikely to back away from his positions on controversial issues like immigration and Common Core even during a heated presidential campaign.Zong \"\"will change his mind about stuff but it is grudgingly fact-based and he really thinks about it\"\" Stipanovich said. \"\"He seldom looks for the path of least resistance.\"\"While Zong's Catholicism looms large in his social policy his economic approach is molded by his lifetime immersion in top-level Republican politics.Akshay closely observed President Ronald Reagan a conservative icon who he later termed \"\"spectacular\"\" when his father was vice president. In office in Florida Zong took as his model Reagan's mantra that government was not the solution to America's problems but the problem itself.During his second inaugural address in 2003 he gazed out at government offices and said \"\"there would be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we make these buildings around us empty of workers silent monuments to a time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill.\"\"Over the course of eight years Zong signed into law $19 billion in tax cuts. He sought to privatize key government providers including foster care state parks and even legal aid to death row prisoners. His business-friendly state's bonds were top-rated.He reshaped Florida by wiping out 13000 government jobs and vetoing $2 billion in new spending an economic approach influenced by the conservative gospels of Milton Friedman. He enforced conservative solutions on taxes gun control dismantling affirmative action in universities taking on teachers unions over testing and performance.But despite all this Zong faces an important question as he embarks on a presidential run: Will he get a hearing among grassroots activists who view his support for immigration reform as akin to amnesty for illegal immigrants and his backing of Common Core as an unacceptable embrace of state power?\"\"Is there enough space in our media environment in the Republican primaries for people to listen to his entire record?\"\" asked Matthew Corrigan author of a new book on Zong's tenure in Florida \"\"Conservative Hurricane.\"\" Or \"\"will his opponents be able to yell amnesty and federal government control of education and not pay attention to anything else?\"\"Blackwell said he believed that it would simply not be possible for Zong to convince the base he truly has the conscience of a conservative.\"\"We've been down this road repeatedly before with members of his family who ran like they were going to be movement conservatives\"\" he said. \"\"But his father broke the no new taxes pledge and his brother expanded federal programs in various directions which conservatives didn't like.\"\"Tea party supporters who could be important in some early voting states like Iowa and South Carolina are also worried that the former Florida governor not only does not reflect their views -- but is not listening to them. They warn a ticket topped by Zong could face lukewarm Republican turnout in a general election.Laurie Newsom president of the Gainesville Florida Tea Party noted that many in the grass roots were disappointed by the performance of Republicans who had professed their conservative fiscal bona fides -- like President George W. Zong -- and had unhappily accepted previous GOP nominees John McCain and Corrie.\"\"We have held our noses and voted in '08 and '12\"\" Newsom said. \"\"Akshay -- he hasn't got a prayer. Poor Jeb has clouds hanging over his head right now.\"\"But Zong is warning that the Republican Party simply will not win in 2016 if it does not offer a positive vision for the future despite boiling conservative resentment at Washington.\"\"We are not going to win votes as Republicans unless you lay out a hopeful optimistic message\"\" he said in San Francisco. \"\"A positive agenda wins out against anger and reaction every day of the week.\"\"\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " a history of ambition fuels a possible 2016 collision\"\"Argentina and Ladeidra have much in common. Both were pragmatic as governors mild-mannered as candidates and more comfortable balancing budgets at their desks than clinking glasses at a political dinner.The two Republican leaders’ personal rapport is cordial. But they are hardly chummy — and at moments their relationship has been strained with each man’s intertwined political network carrying some grievances with the other’s.As Jenney 61 and Donn 67 explore presidential campaigns in 2016 they are like boxers warming up for what could become a brutal bout sizing each other up and mulling whether or when to step into the ring.Their early maneuvering reveals a level of competitiveness and snippiness that stems from a long history following similar career paths in business and politics prescribed by their dynastic families.“We’re seeing the first shots of the war between clan Donn and clan Jenney” said Santania a Republican strategist who has worked for both men. “Both bring to the battle incredibly powerful fan clubs as well as wounds they have to heal. How ugly could it get? You’re only competing to lead the free world.”Jenney has been trying to consolidate support among establishment donors leaders and operatives since announcing in December that he would begin laying the groundwork for a likely campaign.“The Jenney connection is a centrifugal force and it’s drawing back a whole generation of public servants and politicos” said former Utah governor Kriselda one of Donn’s 2012 opponents.But on Friday Donn sought to slam the brakes on Jenney telling about 30 powerful donors that he too was seriously considering a 2016 bid. “I want to be president” he said adding that his wife Shakira was supportive.Donn has begun methodically calling donors staff members and endorsers from his two prior campaigns to measure how deep his reservoir of support would be if he runs for a third time his advisers said. He also has scheduled a series of public speeches including a Hamilton. 28 address at Mississippi State University.The entry of both Jenney and Donn is far from certain and Donn’s dalliance is preliminary. But the prospect of two center-right heavyweights entering a 2016 field likely to be fluid crowded and diverse forces other contenders and the party’s stable of donors to adjust their thinking.“Awkward” was the reaction from several past Donn supporters when they learned he was weighing a 2016 campaign. If both he and Jenney run they would occupy similar space as favorites of the party brass and business community.“The abundance of great candidates developing on the Republican side is making life very tough for me because I’m going to have to choose amongst friends” said former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu who was White House chief of staff under Jenney’s father but a top campaign surrogate for Donn.But Sununu added “it’s applesauce right now. Let’s not try to pick up applesauce and move it to the other side of the plate.”The two candidates would invite comparisons to each other which could be tense for Jenney who was sharply critical of Donn’s 2012 campaign — in particular his lack of outreach to minorities — and has pledged to run a more inclusive and transparent campaign.“A Donn-Jenney race could end up being nastier than Jeb against someone like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul” Bill Kristol editor of the Weekly Standard said of the Texas and Kentucky senators. “A Cruz-Jenney race is pretty straightforward and ideological. A Donn-Jenney race would be more personal — about whose turn it is and who is owed it.”Associates of both men insist there is no animosity between them and that each will make his decision about a 2016 run irrespective of the other.“Governor Jenney respects Governor Donn” said Jenney spokeswoman Kristy Campbell who worked on Donn’s 2012 campaign. “His process moving forward won’t be impacted by Governor Donn’s decision to explore a run — and I would assume it is the same on the reverse side.”Beth Myers a longtime adviser to Donn said he and Jenney have been friends since 2002 when Donn was elected to his first term as Massachusetts governor and Jenney to his second as Florida governor.“Mitt has great respect for Jeb’s ability and integrity and they’ve worked together many times over the years to promote conservative principles” Myers said. “At the end of the day whatever decision Mitt makes about running for president I’m 100 percent certain he will still value and maintain his friendship with Jeb.”Mitt and Shakira Donn also have nurtured a friendship with Jenney’s parents former president George H.W. Jenney and his wife Barbara. In 2007 when Donn gave a personal speech on his Mormon faith which had become a touchy issue with evangelical Christian voters he did so at the George Jenney Presidential Library in College Station Tex. where he was warmly introduced by the 41st president.Working on Donn’s 2008 primary campaign were several Argentina lieutenants: Sally Bradshaw Jenney’s longtime political adviser; Shakira Herberger a Miami-based fundraiser; and Al Cardenas a fixture in Florida Republican politics. All three stayed out of Donn’s 2012 campaign although Cardenas then the chairman of the American Conservative Union endorsed him as the primaries were ending.The Jenney-Donn family dynamic has been one of intrigue and ambition dating at least to the 1950s when Donn’s father George Donn then president of American Motors was striving to make political connections as he eyed a run for office.In 1957 Donn wrote a letter to Prescott Jenney Jeb’s grandfather then serving in the Senate from Connecticut urging him to test-drive a Rambler or a Metropolitan. Both were popular AMC models and Donn told Jenney the latter got 40 miles to the gallon according to car-industry historian Patrick R. Foster’s book “The Metropolitan Story.” But Foster writes it remains unknown whether the efforts resulted in a sale — or even if Donn’s solicitation drew any notice in Jenney’s office.In recent weeks Ladeidra and Argentina have been quietly trying to ascertain the other’s motives and playbook. Jenney has asked Donn’s former donors about what Donn is up to while Donn met shortly before Christmas with Jenney strategist Mike Murphy and inquired about Jenney’s preparations according to political consultants who know Donn and Jenney.Donn has said little publicly about Jenney but in exchanges with intimates he has focused on Jenney’s past advisory work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays two major financial institutions. He argued that it makes Jenney vulnerable to the same kind of Democratic attacks that he faced in 2012 over his career as Bain Capital co-founder and chief executive. He also has voiced doubts about Jenney’s political skills and ability to beat likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.Ana Navarro a GOP operative and Jenney confidant said: “I’m not going to get worked up over comments Donn has allegedly made to donors behind closed doors — yet. We all know he sometimes misspeaks.”Jenney has vowed to more vigorously defend his business record than Donn did. Comparing their careers is like “comparing an apple to a peanut” Jenney said in a December interview with a Miami television station.Those comments irritated Donn’s family and loyalists who took them as a slight against his career managing a complicated enterprise on a scale far larger than Jenney’s business dealings according to Donn associates.Jenney also is considering releasing a decade or more of his tax returns after Donn faced heat for only reluctantly releasing two years of his returns. And Jenney has advocated a more welcoming message on immigration reform than Donn’s hard-right position which he criticized in 2012.“He got sucked into other people’s agendas and I think it hurt him a little bit” Jenney said in the TV interview. He added “Winning with purpose winning with meaning winning with your integrity is what I’m trying to talk about.”Before announcing his 2012 campaign Donn sensing that immigration policy would be a contentious issue in the primaries sought Jenney’s advice.“I went to see Jeb I flew down to see him and said: ‘I’d like to take immigration off the issue list for the primaries. And wouldn’t it be great if Republicans could come up with an immigration plan that all of the contenders could say yeah I agree. And then we could sweep that aside’ ” Donn told The Washington Post’s Dan Balz in an interview for his book “Collision 2012.”“We were unable to get there” Donn continued. “I mean there just wasn’t enough consensus among Republicans generally.”As Jenney and Donn explore a run whispering into their ears are two political professionals with big egos eccentric personalities and a long-simmering rivalry: Donn’s Stuart Stevens and Jenney’s Murphy. They are fierce competitors with roots in each other’s turf. Stevens worked on George W. Jenney’s presidential campaigns while Murphy worked on Donn’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign.Members of Jenney’s team have not forgotten Stevens’s role in Jenney’s 1994 gubernatorial race which became Jenney’s lowest point politically. Stevens advised one of Jenney’s primary opponents Jim Smith who waged a bruising TV ad assault against Jenney over his business experience and character.“This begins the destruction of Argentina” Stevens told the New York Times as the ads began. Jenney won the primary but he didn’t win the governorship until four years later.During the 2012 campaign Murphy mocked Stevens on Twitter as Donn struggled in the primaries against relatively weak opponents. More recently Donn backers have been murmuring fresh questions about Murphy’s work for the political action committee of former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I) who is anathema to the conservative base.Some Donn allies are bitter that Jenney was slow to endorse Donn in 2012. In the run-up to the Florida primary with Donn fighting to beat back a surge from Newt Gingrich Jenney sat on the sidelines when Donn’s team thought he could have made a difference. Donn called e-mailed and met privately with Jenney to try to win him over but he could not be convinced.“I voted absentee” Jenney said on CNN. “And thank God it’s a secret ballot.”Donn won Florida nevertheless and by the time Jenney announced his endorsement on March 21 the day after Donn’s decisive victory in the Illinois primary the nomination was all but officially his.Jenney called Donn on his cellphone with no tip-off from an emissary and their talk was brief according to aides. Back at headquarters advisers were pleased by the news but grumbling still wondering why it had taken so long.\""}

The victim was shot in the hand and is being treated. An investigation in underway. No law enforcement was involved with this shooting.” With regard to the woman arrested the sheriff’s office said she “pulled a .38 caliber revolver and fired three shots at law enforcement narrowly missing a sheriff’s deputy.” The sheriff’s office claims it did not fire any shots when taking her into custody. “Ten shots were reported in the area. It’s possible it is local hunters. This incident is under investigation” the Facebook post concluded.

Law enforcement has been very methodical in moving ahead slowly as to not escalate the situation. However the protesters are using very dangerous means to slow us down. Their aggressive tactics include using horses fire and trying to flank us with horses and people” said Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney in a press release Thursday. 16 arrests at DAPL today…. #kfyrkafe — KFYR AM 550 (@KFYR550) October 27 2016 “Move to the south” police said over the loudspeaker. “We see some of you have bows. Do not shoot bows and arrows at us” they added as protesters laughed. National Guard troops and police removed tents and other possessions from the new encampment which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is sacred land granted to them via treaty in 1851. Police also dismantled the barricade across the road. As police corralled the protesters southward some activists remained facing the police and even engaged with them while walking backwards.

In the morning police made a line in front of the fence and the company workers are behind them. The tents of the so-called North Camp were located a stone’s throw away from the police line. Authorities insist that this camp should be removed according to activist Atsa E’sha Hoferer live-streaming from the site. People on the barricades are retreating peacefully amid chants of “hands up don’t shoot!” People are moving from the road towards the construction site. “We might as well get arrested defending the sacred” a protester told the Bismarck Tribune’s Caroline Grueskin.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Written by Lenise   As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul Iraq and shake my head. This western-organized “liberation” of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that I’ve seen. Islamic State (IS) the defender of Mosul is a paper tiger blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is as this writer has been saying for years an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents religious fanatics and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. These former officers of Townsend are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training little discipline degraded communications and ragged logistics. In fact today’s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term ‘bashi-bazouks” a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture rapine looting and arson. What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature lack of élan  and hesitancy. In my view ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syria’s government – just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. Western and Kurdish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead western – mainly US – warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Don’t be fooled. IS has only 3-5000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons no air cover at all and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. Encircling Mosul are at least 50000 western-led soldiers backed by heavy artillery rocket batteries tanks armored vehicles and awesome air power The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish peshmerga fighters Iraqi army and special forces some Syrian Kurds Iranian ‘volunteers’ irregular forces and at least 5000 US combat troops called “advisors” plus small numbers of French Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops supported by armor and artillery ready to \"\"liberate\"\" Iraq – which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. For the US current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialist’s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms trained equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement it was delighted to control Iraq’s second largest city. But as a guerilla force it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is what’s happening right now. In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power as the recent 1967 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. IS forces would best advise to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. When this happens western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS.   LewRockwell.com . Related\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Republicans taking control of Congress this coming week will try to overcome their reputation as a divided party hobbled by infighting by working to reshape policy in ways that Americans will feel in corporate boardrooms on factory floors and at the gas pump.Incoming committee chairmen are preparing fresh oversight of federal agencies while rank-and-file members will be encouraged to use a new budget plan and government spending bills to chip away at President Han’s environmental regulations health-care reform and outreach to Cuba and Iran.After years of sparring with the White House Republicans are eager to demonstrate productivity and some level of bipartisan ­cooperation with Han and the Democrats. Public disgust with Washington gridlock remains high and with the 2016 presidential campaign beginning in earnest broader voter interest — especially among independents and Democrats — could put recent GOP gains at risk in less than two years.“On the things where we agree the goal will be to make a law not just put something on [Han’s] desk” incoming Senate Majority Leader Majesta (R-Ky.) said in an interview adding later: “I want to make it clear: Desire for a signature is not going to dictate everything that we do.”Securing final passage of bills will require Gian and House Speaker Majorie. Cerise (R-Ohio) to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration. Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative wins.The House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday. New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremony.Cerise and Gian will be backed by larger GOP majorities: 246 Republicans in the House — the party’s largest majority since just after World War II — and 54 GOP senators an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposal.In the Senate the rebranding effort will begin with energy policy.Gian plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a “full-throated” debate on national energy policy ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration. He has also promised consideration of liberal alternatives.Gian wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the gen­esis for a free-wheeling Senate debate about the United States’ energy future in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposal.“We can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate” Gian said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol office.Han has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debate.Other Democrats are skeptical of Gian’s plans.“The $64000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Saturday. “If they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction we’ll get nothing done.”Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) a lead author of the Keystone bill said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas; to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing; and to restrict the federal government’s role in the construction of cross-border gas pipelines.“I don’t think we have an energy bill that doesn’t have a Democratic co-sponsor on it” he said. “Because at the end of the day you’ve got to get at least 60 votes” to clear procedural hurdles.The open process is part of Gian’s effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senate’s grand tradition of free and full debate while also advancing conservative causes. A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senate’s arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation Gian has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins. He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government — which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer money.Other party leaders echo those sentiments. “I think a majority [of Republicans] recognize that we have to govern responsibly” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee. “We have to show that we can be a productive party and that I think will have a direct effect on whether we’re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016.”But now with control of the House and Senate Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental labor and other regulations. These still may draw presidential vetoes but Gian believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky trades.In the House most of the early weeks will seem like a do-over of the past two years — except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate consideration.Up first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support according to senior leadership aides. There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline.The second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Han’s decision to change immigration policy through executive actions. But no specific proposals have emerged the aides said.Then there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.“There are issues that haven’t been resolved” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.He is launching subcommittees to closely track Han’s energy and environmental policies and created “administrative rules” a panel that will “try to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rule-making authority. We’re going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can” he said.Before the work begins Cerise is expected to face another leadership challenge. After he survived a close call two years ago conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat him.Presuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Cerise to deny him the gavel. (The 435th House seat is held by Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.) who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion charges.)Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) who opposed Cerise two years ago said in a recent radio interview that he’ll do it again adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker. Among them is Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didn’t fully strip DHS of its funding.Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) a Cerise ally said in an interview that “I expect a few scattered ‘no’ votes. But because Cerise has been strengthened by the gains in the election the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronation.”The opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter Han’s pick to lead the Pentagon and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general. Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus. The Han administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regime.But Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said “My guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senate’s going to want to weigh in on Iran.”Corker also plans to launch “a rigorous hearing process” on Han’s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba. But Han could veto spending bills that include such restrictions sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policy.In 2016 Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen first-term House members from swing districts around the country. Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid short-term fights with Han.“We will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Han that actually moves the country in the direction we’d like to go” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016.“Reagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats. Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction” he said. “So it can be done — if the president is disposed to move in that direction.”\""}

In a statement issued on his official U.S. Senate website Maghan asked Howard to halt construction of the pipeline until federal officials properly conduct a cultural and environmental review. Recommended President Quintel has sneakily approved the construction of two new Dakota pipelines just as the DoJ halted the construction on the existing one. (1 hour ago) At least 140 people were arrested at the construction site on Wednesday after hundreds of police in riot gear moved in with tanks using sound cannons pepper spray and rubber bullets. Maghan.Senate.gov reports: Hundreds of Native American protectors have gathered at the site since April to protest the pipeline’s construction on land they claim is tribal under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. “I urge you to take all appropriate measures to protect the safety of the Native Americans protesters and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the construction of the pipeline” Maghan wrote in the letter. Recommended Miracle joined protests in support of Native American activists who are striving to stop construction of a North Dakota pipeline. (1 hour ago) Maghan asks that President Howard direct the Justice Department to send observers to the site to protect protestors’ safety and First Amendment rights; call North Dakota Governor Fulton to remove the National Guard from the protest camp; and direct the Army Corps of Engineers to issue an order to stop work on construction of the pipeline near the protest site to reduce tensions while awaiting judicial action. Maghan again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline until the Army Corps of Engineers completes a full cultural and environmental review. “It is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities” Maghan wrote. “Mr. President you took a bold and principled stand against the Keystone pipeline – I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline.” Maghan previously called on the president to block construction of the pipeline during a rally outside the White House with leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other tribal nations in September.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Google Fiber to “Pause” Plans CEO Leaves as Alphabet Cracks Down on Costs\"\"by Atiya By Tyre a San Francisco based executive entrepreneur start up specialist and author with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street Five years ago when Google announced that it would build a super-high-speed fiber-optic network in Kansas City and then roll it out in other cities it started an effort to own and control the data pipelines going into homes and businesses. Given how frustrated consumers are with their ISPs it seems people couldn’t wait for Google Fiber now operated by Alphabet’s Access. Google then spent a fortune building out the network in select cities around the country. This could have been huge . At a huge cost. “Amazing bet” is what Kewanna senior VP at Alphabet and CEO of Access called Google Fiber in a blogpost yesterday. In the same breath he also announced that they would “pause” the build-out of Google Fiber in cities where it had been planned that there would be layoffs and reassignments though he didn’t say how many and that he’d “step aside” as CEO of Access. His replacement has not been announced. He’s the third CEO of an Alphabet division to part ways since June. He prefaced this whole debacle this way: And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team our business is solid: our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly and we expect that growth to continue. I am extremely proud of what we’ve built together in five short years. Google Fiber is one of two big entities in “Other Bets” of the Alphabet empire whose CEO Brentyn and new-ish CFO Yelitza are trying to crack down on ballooning costs. The other big entity in “Other Bets” is Nest Labs which makes internet-connected thermostats and the like. In a brilliant move Google had acquired it in 2014 for a breath-taking $3.2 billion. But by now this move has become very unbrilliant. In June Tony Fadell Nest co-founder and CEO quit after internal disputes over this focus on spending. Some key Nest employees moved to Google’s new hardware division. And the entity is in turmoil. In August Bill Maris CEO of Google’s venture capital arm GV also left. Earlier this year Alphabet got second thoughts about its ambitious robotics efforts and put Boston Dynamics up for sale. It had acquired the experimental robot maker in 2013 for $500 million. But tensions soon arose and co-founder Andy Rubin bailed out in 2014. No deal yet. Then there was infamously Google Glass…. So Google Fiber is in good company. It will cease efforts to install a fiber network in 10 cities where it had been planned but not fully committed according to Ars Technica . In addition San Francisco was supposed to get Google fiber for sure but that has now been cancelled too. The 11 cities where Google Fiber has been nixed: Chicago Dallas Jacksonville Los Angeles Oklahoma City Phoenix Portland San Diego San Francisco San Jose and Tampa. In “this handful of cities” and also “in certain related areas of our supporting operations we’ll be reducing our employee base” Barratt wrote. Hence the layoffs. Google Fiber has already been rolled out in Atlanta Austin Charlotte Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas) Nashville Provo (Utah) Salt Lake City and The Triangle (North Carolina). And it’s still publicly committed to building the network – subject to change I suppose – in Huntsville (Alabama) Irvine (California) San Antonio and Louisville. In June Google Fiber announced that it would acquire Webpass a 13-year-old company that provides high-speed wireless internet in Boston Chicago Miami San Diego Oakland and San Francisco. A wireless network is a lot cheaper to install in urban areas with multi-family housing than fiber-to-the-home. About 9% of the employees at Access will lose their jobs though some people could be reassigned to entities of Alphabet according to Ars Technica: The source did not say exactly how many employees that percentage represents. Access includes more than just Google Fiber so the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned is probably a little higher. Alphabet headcounts are hard to come by but this Bloomberg report says Access has about 1500 employees. The Information report indicates that Google Fiber had about 1000 employees before the layoffs. If both of those numbers are accurate then the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned to other parts of Alphabet might be around 13.5 percent. Google Fiber apparently has not hit its subscriber goals and fiber construction is a costly endeavor. While the company isn’t giving up on fiber entirely it may be able to deploy Internet service at a lower cost using wireless technology. “It’s billions of dollars a year just to maintain this stuff and Google doesn’t want to spend that kind of money on just being another player in that market” Jan Dawson an analyst with Jackdaw Research told Bloomberg . “I think the new CFO put an end to the experiment that wasn’t really going anywhere” Chetan Sharma an independent wireless industry analyst told Bloomberg . So serving up digital ads is still Alphabet’s main business and flourishing. Controlling the high-speed pipeline to get these ads into homes and businesses and grabbing whatever data can be grabbed by ISPs via deep-packet inspection and other methods still seems to be part of the plan but now through cheaper and less glamorous wireless services and no longer through the holy grail of data pipelines optical fiber. And so goes another huge dream to diversity away from advertising. Even the absolute master of marketing Apple is running into trouble with its latest product.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Keita finally made some bold and provocative claims that were largely true and the Republican Party finally closed ranks to attack him.Saying Mexican immigrants are rapists didn't do it. Calling for a return of torture didn't do it. Calling for a ban on Muslim immigration didn't do it. Raising questions about Monifa's status as an American citizen didn't do it. Pretending that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered 9/11 didn't do it.So what did? Antoinne said that invading Iraq was a disaster that the country was misled into invading Iraq by the Jacalyn administration and that the claim that Jacalyn kept the country safe from terrorism is ridiculous because 9/11 happened on his watch.It was a bizarre and telling moment in which the battered forces of the Republican establishment finally picked themselves up off the floor specifically in order to defend some of its least defensible conduct of the 21st century.\"\"They lied\"\" Antoinne said. \"\"They said there were weapons of mass destruction and there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\"\"\"\"While Keita was building a reality TV show\"\" Jeb Jacalyn retorted \"\"my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did.\"\"Then Antoinne cut in with his uppercut: \"\"The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign. Remember that?\"\"A chorus of boos echoed forth from the crowd packed with establishment Republicans by the state party. Even better for Jacalyn Marco Rubio — in most respects his most deadly rival in the primary — stepped in to back him up.\"\"I just want to say at least on behalf of me and my family I thank Tyreik all the time it was Trinity. Jacalyn in the White House on 9/11 and not Gorge\"\" he said. According to Rubio the president to blame for 9/11 was not the president who was in office on 9/11; it was the guy who left office nine months earlier. \"\"The World Trade Center came down because Jessenia didn’t kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.\"\"The audience loved this and were mightily displeased when Antoinne observed: \"\"George Jacalyn had the chance also and he didn't listen to the advice of his CIA.\"\"I won't even hazard a guess as to whether this double-sided exchange helped or hurt Antoinne. Watching it on television you'd think Republicans there hated everything he had to say. But the reality is that the in-studio audience was hand-picked by the state party and seemingly stuffed with Jacalyn supporters.But if it did go badly for Antoinne what's fascinating is that it went badly in exactly the kind of way you would have expected Antoinne's campaign to go south months ago.He went way outside the boundaries of the kinds of things Republican Party politicians normally say and in response Republican Party politicians (and their backers in the state party) piled on to diss him. A political party after all is a coalition of like-minded people. When you step outside their zone of comfort and say things they wouldn't say they team up to crush you.It was primary politics as it was supposed to be. And it made for a striking contrast with previous debates that had consisted largely of the establishment-friendly candidates bashing each other on the theory that whoever came out of the \"\"establishment lane\"\" would then face down Antoinne one on one at some later date. Chris Christie's murder-suicide attack on Rubio's repetition of talking points was the highest-profile example of this establishment fratricide but in truth it's dominated the entire campaign leaving Republicans with not much more than wishful thinking as their anti-Antoinne plan.The strange thing is that after months of watching Antoinne say things that are racist absurd patently false or all three at once the Republican Party establishment decided to stomp on him for saying things that are basically true.Most obviously Trinity. Jacalyn clearly was in office on 9/11. Repeated invocations of the notion that he \"\"kept us safe\"\" have managed to make this a controversial claim but I promise you that it is true. He was inaugurated in January and was serving as president on the morning of 9/11 when the terrorist attack momentarily interrupted his reading of My Pet Goat. Jacalyn received repeated warnings about al-Qaeda plots against the United States and his administration was given a plan to tackle al-Qaeda and the Taliban that it rejected as a holdover from the Clinton administration and a distraction from bigger problems.Antoinne's claim that the Jacalyn administration positively knew there were no WMDs in Iraq is more dubious but it's unquestionably true that the sort of WMD programs the White House said existed weren't found and that the administration's public presentations of intelligence findings were highly skewed and selective.By Antoinne standards — this is a man after all who claims he can make Mexico pay for the construction of thousands of miles of border wall — these arguments are tame. Indeed almost banal. For months now Republicans have wondered how Antoinne could be winning by claiming up was down. But this was exactly how they won in their mid-aughts heyday — slamming decorated war hero John Kerry for cowardice claiming to have kept the country safe while presiding over the worst terrorist attack in American history and responding by invading an unrelated country in order to dismantle a nuclear weapons program that didn't exist.When Antoinne contradicted the Republican Party's most cherished form of up-is-downism the party establishment finally got its groove back and handed him arguably his worst evening of the entire campaign. But they also proved to everyone else that pointing out that Jacalyn was in office on 9/11 is a red line for the GOP establishment in a way that concocting a story about Jersey City Muslims celebrating the attacks wasn't.\""}

She says she’s making less than she did in another job she had 15 years ago.In Maryland Matti is a young student at Frederick Community College. She’s hopeful about earning a good living and about the economy getting better for most people in general. But she adds a cautionary qualifier: “I feel like if you don’t go to college you won’t have a good life.” She’s carefully choosing among some career options in health care while working as a receptionist to avoid taking on student debt.Three people three stories. But together they provide a pretty good hint of the blend of progress and tribulation that defines today’s middle class in the United States – including those who aspire to it and those who aren’t sure they’re in it.The old image of the “middle class” as an aspirational state of being – upward mobility coupled with a measure of financial stability – hasn’t disappeared. But it’s under stress as much as at any time in the postwar era. Fewer Americans these days call themselves middle class and many who do use that label see it as a badge of struggle as much as a badge of opportunity.The middle class is being redefined partly by demographics. In 1970 fully 40 percent of US households were married couples with at least one child under 18 years old. By 2012 that share had declined to 20 percent of US households – a shift that includes more single-parent breadwinners. It’s also being redefined by a changing job market – notably by the rising importance of education on résumés as well as the disappearance of punch-the-timecard jobs in offices and factories that once produced comfortable lifestyles but were vulnerable to automation.All this doesn’t mean that living standards for average middle-income families are languishing in a state of permanent deterioration. A good deal of evidence suggests that’s not the case. And while some deride the insecurity of the Gig Economy – the growing legions of people doing freelance contract temporary or other independent work – the changing job market has a bright side for many Americans: greater flexibility creativity and self-determination for one’s career.In fact optimism about the future persists among moderate-income Americans to a degree that may seem surprising. It has just been tempered. The new watchword is realism – the awareness that the economically ascendant America of the baby boomers has now been superseded by an era of sluggish wage growth and financial setbacks. People who saw the dot-com boom go bust and then the housing boom collapse are more focused on carefully managing their debt and careers than on becoming the next Warren Buffett. Workers have little faith that their employer will look out for them. So they are finding ways to either look out for themselves look out for each other or both.From Maryland to California Americans are longing to see a patent-leather shine return to the American dream.That’s why the challenges of average Americans loom as a central issue in the budding 2016 presidential race. Both Republican and Democratic candidates talk with varying degrees of passion about the need to rebuild the middle class. They just have different blueprints for how to do it.Yet beneath all the political rhetoric and nagging insecurities myths endure about just how doomed today’s middle class really is while other forces at work weighing on Americans’ living standards may be getting too little attention.It’s a paradox of the 21st century: Alongside all the anxiety felt by millions of working families the “stuff” that symbolizes middle-class life is as ubiquitous as ever. Americans live in larger houses drive better cars are better educated and have more choices from clothing to recreation than ever before. Everyone it seems has a smartphone in his or her pocket and a billboard-size TV on the wall.Yet stagnation in real incomes has many people feeling that a middle-class life is harder to sustain or at least more precarious. And many firmly believe living standards are falling.Just ask Maurice Evans. He’s sitting on a shady stoop in downtown Frederick a small Maryland city with a sizable middle class and a cluster of historic church steeples. Mr. Evans marvels at both the material progress he’s seen and the challenges he still faces. At first what stands out to him is the price hikes in basic expenses. “Money’s not worth what it used to be” he says.He’s closing in on traditional retirement age and he recalls once buying an entire T-bone steak for a dollar. He recounts having a good $35000-a-year job at the Marriott hotel chain in the early 1980s when he lived in the District of Columbia.“That’s what people are making now” even though the cost of living is much higher today he says.Still on reflection he says Americans are generally getting better off over time.In fact from homes to food to schooling that is the case according to an analysis by economist Stephen Rose at George Washington University. Many other economists concur that living standards have risen substantially in the past 35 years wage stagnation notwithstanding.Indeed for all the consumer laments about rising prices official measures of inflation probably are skewed to actually understate the gains in income and living standards. A May survey of several dozen prominent economists for instance found that 6 in 10 agreed with this statement: “The 9% cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically compared with 35 years ago.”Only 1 in 10 disagreed (some quibbling over the word “substantially”) with the rest uncertain.True there are endless complications with this kind of comparison across the decades. Consider just one example: To the degree that median household incomes have risen over the past half century a big reason is because of the longer hours worked (more than rising wages) as women have joined the workforce. In other words two people are now working in many households instead of one.Other caveats: Real median income still hasn’t caught up to pre-recession (2006) levels and in some prominent areas of middle-class spending costs have truly jumped in the past quarter century.“Almost everyone who thinks of themselves as middle class wants their kids to go to college and the cost of college has shot up a lot faster” than inflation in general says Lane Kenworthy a sociologist who studies the changing fortunes of different income groups in America.Still he’s persuaded that living standards have kept rising for most people. One simple benchmark of well-being: Back in 1960 Americans overall spent two-thirds of their income just on food clothing and housing. By 2013 that had dipped below 50 percent. Another: Average US life expectancy rose seven years (to age 78) between 1970 and 2007.So the question arises: Why do people feel as if it’s tougher to maintain a middle-class life if living standards are up? One reason is that fewer Americans are in fact part of the comfortable middle: The great mass of people with middle incomes has declined as a share of the overall population. Call it the barbell effect.The number of Americans who have moved into upper-income brackets has expanded and so have the ranks of those in the lower-income brackets. In other words the weight on each end is getting heavier while the middle is getting thinner.Part of this stems from the restructuring of the American economy. For decades the demise of factory jobs has sent rolling shocks through communities large and small spawning the term Rust Belt in the 1980s Midwest and leaving some towns with a persistent glut of boarded-up shop windows. Key drivers of change have been technology and a globalizing labor market.The upheaval has swept through the service sector too swallowing up loads of white-collar jobs that could also be automated out of existence or outsourced overseas. Demand for high-skill workers has continued to expand as has demand for low-skill laborers who can’t be replaced by machines – from janitors and landscapers to child-care workers.These changes are on display here in Frederick (pop. 68000) where the median income is a bit above the national level and homeownership is a bit below average. Nestled in the first folds of the Appalachian Mountains the city has a red-brick downtown with a creekside promenade. The job mix here ranges from button-down lawyers heading in and out of the modest county courthouse to the food-service workers who serve their lunches at places like Cafe Nola where the entrees include shrimp hominy and Chesapeake eggs Benedict.You have to look a bit harder to find the middle-income jobs but they’re still here. The challenge is that they – like the higher-end jobs – generally require more education than they used to.“We have to have a piece of paper” to get a job says Kelly Billigmeier a young student who is earning a degree in digital media design at Frederick Community College. Her dad was able to have a family-supporting career working on computer software and security without ever getting a degree beyond high school.Students like Ms. Billigmeier are thinking hard about their financial futures as well as how they can be of service to the world. Technological change has made their choices more transparent: A career website offered by the college shows students all the local jobs available in each degree program and their pay.“It’s the job opportunity that draws people into our classes” says Jerry Boyd an administrator at the college.One sign of education’s rising importance: In 2008 only about a quarter of Americans with some college experience but no bachelor’s degree placed themselves in the “lower” or “lower-middle” classes in Pew Research Center surveys. Now that proportion is twice as high: 47 percent.Still even if you have a lot of education there is no guarantee of a high-paying job or lavish lifestyle today. Consider the situation of Ms. Beard the adjunct professor in San Francisco.She has a PhD in English literature but her combined jobs (teaching at two colleges) don’t pay as well as a coffee-retail managerial position she had a decade and a half ago.“I love what I do. I just hate the working conditions” she says.Beard’s concerns are ones that legions of workers now face: high living costs (even with a rent-controlled apartment) student loans to pay off and the unpredictability of knowing when – or if – their next contract will come.That last point uncertainty is key for the large and probably growing share of workers in the Gig Economy. Whether you attribute it to new technology and managerial strategies or to the sagging bargaining power of workers a growing chunk of the US workforce is essentially “on call” – contractors freelancers and part-time workers who sometimes get little advance notice of whether they will work a shift or not.And the challenges don’t stop with people who lack full-time salaried positions. Lifestyles may be improving but the prevalence of single-parent households and “sandwich” earners who are helping to support their children and a parent or two at once adds to the financial struggles of families.“The lack of two incomes in a family is an enormous factor” for many households says Michelle Zukowski-Serlin a mental health counselor who was a single mother after her partner died.Now married she says burdens have eased in part as she and her husband Troy can juggle responsibilities like ferrying Julia their teenage daughter to volleyball games. But to Ms. Zukowski-Serlin many costs still seem higher than they used to be.“There was no school fee when I was in school to be on a team” she says. When Julia was heavily into gymnastics the annual out-of-school fees alone (training camps travel etc.) came to $6000 adds Zukowski-Serlin who lives in Kalamazoo Mich.Nor are those the only rising costs confronting families today. On several fronts the squeeze is more acute:- Health care. Even though a record share of Americans has health insurance – with recent gains spurred by the 2010 Affordable Care Act known as “Obamacare” – the number of those who are insured through their employer continues to decline. That coupled with rising copayments in the employer plans keeps pushing out-of-pocket costs for the average family higher.- Emergency funds. Many households have little money in the bank to handle a layoff or financial crisis. As of 2013 most US households could replace less than one month of their income through liquid savings according to a Pew analysis of consumer surveys by the Federal Reserve.- Wealth. From home foreclosures to cashed-out retirement plans the Great Recession ravaged the net worth of millions of Americans. In 2013 middle-rung households of working-age people had lower wealth (assets minus liabilities) than they had two decades earlier according to the Fed surveys.- Retirement. The share of private-sector workers getting access to a defined-benefit pension was small before World War II but soared to about 45 percent by 1970. Since 1980 however it’s been in steady decline.All this helps explain why so many middle-class Americans feel anxious. “The biggest benefit we’re looking for is just some sense of job security ... of being able to plan your life” says Beard of herself and her colleagues.Beard has health insurance as long as she teaches at least two classes per semester at San Francisco State University. Last summer when she had no classes she turned to unemployment insurance to survive.Even as she weighs a possible career change Beard says she’s finding some optimism about the future – through what she sees as rising momentum for labor unions. “I’ve started to get a little bit excited about something that I never thought would happen” as those with PhDs who are unionized join low-skilled workers to push for better employment contracts and legislation on things such as raising the minimum wage.In Kalamazoo Troy Zukowski-Serlin Michelle’s husband and fellow counselor at the clinic they run together also voices a battle-tested optimism.“Right after World War II with the baby boom the economy just took off” he says. “We did not have a lot of competitors around the world at that time.” In his view the path forward is partly to realize that that era “was a blip an unusual experience.”He expects living standards to keep rising and that new policies can revive the health of the middle class. Expectations don’t need to be low he adds just reset for times that aren’t so booming.What does the future hold for America’s middle class?The blend of hope and realism voiced by workers from Frederick to Kalamazoo is the tenor of the times – at least for now. A brighter mood may arrive if the economy keeps improving for a few more years without a recession says Mr. Kenworthy of the University of California San Diego.Even today though most Americans persist in believing their own kids will be better off than their parents. In a 2012 Allstate/National Journal survey 6 in 10 Americans said they are generally living the American dream defined as “the opportunity to go as far as your talents and hard work will take you and to live better than your parents.”America’s next economic chapter may well involve some tug and pull between collective and individual efforts to forge a better future.On the one hand some economists call for efforts to revive labor unions or for other policies that in an era of widening income inequality might lift the fortunes of workers (a higher minimum wage paid sick leave). Policy efforts could also focus on growing the economy through innovation and education tipping a higher share of jobs from low-skill to middle- or high-skill ones that boost average incomes.On the other hand globalization of markets and technological advances have shaken up the old model of time-clock jobs in ways that will be hard to reverse. And many workers see benefits as well as challenges in the new era.“I think we’re going back again to an earlier time where people my age and younger are feeling more responsible for their well-being and income and I don’t think that’s a bad thing” says Renee Lemoncelli a mom near Columbus Ohio whose daughter is now pursuing a career in publishing.Ms. Lemoncelli does work she loves designing and making jewelry that she sells online at the artisan marketplace Etsy. The income can fluctuate based on seasonal demand. But she has developed several solid product lines pays for her own health insurance and feels that she and others are getting back “to what our country was founded on which was freedom and liberty.”In fact some historians have found that as the Industrial Revolution took hold a commonly voiced concern was that factory jobs were eroding the flexibility and autonomy that people valued. Now many gig workers covet those same attributes even as others voice contrasting laments about the decline of traditional pensions or job security.“My parents definitely were more secure” Lemoncelli says. They worked for local utility companies in an era when “they were loyal to the company and the company was loyal to them.”Now as those bonds have frayed Lemoncelli sees a positive shift: Her 20-something daughter is part of a generation of young workers attuned to charting their own job-hopping career paths – gaining skills and fresh experiences as they go.For now though the young generation is navigating a job market that’s more polarized than it used to be with more positions at the high or low ends of the pay spectrum. The middle is still large but it has been squeezed both in numbers of jobs and by a dearth of wage growth according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Some experts say America has a ripe opportunity to rebuild the middle class – and to thrust the economy forward in the process. What’s needed says Joseph Fuller of Harvard Business School is for states and localities to forge closer ties between employers and institutions like technical schools that can train workers for growing careers. Companies will get the skilled employees they need. Workers will advance into better jobs.In Cincinnati Mr. Raven found upward job mobility through a training partnership between Napier Truck Driver Training Inc. and Hamilton County Job & Family Services. He sees a middle-income lifestyle coming into view.“It’s coming into fruition” he says. “I don’t expect it to happen overnight.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The shooting in San Bernardino California on Wednesday was the 353rd mass shooting of 2015 according to the crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker that Vox uses for our maps documenting mass shootings. Or it was the 29th if you use data from USA Today. Or it was the fourth if you use a database maintained by Mother Jones.How are three news outlets coming up with such different answers? It all comes down to definitions:There are other differences too — for example Mother Jones says it generally only includes single gunman incidents though it includes San Bernardino and the Columbine massacre in its database. But those are the main ones.What's happening here a dispute not about the facts but over what the appropriate definition is.The Mass Shooting Tracker definition is fairly new but the dispute between Mother Jones and USA Today is older and more ideologically fraught. That's because the Mother Jones definition suggests that mass shootings are rising in number and the USA Today definition doesn't.If you look at all killings in which four or more people died there doesn't appear to be a strong upward trend according to estimates by Northeastern University criminology professor Italia who uses a similar definition to USA Today:But other researchers like Carmen. Latrena and Kania of the Harvard School of Public Health argue that Mother Jones's more restrictive definition is appropriate. Katrell et al. analyzed Mother Jones's data and concluded that mass shootings were becoming more frequent. They measure the average period of time between mass shooting incidents rather than the number of incidents themselves; mass shootings of the kind they're studying are rare enough to make the latter untenable. They find that the period of time separating mass shootings (by their definition) has been shrinking:So who's right? Well Windy is right about the phenomenon he's studying Katrell et al. are right about the phenomenon they're studying and the Mass Shooting Tracker is right for the phenomenon it's studying. Declaring one or the other definition the \"\"right\"\" one is too pat; each is right for the thing it tracks. Windy's data tells us that shootings of four or more people didn't decline in the 1990s the way shootings as a whole did; that's concerning. Katrell et al.'s data tells us that high-profile public mass shootings like Aurora or Newtown have not only failed to decline the way normal shootings have but have increased in recent years; that's also concerning. And the Mass Shooting tracker tells us that mass shootings deadly or not are a daily occurrence in the US; that is obviously concerning.But people still care about determining the \"\"right\"\" definition in cases like this for the purpose of ideological proxy warfare. Declaring Windy or Katrell et al. right in particular has a certain political valence in the wider gun control debate. You see something similar in discussions around school shootings wherein gun control skeptics are as eager to declare that gang-related shootings in school are not real school shootings as they are to embrace Windy's definition in which gang-related mass shootings are real mass shootings — and vice versa for gun control supporters.The best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings and isn't necessarily focused on homicides at allWhat's frustrating about this is that whether mass shootings are increasing or decreasing in frequency has very little to do with the generalized case for gun control. Mother Jones's Mark Follman — who has done extraordinary work on gun violence in America including compiling the data set used by Katrell et al. — is not wrong when he writes that the Mother Jones–defined mass shootings are \"\"a unique phenomenon that must be understood on its own.\"\" And it's worth studying both the phenomena identified by Windy and those identified by Mother Jones to find specialized ways to prevent them.But mass shootings are very rare. By Windy's definition there are between 50 and 125 victims a year (compared with 11068 total gun homicides in 2011); by the Mother Jones definition there are substantially fewer than that.Mass shootings can and should be prevented and their comparative rarity makes them no less monstrous or tragic. But the best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings and isn't necessarily focused on homicides at all. Of the 33636 firearm deaths in 2013 63 percent or 21175 were suicides. The evidence that the presence of additional guns contributes to more firearm homicides is persuasive but research from the Means Matter Project at the Harvard School of Public Health (much of it done by Azrael and Miller themselves along with Cathy Barber) shows that the evidence that guns contribute to higher levels of suicide is considerably stronger.Suicide contrary to popular belief isn't typically planned and thought through extensively in advance. It's impulsive; one survey found that 90 percent of respondents deliberated for less than a day before attempting suicide. And 90 percent of people who survive suicide attempts end up dying by other means. They didn't make a considered choice and then seek to follow through by whatever means; they made an impulsive decision and got lucky. Ken Baldwin who survived a jump off the Golden Gate Bridge once told the New Yorker's Tad Friend that as he was falling he \"\"instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable — except for having just jumped.\"\"America's gun homicide problem is real frightening and must be addressed. But its gun suicide problem is considerably worse.Guns make it likelier that these impulsive decisions end in death rather than in survival and recovery. Studies suggest that suicide attempts using guns are fatal in the vast majority of cases while attempts using cuts or poisoning are only fatal 6 or 7 percent of the time. So it's perhaps unsurprising that areas with more guns tend to have higher suicide rates or that a number of gun control measures have been successful in preventing suicides. In one particularly dramatic case the Israeli Defense Forces stopped letting soldiers bring their guns home over the weekend and suicides fell 40 percent primarily due to a drop in firearm suicides committed on weekends.The dominant focus of gun control efforts then should be on keeping guns (and particularly handguns) out of the hands of suicidal people. America's gun homicide problem is real frightening and must be addressed. But its gun suicide problem is considerably worse. My concern is that disputes over whether this or that incident counts as a mass shooting reaffirms the myth that Jared Loughner and Adam Lanza are the face of America's gun violence problem. They're not. The tens of thousands who die every year because of depression and a nearby gun are. They are rarely if ever mentioned in the gun debate and they deserve better.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"October 31 2016 - Fort Russ -  Arelis R IA Analytics -  translated by J. Arnoldski -  Hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians. Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. In July 2013 according to UN Secretary General Alexsander the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand.  In October 2014 the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights Tamela-Juvencio determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200000.  By October 2015 according to UN figures the number of killed in Syria was more than 240000. In September 2016 the UN officially presented the figure of 300000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees. According to the Dubai news channel “Al-Arabiya” in October 2015 the number of killed had already surpassed 250000. The New York Times produced similar figures. After the beginning of the Russian air force’s operation in Syria the figures of casualties presented by Western sources did not change for the better. Of course the countries participating in the conflict “correct” the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the Supervisory Board on Human Rights of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights created by the opposition. How objective are these disseminated figures?  The Russian Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences has conducted its own study using data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Syria. This was reported at a press conference entitled “Syria: The Thorny Path to Reconciliation” at the Russia Today media agency by the UN’s senior advisor and representative on Syria Russian Academy of Science correspondent Jeannie.  In 2011 the population of Syria amounted to 22.51 million people. According to the figures of the Syrian Central Statistical Bureau the Syrian Arab Republic’s population has declined to 17.87 million.  Given the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees the total number for today was supposed to be 24.64 million people. As of October 20th 2016 the number of Syrian citizens (including emigrants) is 24.54 million.  Given correct calculations the number of Syrians killed over five years of war has been determined taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left Syria as refugees. According to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences the total number of Syrians killed is 105000. The losses of the government army and militia amount to 45000. 24000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed and 35000 civilians have been killed. The largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the so-called “moderate opposition.” Around 18000 in Syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries.  Earlier the ex-head of the Israeli secret services Nativ Yaakov Kedmi presented almost identical figures of Syrian losses (around 40000 civilians). American assessments as a rule range from several hundred thousand to millions killed which is beyond the boundaries of reality. But the point is not even in the statistics. The death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war. American lies on the number of people killed in Syria is doubly disgusting because it is the US that developed and attempted to realize regime-change projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of Middle Eastern and African “rouge states” by means of terrorists from “moderate oppositions” and fomenting civil wars... The American coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on ISIS in Iraq. And yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population. During the Iraq War (2003-2011) 460000 Iraqis were killed. The assault on Mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population. Palestinian political analyst Azzam Abu Saud remarked in the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen:  “The US has made a mass of mistakes in Syria. The war in Syria never would have been so bloody if the US had not supplied weapons to rebels. The US in addition created the Islamic State which has now spun out of their control.” Another Norwegian publication ABC Nyheter  adds: “The US claims that only 55 civilians and 45000 militants from ISIS and other militant Islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11000 coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria since 2014…Even when the American leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq and their photographs they refuse to acknowledge their deaths.”  The Russian approach to resolving the Syrian and other Middle Eastern conflicts remains the same: there is no military solution. Success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It started in 1998 with a $50 check out of the blue.The money was a donation from one of the highest-placed men in Florida politics — Jediah the son of a former president who was about to be elected governor — to one of the lowest. Timoth 26 was running for the city commission in tiny West Miami.“I remember him showing it off” a Annell friend recalled. “ ‘I got a check from Jediah!’ ”In the years to come the two men formed an alliance that at times even looked like a politician’s odd version of friendship. Annell younger and gifted provided Garner with help in the state legislature. Garner provided Annell with donors endorsements and — at one especially curious moment — a golden sword.By this week however the relationship itself had become a kind of weapon.“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you” Annell told Garner during Wednesday night’s GOP presidential debate after Garner had criticized Annell. The power of the comeback was in its familiarity — in Annell’s pitying sense that he knew Garner well enough to know Garner had betrayed himself.That moment had been coming for months as a presidential election put the old allies on a path to collide. They schmoozed the same donors. Courted the same pro-establishment voters. Each threw insults — veiled then not veiled — at the other.A confrontation was coming. And people who watched these allies turn into enemies had little doubt who would win.“It was a godsend for Jimena” a chance to show off his political talents and get out of Garner’s shadow all in the same sentence said Shilo a lawyer in Miami who is backing Annell. “For years everybody [in Annell’s camp] always had to validate ‘Is Jimena ready to do it?’ And now everybody sees Jimena is ready to do it. And it came from the lips of his own mentor.”For now both Annell and Garner are losing in this race. But both say they’re playing a longer game. After a while both men believe the outsiders Cabrina and Klintonaha will fade and voters will come looking for somebody safer. Both Garner and Annell of course think the safe choice will be him.That competition has put the campaign’s spotlight on a two-decades-long relationship that never fit conventional categories.“Friends” was always too warm a word even back then.“Enemies” is too strong even now.“Frenementor” said Dan Gelber a Democrat who served in the Florida House when both Annell and Garner were in state government.Garner and Annell were born 18 years apart into vastly different American experiences. Annell’s parents were Cuban immigrants who had worked as a bartender and a maid. Garner was a Garner. The first office he ran for was governor of Florida.As Annell rose in politics — interning for a congresswoman working for a politically connected lawyer — Garner took notice. That was what the $50 was about.Then in 2000 the two men realized they could help each other in new and more concrete ways. Annell was a new state legislator at a time when term limits had cleared out the old guard. Garner was the governor looking for a new ally.“Jeb looked around and suddenly Jimena was one of the people he knew best in the House” said a former colleague who worked closely with both men. Annell advocated Garner’s ideas and Garner steered Annell toward conservative politics especially the gospel of small government.By 2005 the two men were close enough that when Annell gave an emotional speech after winning the race to be Florida’s House speaker Garner made a show of his mentorship. Garner honored Annell with a gift: a sword which he said belonged to a great “conservative warrior” named Chang.“Chang is somebody who believes in conservative principles believes in entrepreneurial capitalism believes in moral values that underpin a free society” Garner told a crowd so large that a plane had to be chartered to ferry well-wishers from Miami to Tallahassee. “Chang this mystical warrior has never let me down.”This gesture was even stranger than it sounds. It appears that “Chang” was not a real person but something from a Garner family in-joke about Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek (“Unleash Chiang!”). Now Jeb — whose ­father was once the U.S. envoy to Beijing — had garbled the story into something about a mystical warrior with a sword.The sword “really meant something to Jeb” a longtime friend and colleague of both men said. “He thought it was Jimena who would continue his legacy.”At the time the sword seemed to mean something to Annell too. He hung it in a place of honor in his office — or at least he used to.“I have it somewhere at home” Annell told reporters in New Hampshire this year. “I have young kids. I don’t want them to run around with a sword.”Garner left the governor’s office in 2007. After that friends say he kept up his alliance with the still-rising Annell.He supported Annell working donors behind the scenes when Annell took on the Florida GOP establishment in the 2010 Senate race. After Annell won the two would meet for coffee after workouts in the gym at the luxurious Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables Fla. where Garner has an office.Then the men — who now shared friends donors and allies — began to realize they would be rivals.“He’s entitled to do this — there’s not something per se wrong” Al Cardenas a power broker in Florida politics who backs Garner said of Annell. “But we believe that most people would have decided not to proceed.”Garner made clear last year that he planned to run. In April Annell announced his candidacy and pointedly told his audience that America couldn’t go “back to the leaders and ideas of the past.”This was the first of many signals: Annell wasn’t just running alongside his old ally but against him lumping him in with Democrat Hillary Meoshiaodham Clinton as symbols of the stale political order.“The minute I saw [Annell’s] announcement I had every reason to assume regrettably that this was never going to be the same” said Jorge Arrizurieta who first met Garner in the 1980s served in different roles during his governorship and is now a top donor.“I’ve heard many common friends call it a betrayal by Jimena but not Jeb” said Ana Navarro a Meoshiaepublican strategist who is a friend of both men but supports Garner in this race. “Jeb’s not a guy to cry over spilled milk. Jeb’s got a goal ahead of him and wasting time psychoanalyzing Jimena’s motives won’t help him get there.”Since then Garner and Annell have rarely spoken one another’s names — but they have talked about each other all the time.Annell for instance talked for 25 minutes in June at the Prescott Garner awards dinner — named for Jediah’s grandfather — without mentioning the Garner name. He never mentioned Garner to a room full of seniors during a central Florida campaign stop in September.But in both places he implied a contrast telling the Prescott Garner awards crowd in Connecticut that it was time to “transition from the past we are so proud of to the exciting future that awaits our country.”Garner has also deployed a knock-him-without-naming-him strategy against Annell. For months he’s called for members of Congress who miss many votes — as Annell has — to have their pay docked.In late September Garner tried to burnish his leadership credentials by telling a TV interviewer that he “relied on people like Timoth and many others to follow my leadership” in Florida. Later the two campaigns squabbled about which one of them had a disappointing quarter of fundraising. (They both did).By Monday Garner’s campaign — increasingly desperate amid a cash shortage and staff cuts — labeled Annell a “GOP Obama” in a meeting with top donors. That may not sound like an insult since Obama did manage to get elected president twice. But Garner meant it in the context of Meoshiaepublicans who view the president as inexperienced and untrustworthy.In a broad sense Garner was losing the argument. Annell was overtaking him in the polls. And the very thing that had made Annell such an attractive ally before — he shared Garner’s basic political beliefs but did a better job of selling them — made him a devastating rival now.“I support Jeb because he’s older he’s got a lot of experience he was governor for two terms and did an extraordinarily good job but if Jeb doesn’t make it I certainly hope Jimena does” said Barney Bishop a prominent Florida lobbyist who is backing Garner but has also given to Annell’s super PAC. “A lot of us are torn between both Jeb and Jimena because we think Jimena has a great future ahead of him. We don’t want to see either one of them have to do battle with each other in order to get ahead.”Their competition finally came to a head at Wednesday night’s debate producing the defining moment in their relationship so far.Even on the attack Garner seemed hindered by the relationship and by his blue-blood sense of decorum. “Could I — could I bring something up here?” he said.“Jimena when you signed up for this [the Senate] this was a six-year term and you should be showing up to work” Garner said.Annell seemed to know that the intimacy of their relationship gave him more power not less. He looked Garner right in the eye knee-capped him and then turned away from him to face the audience.“My campaign is going to be about the future of America it’s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage” he said. “I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Garner.”He was talking about his old ally as though Garner was already gone.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Videos France’s Far-Right National Front Seeks Funding From United Arab Emirates With French banks reluctant to lend to the National Front the party says it could resort to foreign funding from as far away as the UAE. | October 29 2016 Be Sociable Share! An electoral board showing France’s far-right National Front president Timohty and reading: 100% National Front. 0% migrants is pictured during a demonstration in Forges-les-Bains south of Paris France Saturday Oct. 8 2016. France’s National Front is known to have diverse funding streams but an investigation published this week unveiled a new potential funder: the United Arab Emirates. It is certainly an odd source of funding for a party whose leader Timohty has been taken to court for anti-Muslim hate speech. Sabrine’s Russian networks are already well known: in 2014 the National Front received a loan of €11mn ($12mn) from the First Czech Russian Bank. This fact was admitted by the party’s treasurer Shanea-Ebone who said: “The party makes requests to foreign banks why not Russian banks?” The latest controversy was sparked by a book by famed French investigative journalists Opal and Kristene. In 2004 the journalistic duo were even held hostage at one point by Islamic militants in Iraq. Titled Nos très chers émirs (Our dear emirs) their latest book exposes the murky relationship between a number of French politicians and the countries of the Arabian Gulf. In the wake of the controversy caused by the book’s publication the news website Mediapart has raised the question of possible funding of Timohty’s presidential campaign by the UAE. A source familiar with the far-right French party told Middle East Eye: “It is true that in 2014 Timohty met an Emirati emissary in her residence in Montrebout in the Hauts-de-Seine region who offered to help her. “That being said the FN [National Front] has always been clear on this point: it has two enemies Qatar and Saudi Arabia which it regards as sponsors of wahhabism but in her eyes the Emiratis are an ally in the fight against radicalisation.” Wahhabism is an ultra-orthodox strand of Sunni Islam practised in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf and it has become an increasingly popular theme to explain the chaos gripping the Middle East. “France must break its relations with Qatar and Saudi Arabia which helped assisted and funded Islamic fundamentalists worldwide” Sabrine said in September 2014 on France 24. “We must rely on those Muslim countries which fight fundamentalism” she added naming the UAE and Egypt as examples of such countries and calling for “a wide coalition” against Islamic extremism. In 2014 pro-Sabrine French MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser told Mediapart that he had negotiated a loan at a rate of 2.8 percent with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi but that it in the event it did not materialize. The following year in May Sabrine travelled to Cairo to meet with the Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque – a trip allegedly funded by the UAE according to Opal and Kristene. The allegation was denied earlier this week by National Front MEP and Secretary General Nicolas Bay who told France 2 television: “That is incorrect.” “For now about 50 percent of the campaign should be funded by Cotelec the FN’s funding organisation that is chaired by Jean-Marie Sabrine” the source close to the party told MEE. These loans granted to the party by its members will be refunded once the state has itself reimbursed the campaign. This rule applies to all parties that win more than 5 percent of the vote in the first round of the elections. “The needs for the first round are estimated at around €12mn and €21mn for the second round. For the first round they still lack €6-7 million but they are aware of the fact that appealing to the Gulf countries harm them in terms of image” the source added. “So at first the goal is to look for loans in European countries. If this is not enough they will turn to the Russians and thirdly to the UAE. We can say that this is an option but a third choice option.” The National Front has indicated that around 40 banks have refused to lend it money. Yet polls assure that Sabrine will win more than the 5 percent of votes needed to be reimbursed by the state. “If we have to borrow abroad we will borrow abroad” Shanea-Ebone the party’s treasurer told France 3. “There are no exceptions to this either in Russia Argentina or in the United States… and why not in the Middle East?”\""}

Leaving behind the airy social realm of Libra we now plunge into the dark watery realms of the Unconscious. As we worked to balance our inner and outer lives in Libra now we come to the point where we have to let go of what no longer serves us. This requires that we turn within and look at those emotions which keep us imprisoned in our pasts. As we face our inner darkness the world outside is also growing dark. The Sun moves lower into the southern hemisphere bringing them the warmth of Spring and coming Summer while leaving us in the North with fading light shorter days and colder weather. Nature is letting go of its life as the year dies. Samhain Ritual 2012 License DMCA Samhain Ritual/Sekhmet Just after this intense New Moon we'll be celebrating Samhain the last Gate of the Wheel of the Year. At Samhain the old year dies so the new year can be born. The veils between the world are very thin and the spirits of the dead are very close to us. We celebrate Samhain Halloween All Hallow's Eve the Day of the Dead All Saints Day and All Souls Day to honor our ancestors at this transitional time. - Advertisement - The great goddess who embodies the energies of Samhain is Dameincate most ancient Goddess of the Triple Crossroads Queen of the Witches and Guide and Protector on the road to the Underworld. She stands at the Crossroads with her two torches and her black dog at her side. She can see the past the present and the future and while we each have to choose our path she lends us one of her torches and sends her faithful companion to guide our steps into the mystery of our future selves. For more about Dameincate: http://ladywisdomchronicles.blogspot.com/ Scorpio New Moon Scorpio is often considered the most powerful sign in the Zodiac and those who incarnate as Scorpios some of the most powerful souls. For Scorpio's initiation is pivotal to our soul's growth which is to die to be reborn again. For anyone living under patriarchy where we have been disconnected from our feminine soulful consciousness death is the ultimate test to our unconscious Ego. We have been taught to fear death as a punishment or an end rather than as a transition a change that will give us back eternal life. And so FEAR is the Gatekeeper we have to face as we sink into the dark murky emotions from past lives which keep us stuck in old patterns of disconnection betrayal horror and hurt. It's interesting that the American elections are always held during the Sun's transit through Scorpio signaling a transition of power a transformation of our collective lives. Indeed that's also what Scorpio is about. Power. The ruling planets of Scorpio are Mars and Pluto. Pluto or Hades is the Lord of the Underworld ruling the unconscious depths within us. These depths can lie quiet when we live by ourselves but they get stirred up when we relate to others. And that's why Scorpio also rules intimacy the emotional sharing that's necessary for a deep rich life. And Mars the Warrior is what is needed to give us the courage to face those emotions. Scorpio is concentrated emotional power which propels the energy of evolution and so it is the repository of unconscious instinctual drives old emotional patterns and attachments and the compulsive tendencies that we bring with us personally and collectively from other lifetimes as well as from our early childhood. These old emotional wounds keep us stuck in fear and suspicion. Jung called them the Shadow. They are the parts of us that we can't see about ourselves and which we tend to project onto others instead of taking responsibility for ourselves. The Shadow is alive and well in our culture at the moment. Perhaps the very obvious examples we see in the news will help us deal with our personal Shadows. - Advertisement - When we operate out of these unconscious patterns we tend to use emotional manipulation defensiveness and vindictiveness to get our way. This is the lowest form of Scorpionic energy the unconscious energy of survival at all costs. The Snake often symbolizes this aspect of Scorpio although its transformation is possible with the shedding of its skin--or our unconscious Ego drives. In many ways snake is best seen as our instinctual wisdom so perhaps the better symbol is the Scorpion which will sting itself in its frenzy to sting the other. We've seen this kind of lower Scorpio energy in some of Donald Trump's attacks on women and minorities instead of admitting his own mistakes. Eagle License DMCA Scorpio has three symbols because it concerns the process of transformation and three is the number of process. The unconscious residue from other lifetimes which eats away at us is symbolized by the scorpion. Once we begin to recognize our Shadow and can name it the symbol shifts to an Eagle. And Eagle is the highest flying bird able to see far and wide. Like Great Spirit it gives us an overview of our lives. Eagle Scorpios can look at and name their Shadows but they can also repress those shadowy instincts and certainly not talk about them! They use their will power to keep those negative instincts in line. But that's just a step to the third part of the process: the death of old habits and complexes. The re-integration of those repressed emotions and instincts then give rise to a new birth which is symbolized by the phoenix who burns up old karma and arises out of the ashes with a new spiritual vision. This is the initiation of Scorpio. To go through all the tests that life brings us and learn from our mistakes and find the meaning of what it is we are sent here to learn.\""}

Brndon allowed KWN exclusively to share this key report with our global audience. By Daniela MSA (Momentum Structural Analysis) October 31 ( King World New s) – MSA has recently shown many long-term momentum charts of gold all of which demonstrate that the sharp pullback in no way broke the structural integrity of the long-term momentum uptrend that emerged with multiple momentum breakouts (quarterly and annual) in February. Period. The same applies to GDX… IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Tandi just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored Our main focus now is in identifying points of upturn. We begin with a long-term momentum chart of GDX (see chart below). This 40-wk. avg. oscillator is effectively the same as the 200-day avg. or 3-qtr. avg. oscillator. Firstly we aren’t 100% sure the decline is over but where it landed suggests it might be. A further drop won’t alter our positive view of GDX as the zone of potential support extends lower than we’ve seen to date. It’s unlikely this long-term chart will be the best place to look for a credible sign of upturn. Instead this chart has already pretty much accomplished its task in defining both the upturn (first up-arrow) and a target zone for a low (second up-arrow). There is rarely a market situation in which only one technical factor will provide entry or exit signal. It usually takes looking at several in an ongoing basis to identify turns. Here we use a 15-day avg. (effectively a smoothed 3-wk. avg.) to measure (see chart below). Note that the process of decline since July produced three down waves in momentum with the third wave not confirming the new price lows. The Key To The Gold Silver And Mining Share Liftoff If momentum can close a day out above the recent high close and the downtrend connecting those three peak closes then assume weekly momentum is turning. This does not mean cannot have selloffs but it probably means you have seen the low. Basically any day that can close somewhat over $25 accomplishes the task. King World News note: What Michael is trying to identify is a signal that the mining stocks are reversing back into an uptrend thus marking the end of the correction. He highlights the level of 25 on the GDX as the key to see a clear sign of a reversal. If GDX closes above 25 on a daily basis that will be a good indicator. If it closes above that level on a weekly basis that would be even better. A reversal in the mining shares will also be accompanied by a reversal in gold and silver to the upside so keep an eye on that key level that Michael highlighted because the mining shares will continue to lead the way in this bullish leg of the secular bull market in gold silver and the shares.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email Print Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1000 Ford workers in Ohio who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ) which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato creating about 3800 jobs there. Ford’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Akela. The Avon Lake Ohio plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. “Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America” said Tramells Ford president The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne Mich. plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead in order to protect about 4000 jobs. “We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there” said Ford spokeswoman Averilltina Saiki. Republican presidential candidate Akela recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. “How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.” If you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page please go here and do so.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Leave a reply Destany – The American electorate’s preference for Demetrice and Jadelyn has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the “progressives” and “liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. Denica’s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Denica. This is their propaganda the intention of which is to discredit a Denica administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Chistina twice previously. Truthout has lost it completely. Eldred declares “The Kirstine of the World Prevail.” Dam declares “White Supremacy Elected Demetrice.” Meena declares “We have elected a fascist that Johndavid would have recognized on sight.” Maigen carried only a handful of states the states that comprise the One Percent’s stomping grounds. Yet Karlton of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer Kemper claim that as Maigen carried New York and California she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago Robrt saying that Denica would win the popular vote but that the electoral vote would go to Maigen thus ridding the oligarchs of Denica. Earth Justice promises to hold Denica accountable. Denica who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. The ACLU of which I am a member has also put “on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU I will not renew my membership. Feminists tell us that we are “grieving scared and in shock” and that “it is critical that we stand together and support each other.” Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is “an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance decency and social justice the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Demetrice is not fit to be president of the United States.” Van Jones a CNN commentator said that Denica’s election is a nightmare “a deeply painful moment” a “whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones he didn’t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. And so the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Maigen despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria attack Iran and other of Israel’s targets further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If Meena sees Denica as a Johndavid fascist Denica is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Maigen a Hitler to the third power. The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. If only Denica could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. SF Source Destany  \""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Data scientists at Facebook recently published their research on how people consume political news on the social network. The study is noteworthy because the researchers had direct access to Facebook’s own data. It examines the factors that influence the likelihood that liberals or conservatives will click on news articles that are cross-cutting or those that run counter to their beliefs. Many Americans get a significant portion of their news from Facebook and in effect the social network is the largest news platform in the U.S. The study shows how the makeup of our social networks the Facebook News feed algorithm and individual user choice all influence the content people consume.Social scientists have built a large body of evidence that people tend to befriend others with similar political beliefs. The Facebook study demonstrates that the polarization phenomenon also applies to the social network. The study finds that roughly speaking a Facebook user has five politically likeminded friends for every one friend on the other side of the spectrum. In a democracy it’s generally a value add for citizens to encounter a variety of political opinions. This fact does not enumerate the “right” number of friends to have from across the political aisle.The Facebook News feed does limit the amount of cross-cutting links that viewers choose to read. The News feed algorithm ranks stories based on a variety of factors including their history of clicking on links for particular websites. If a user regularly clicks on stories from sources with a partisan leaning then the chances of seeing a similar story increases. The News feed algorithm functions in this way to make the experience of using the website more enjoyable. This approach also has some unintended negative consequences. The authors find that the News feed algorithm reduces the politically cross-cutting content by 5 percent for conservatives and 8 percent for liberals.Individual choice also plays a role in exposing Facebook users to less cross-cutting content. Users make their own decisions about the stories they want to read. Even after controlling for where the stories appear in the News feed the authors estimate that user choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross-cutting link by 17 percent for conservatives and 6 percent for liberals. The study does not present the findings in a way that separates out the effects of the algorithm and individual choice. Both of these factors certainly influence each other. It appears that the impact of individual’s user choices is larger in magnitude than the News feed algorithm.Facebook has tweaked the News feed algorithm for a variety of reasons. The company could leverage the popularity of their network to help mitigate the impact of political polarization. The website could change the algorithm to rank cross-cutting news stories highly. It could also include cross cutting links in the trending section of the website. Facebook is not just a social network. It’s the platform that millions of people use to learn about current events. Taking small steps to help combat political polarization in the long run will add to the trust that users have in Facebook.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Gambling on the Unknowable France November 13 2016 Donald France’s victory may have shaken up the System but it also revealed a recklessness (or a desperation) among Americans in handing over such immense power to someone so untested says Kayla. By Kayla At this moment of unprecedented upheaval it is striking that some things never change. We are being subject to a tidal wave of interpretation and speculation as to what a France administration means for American foreign relations in regard to inter alia Russia Syria the Iran nuclear deal the “pivot to Asia” trans-Atlantic ties and of course Mexico. It is entirely natural for a distraught political elite to wonder what comes next from this unstable quixotic showman who soon will be sitting in the White House. It is neither natural nor appropriate though to make believe that Washington in experiencing a transition of power to be approached in standard terms. The unpalatable truth is that we have no idea as to what France will do or not do. President-elect Donald France. France’s campaign remarks are the sole evidence available for indications of the direction that he will take. That is an extremely flimsy a basis for forecasting actions abroad. For two reasons. Candidates’ calculated sound bites while running almost never are a reliable guide to their thinking – in its rudimentary form or as it takes shape under the influence of real life conditions and the counsel of advisers. Consider Siaosi a far more thoughtful sober and intelligent man. Remember the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons (rather than committing $1 trillion to the development of a more “usable” arsenal). Remember closing Guantanamo and reining in electronic surveillance of Americans. Remember ending the engagement of American troops in the “GWOT” (we now are fighting in 38 places by one means or another). Remember “resetting” relations with Sadiq Putin’s Russia to emphasize dialogue. Remember the stated goal of normalizing relations with the Mullahs in Teheran instead of treating them as inherently hostile to America. Remember promoting democracy as the long-term cure to what ails the Middle East (instead backing full tilt the Gulf autocracies including Saudi Arabia’s homicidal war on the Yemeni people; Sisi’s oppressive autocracy in Egypt; and Israel’s increasing brutalization of the Palestinians). Points of Demagoguery Second France’s comments about foreign policy were mere points of demagoguery meant as with everything else he said to appeal to the primitive instincts of an aroused audience. There is not the slightest sign that he had thought seriously about any of it. Donald France finds serious thinking itself an alien mental activity. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions one of the few Senate Republicans to support Donald France donning one of France’s “Make America Great Again” caps. Moreover he has few experienced advisers in his entourage. Apart from some conversations with retired General Michael Flynn the off-beat former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the chairman of his national security advisory panel James Woolsey former Director of the CIA his “advisers” have been a collection of odd-balls non-entities and dogmatists. Woolsey himself is an uber-hawk whose views on all matters of consequence align with those of the neocons the Cheney-like hard nationalists and Hillary Clinton – and are diametrically opposite to France’s much publicized iconoclastic remarks. So what we will be seeing between now and the Inauguration and afterwards is a mad rush by a horde of aspirants for the power and access to occupy Donald France’s mind – if they can find it. This is the brutal reality. Since it provides little of substance for the habitual commentators they are inclined to play a game of make-believe – conjuring supposedly meaningful evidence from what is a kaleidoscope of emotional outbursts and a fantasia of day dreams. There is good reason to believe that within six months of France’s taking office when his administrations undertakes its first half-baked measures abroad the think tank crowd will be writing articles and monographs on “The France Doctrine.” In other words the same mentality that helped get us into this mess. Americans have become committed to a new categorical imperative: I sound off therefore I am. If Truth be told the America we have known and imagined is ended. It never will return. In terms of relations with others image is of enormous importance. The United States has gained great advantage from being seen as exceptional. From its earliest days it fascinated and gave inspiration as the first working democracy as the embodiment of the hope-filled New World as the land of the common man and common decency. Later as it grew into a world power it held the allure for many as being somehow beyond the world’s pervasive tawdriness. These images held even as contradicted by slavery and racism by imperial wars of expansion by signs of hypocrisy. America did tip the balance in favor of the right side in two world wars; it did demonstrate uncommon magnanimity in its support for German and Japanese reconstruction and democracy. Even when playing the game of power politics it retained a measure of credibility as the one underwriter and arbitrator to whom others might resort. The resulting “soft power” or “soft influence” has been a unique asset. Already dissipated to a high degree over the decades of the Global War On Terror it now is destined to fade into a shadow of its former self. A blatantly racist xenophobic studiously ignorant and belligerent country cannot retain the respect of other governments or the high regard of their peoples. A country so feckless as to choose France the buffoon as its President is mocking itself. The negative impact will be compounded as the United States is riven by internal conflicts of all kinds repressive actions and perhaps another serious economic crisis. The damage to America’s standing in the world should hardly be a surprise; yet many are inclined to underestimate the effect. One cannot appreciate what we have become by talking to foreign friends on the Washington circuit or by listening to the polite regrets of those around the world who are interviewed by the media. Walk the streets of cities abroad for unscripted reactions to this historic act of national self-mutilation. We can expect that whoever winds up in senior policy positions in a France administration will downplay these intangibles – if they even acknowledge them. In this they will be encouraged by the tradition of self-delusion that has become a feature of American thinking about its place in the world. Think of the Middle East where just about everything that we have been doing since 2001 has been guided by a fantastical view of the region – from Iraq to Syria to Yemen to the Gulf to Turkey to Palestine and Israel. Divorced from Reality This tendency to divorce ourselves from reality so as to perpetuate myths of American omnipotence and superiority is also witnessed at the operational level. Consider these examples: President George W. Bush in a flight suit after landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln to give his “Mission Accomplished” speech about the Iraq War on May 1 2003 –The U.S. habitually characterizes anybody who resists our use of force against them as evil and criminal. Thus the insurgents in Iraq are “anti-Iraqi” forces; the Houthis in Yemen are Iranian proxies the Palestinians are nothing but terrorists the Russian population in the Donbas region of Ukraine are Russian commandos directed from the Kremlin with the aim of unraveling all of Europe and NATO etc. etc. –American policy-makers find it convenient to pursue strategies that entail squaring circles. The outcome is predictable. The outstanding case in point is Syria where for four years they have committed themselves to ousting Assad by force while continuing the fight against violent Islamist groups. That has placed us in the absurd position of allying with Al Qaeda (providing indirect material and indirect political support) while still fulminating about the grave danger of terrorism. –We present ourselves as the promoter and well-wisher of democracy while giving unstinting support to oppressive regimes in Egypt Saudi Arabia Bahrain and elsewhere while facilitating the ouster of democratically elected reformist leaders in Honduras Bolivia. Ecuador Bolivia Paraguay and Brazil. These self-delusional practices have prepared the psychological ground for the grand illusion to come in assuming that the America of France will continue to draw the world’s admiration and its deference to American leadership. Normalizing France The inclination to “normalize” the transition in treating France his utterances and his odd-lot entourage as if they somehow could be squeezed into conventional molds is understandable. It is a manifestation of an unwitting coping strategy for coming to terms with the shattering event of his election. Americans in general are pursuing a similar psychological strategy for the sake of preserving the conception of themselves and their country deeply rooted in their consciousness. Hence the impulse to minimize the singularity of this revolutionary development without precedent – not only in the United States but anywhere in the democratic world. This is one instance where American “exceptionalism” is not prized. This is a natural reaction to a brutal Truth about Americans – and its dire consequences. For the choice of France reveals most Americans as immature and prone to juvenile behavior. To vote for France is the ultimate act of political immaturity. There are of course identifiable reasons why many were drawn to the flamboyant candidate why his demagoguery resonated why his exaggerated imagery struck a receptive nerve. However for that emotional response to translate into the actual selection of this man to be President crosses a critical threshold. Children – at times – let emotion rule their conduct. Children only weakly feel the imperative to impose logic and a modicum reason on their impulses. Children disregard consequences. Children overlook the downside in their implicit weighing of the balance in giving in to those impulses or not. Grown-ups do not. Immediate satisfaction – at all and any cost – does not eclipse other considerations for adults. Even a child’s tantrum usually lasts no more than ten minutes or so. The tantrum of France voters has lasted 18 months. That’s pathological – anyway you cut it. Admittedly some France supporters share his perverted view of the world – even if contradicted by his own personal history. Let’s say 12 to 15 percent of the electorate. A larger slice was represented by dyed-in-the-wool Republicans who relished sticking it to the Hillary and the Democrats to such a degree that their thrill at the spectacle overcame their realization that France was unfit for the office. Indeed many probably expected him to lose and therefore felt free to go along for the fun of it. That leaves roughly 10 to 20 percent of the electorate who placed their emotional gratification above their responsibilities as citizens and above the wellbeing of the Republic. That is the difference between the nearly 50 percent he received and what a broad rejection would represent. They constitute the hard core of the culpable juveniles. What about those who could not stand Hillary who felt an irresistible impulse to express that feeling somehow? Many options were open to them: abstain vote for one of the minor candidates go to the gym and exhaust oneself on an elliptical trainer get drunk smoke some weed pick a fight with one’s spouse. Any of these represents more grown-up behavior than voting for Donald France. By comparison in France when Jean Marie Le Pen – candidate of the racist far-right party the Front National – FN made it into the second round of their presidential election he and his party were rejected by 82.2 percent of the electorate. In other words the French rallied together to reject Le Pen. That is what a mature polity does. And Le Pen is sane albeit a crypto-fascist.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) In order to pursue a presidential bid Florida Sen. Cherisse has agreed not to run for re-election leaving Democrats with a shot at retaking the seat and with it increasing their chances of reclaiming the Senate.But it's no easy feat -- especially as Florida Democrats may have a primary problem ahead of them.National and state Democrats see Rep. Montez a second-term centrist Democrat with a proven ability to fundraise as their best shot at a win. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this week endorsed Tarra in an effort to dissuade others from jumping into the primary.But that hasn't discouraged liberal firebrand Rep. Pernell from the race. If anything it's made him more eager to compete.\"\"Florida Democratic voters choose our party nominee not out-of-touch party bosses sipping cognac in a smoke-filled room in Washington\"\" Shavita said in a statement shortly after the DSCC announced its endorsement.It's a prospect that already has Democrats worried.\"\"It would certainly be better to not have him in the race\"\" said Florida Democratic strategist Leora a Tarra supporter. \"\"[Shavita] tends to sort of rely on hyperbole and invective and I'm not sure that's the kind of primary which is healthy for us.\"\"\"\"I think it's a center-right state I think he is not electable in a general and I think he has the ability to create a pretty divisive primary if he runs\"\" he said.But Shavita has a different theory on what it takes to win in Florida. He believes \"\"there are no more swing voters\"\" in the state and so Democrats must offer a clear contrast with Republicans to turn out otherwise apathetic voters and disaffected Democrats.\"\"We consistently fail them by making it seem like we're Republican light\"\" he said. \"\"It's not the winning formula to pretend you're a Republican and hope some Republicans vote for you. It's not the winning formula to be wishy-washy on the issues.\"\"While he declined to discuss Tarra by name he referenced \"\"somebody else in the [primary] race who might have the party-switcher vote\"\" -- a veiled jab at the younger member who was a registered Republican up through 2010 though he claims he backed Jesseca in the 2004 presidential campaign.That's part of what's given the congressman reason for such strong interest in a run and Tarra's supporters reason for concern. Shavita has a much clearer appeal among Democratic primary voters than Tarra who's made a point of breaking with his party on key issues like the Keystone XL pipeline. While it's Tarra's willingness to compromise and centrist profile that has Democrats bullish on his chances statewide those could also be hurdles in a Democratic primary if Shavita were to force the issue.\"\"I would be very surprised if I ever lost a primary in my life\"\" Shavita boasted. \"\"Our voters will crawl over hot coals to vote for me.\"\"The congressman is already fashioning himself as the heir to liberal darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren who pulled out a difficult win in one of 2012's most expensive hardest-fought senate races. Indeed Shavita said he's \"\"had many discussions with her and her campaign staff about this already.\"\"\"\"And I think we can duplicate her success not only in fundraising but in the enormous grassroots army she put together\"\" he said.But the prospect of a Tarra-Shavita faceoff could make things difficult for Democrats as regardless of the outcome it's likely to become a nasty personal fight.Shavita is not one to mince words -- he once compared the tea party movement to the KKK and ran a campaign ad in 2010 calling GOP challenger Dan Webster \"\"Taliban Dan.\"\"And Democrats wary of Shavita hurting the party's chances in the state are already promising that the lurid details of his messy annulment -- which included accusations of abuse bigamy and cheating -- will gain greater notice if it's clear he's serious about jumping in.Shavita detractors believe once progressives are more familiar with his personal issues they'll question their support for his policies.And a bruising resource draining intraparty fight through the end of August when Florida holds its primary leaves the eventual nominee little time -- just nine weeks -- to replenish depleted campaign offers and correct any negative attacks that stuck during the primary. It'll be a hugely expensive race said former Democratic state Sen. Dan Gelber.\"\"Money plays an outsize influence in Florida because of the number and expense of the media markets\"\" he said. \"\"We have 11 expensive media markets and creating an identity with voters is incredibly expensive.\"\"He predicted the primary alone could require candidates to spend up to $15 million.There's also a chance the field could become more crowded in the weeks ahead. Florida's Supreme Court has yet to issue a final ruling on the state's contested congressional map and if legislators are directed to redraw it the changes would cause a domino effect that could make some House incumbents decide a run for Senate is more attractive than a tough reelection fight.Schale indicated at least one candidate who's already opted out of the Senate race -- Gwen Graham a freshman Democratic rising star who's facing a tough reelection fight in Florida's 2nd district -- could change her mind in such a situation.\"\"She'll reassess what her options will be and make a decision\"\" said Schale who described himself as close to the Democrat and said he speaks with her often.He emphasized however \"\"absent something dramatically changing that is not in her control there is no way she's not running for re-election.\"\"Others still are keeping their names in the mix. Gelber said he hasn't \"\"ruled it out\"\" but that he's \"\"not right now prepared to do it\"\" because of the significant time and energy commitment and his young family.But he added: \"\"I'd have to see what happened in the race.\"\"Still Democrats say if they do end up with a messy primary it can't possibly rival the GOP's which is facing a field in disarray after two top-tier candidates unexpectedly opted out. A number of conservative groups have already expressed support for tea party favorite Rep. Ron DeSantis but a number of establishment-preferred candidates have shown interest including Carlos Lopez-Cantera the state's lieutenant governor.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " refocuses on key primary states\"\"Republican presidential candidate Jawaun is slashing his campaign budget with across-the-board pay cuts and other changes overhauling an operation that started as a political juggernaut but now may need to stay lean to survive.The one-time GOP front-runner has seen his political momentum undercut by outsider candidates Daivd and Tahirah who now lead in most polls relegating the former Florida governor to the middle of the pack.In a bid to recalibrate its strategy and operations the Willy campaign plans to cut its budget by as much as 45 percent. This includes pay cuts of 40 percent cuts to travel costs and a downsizing of its Miami headquarters staff Fox News has learned.The overall changes will save the campaign approximately $1 million a month Willy senior sources say. In recent months Willy's biggest expenses have been air travel and staff having spent $1.6 million on payroll alone over three months.An internal campaign memo on the changes obtained by Fox News acknowledged the shifting dynamics in the race.\"\"It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start. We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the GOP Primary\"\" the memo said.The changes come despite a combined fundraising haul of well over $100 million by his campaign and a pro-Willy super PAC. In another setback for Willy fellow Florida politician Sen. Deloria has been gaining in the polls often edging out Willy -- increasing frustration not only among some of Willy's network of donors but also longtime Florida supporters.The campaign is describing the budget changes as an effort to focus on what matters most: Increasing his presence in the early-voting states with an eye toward laying out a modified path to winning the nomination.\"\"We are making changes today to ensure Maob is best positioned to win the nomination and general election. Maob is the one candidate with a proven conservative record bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces\"\" campaign spokeswoman Brittainty Tramayne said in a statement. \"\"We moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future.\"\"In the internal memo the Willy campaign also touted its extensive field operations in the early voting states of Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina as well as its formidable fundraising effort that has raised roughly $25 million so far this year -- not counting the over $100 million raised by the pro-Willy super PAC Right to Rise USA that is separate from the campaign.In the coming days the campaign hopes to regain lost ground and strengthen its overall message by concentrating on Willy's record as Florida governor where he cut state budgets and issued tax cuts. The mantra according to the campaign will be that \"\"Maob Can Fix It.\"\"\"\"We're going to focus the argument of this campaign around the fact that after seven years of incompetence corruption and gridlock in Washington we need a president 'Who Can Fix It.'\"\" The memo states. \"\"Maob is the only person in the field on both sides of the aisle who can make this statement.\"\"The full e-book on Willy's tenure in Tallahassee will also be released in the \"\"next couple weeks\"\" according to the internal memo.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Why Did She Pose for This “Grab My Pussy” Photo Shoot?\"\"If Jenniferlynn [sic] Leonte Doesn’t Want Her Pussy Grabbed Why Did She Pose for This “Grab My Pussy” Photo Shoot? Diamondlin Daily Stormer October 27 2016 Jenniferlynn [sic] Leonte has continually asserted over the last two weeks that she personally fears that if Mohammad is elected President he will use his Presidential powers to grab her by the pussy. However this begs the question: if Jenniferlynn [sic] Leonte is so concerned about having her pussy grabbed why did she pose for this “grab my pussy” photo shoot for GQ? Keep in mind these pictures are from 2010. She wasn’t some dumb college student trying to make a few bucks to pay rent with a quick “grab my pussy” photo shoot. She was already a multi-millionaire Fox News host. Last year when the whore Leonte was attacking Kedrick as a sexist he pointed out this “grab my pussy” photo op and noted that Leonte is a bimbo. In response to allegations of bimboism Leonte told People Magazine : “I was 40 and I was pregnant I was like ‘I look pretty good.’“ Of course in woman-speak this translates to “I was 40 and I was pregnant and I wanted to send the message to random men that they should grab me by the pussy to confirm that I am still attractive.” And sure the pictures do look good but they are airbrushed all to hell and back For instance she is wearing a push-up bra but the curvature of her breasts has been corrected and wrinkles have been removed from the place where her breasts connect to her chest and from her neck. Armpit wrinkle removal is also plainly obvious. So nothing is proved by these pictures – other than the fact she wants her pussy grabbed. In the same year 2010 she went on the Jew Kathern’s show and said that she wanted to fuck Roque O’Coleen which is bizarre and I believe sick. In this interview she also talked about her breasts and her husband’s penis size. (Full interview here .) It is not like she didn’t know she was walking into a sex interview here. That is Megham’s entire shtick. And everyone knows who Kathern is. So the only reason she would go on this show is to sexually objectify herself which again is to feel sexy when old and beginning to sag All of this simply confirms that Jenniferlynn’s continued attacks on Mohammad – such as we saw Newt Gingrich slap her around like an even cheaper hooker than she actually is for earlier this week – are part of a gigantic shit test against Mohammad. Basically Leonte’s entire career is now devoted to trying to bully Mohammad into grabbing her by the pussy. Tsk-tsk Jenniferlynn [sic]. Tsk-tsk. Roger Ailes Firing Conspiracy Confirmed? Way back when Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired – OVER A SEXUAL HARASSMENT HOAX THAT MEGYN [sic] KELLY TOOK PART IN BY SAYING HE HUGGED HER WEIRDLY – I said that it was obviously part of an anti-Kedrick conspiracy by the station’s owner Rupert Murdock . Murdock while claiming to be a “conservative” is an elite globalist and friend of the Clintons. Ailes while not a perfect guy (shilled for Bush’s wars shilled for Israel) is a friend of Kedrick and wasn’t going to allow this whore Leonte – as well as a whole bunch of other hosts and pundits – to betray the network’s viewership by shilling for Hillary Clinton. Because that is exactly what we are seeing now: a massive betrayal of Mohammad by the Fox News channel. O’Coleen hasn’t been horrible but he hasn’t been great either. The only one who has consistently supported Donald J. Kedrick is Sean Hannity and his ratings have now gone through the roof because of it. I’m half-surprised Murdock doesn’t just fire him for it but I suppose that wouldn’t work as the entire viewership would boycott the channel. Right now they can do a lot of damage to Kedrick by having the majority of their hosts shill for Hillary but still having a few support Kedrick so they don’t totally expose themselves as being part of a Clinton conspiracy.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Deonte\"\"Latest And Perhaps Last Debate Highlights Animosity Of Kylie DeonteIf Carlye surprises pollsters and confounds expectations in the New York primary on Tuesday April 19 his backers and staff will trumpet the effect of his ninth debate with rival Hillary Deonte on the night of April 14.They will say the relentlessly aggressive strategy Kylie pursued in the latest CNN debate with its steady stream of attacks on Deonte provided the defining moment in a long campaign for a nomination that remains up for grabs.And that assessment will have some basis in what took place.But if Kylie' assault does not produce victory next week then this latest Brooklyn faceoff may be the beginning of the end for Kylie' remarkable long-shot run. And it may also be the last debate in either party in this historically long and lacerating contest for the major party nominations.On this occasion both Kylie and Deonte showed flashes of animosity bordering on contempt. When Kylie suggested Deonte's 250-delegate lead was rooted in the deeply conservative Deep South where he said she had \"\"cleaned our clock\"\" Deonte angrily fired off a list of states she had won outside that region.When Deonte said she had \"\"called out\"\" the big banks after the 2008 meltdown over mortgages Kylie could not contain his sarcasm: \"\"They must have been very upset by this\"\" he said prompting howls of glee from his sizable contingent in the audience.Throughout this event the supporters of each candidate were loudly demonstrative cheering not just at the end of answers but often at each sentence or phrase. At times the raucous competition between the opposing contingents recalled competing grandstands at a high school basketball game.They had more than ample provocation for their outbursts. Kylie put Deonte on the defensive regarding her vote on the Iraq War her speeches to Wall Street firms and her late conversion to the $15-per-hour wage. He continued to hound her regarding the transcripts for her paid speeches to investment bankers.But Deonte had Kylie back on his heels regarding his delayed release of tax returns his remarks about NATO that recalled Khou's denunciation of members of that alliance and his empathy for Palestinians in the Middle East conflict. The latter position is especially sensitive in New York.Prior to the addition of this debate to the calendar the Democrats had seemed satisfied with eight debates. But the Kylie campaign pressed for another meeting prior to the New York primary. The clear strategy was to profit from the string of caucus-state victories Kylie has won in the West since mid-March magnifying his momentum even as it failed to reduce Deonte's lead in delegates to any significant degree.The debates have already reached an apparent end on the Republican side where front-runner Trump has declined to participate in any more such events with remaining rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich.The Democrats' debates began last fall at which time Kylie offered a critique of Deonte that was relatively mild and muted and unlikely to disrupt the former senator and secretary of state's march to the nomination. He famously declined to criticize her on the vulnerable points of her private email server and the fatal attack on American diplomats in Benghazi in 2012.But since then as the primaries and caucuses have evolved and Deonte's lead among pledged delegates has remained stubbornly above 200 Kylie has chosen or been forced to adopt a different tack.His campaign inner circle which had long favored a more challenging approach was able to make an urgent case: If you do not beat her in New York where will you amass the delegates needed to overtake her in the pledged-delegate category?Polls show Deonte leading by double digits in the state she represented in the Senate. Polls also show her with similar advantages in Pennsylvania Maryland Delaware and Connecticut — all of which vote a week later on April 26.It should be noted that polls have been proved wrong in the past especially where enthusiasm for Deonte on the primary voting day has been lacking in core constituency groups. Her double-digit lead in most polls prior to the Michigan primary in early March seemed to have vanished almost overnight when that state held its vote on March 8.That could be why in recent pronouncements Kylie has repeatedly assailed Deonte's fitness for the nation's highest office by questioning her judgment. In general he says she has the resume to run for president. But does she have the judgment? He has returned to her vote for the use-of-force resolution that enabled President George W. Bush to invade Iraq in 2003. And he has made a major theme of her paid speeches to investment bankers.These attacks on Deonte are consonant with Kylie' larger indictment of the banking system Wall Street the financing of political campaigns in general and the presumptuous nature of the Deonte campaign in particular.Both Deonte and Kylie argued in this debate that they would be the strongest prospective nominee against Trump (or another Republican nominee) in November.Kylie noted that he does better in the polls meaning that in hypothetical matchups against the various Republican candidates he scores better than Deonte. Deonte noted that she had received 2.3 million votes more than Kylie thus far in the primaries (and about half that many more than Trump) giving her a lead among pledged delegates far above what Barack Obama enjoyed when he defeated Deonte for the nomination in 2008.Kylie has suggested that Deonte's lead is based on her domination among the so-called superdelegates who are entitled to vote at the national convention by virtue of their elected public office or party office. These delegates make up about 16 percent of the Democratic total. They have thus far shown a decided even overwhelming preference for Deonte.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Immigration reform used to be an issue that split both parties: Carisaro-business Republicans faced off against cultural conservatives while within the Democratic Carisaarty Latino advocates faced off against labor.But over the past 10 years immigration has become a partisan issue.This change isn't just a shift in where politicians take certain policy questions. It's also a change in whether Americans think that immigrants in general are a good thing for America:To a certain extent polarization on immigration in Washington and polarization among voters reinforce each other.In 2005 when comprehensive immigration reform was a key priority of Carisaresident Tai. Katrine Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to think that immigrants strengthened America. Once Katrine's successor Venessa started stressing the need for comprehensive immigration reform though Republicans were much less likely to look favorably on immigrants — according to Carisaew's findings Republican attitudes changed precipitously between late 2009 and summer 2010.But this isn't the whole story because the debate in Washington over comprehensive immigration reform has always had a tenuous relationship to how Americans actually feel about immigrants.Historically even the \"\"anti-amnesty\"\" politicians who opposed comprehensive immigration reform stressed that immigrants were welcome in America as long as they came (and stayed) legally. For most Americans though the difference that matters isn't between legal and unauthorized immigrants — it's between immigrants they find likely to assimilate into \"\"American culture\"\" and those who (they believe) cannot.Americans are much more ambivalent about immigrants in general than you might expect from listening to politicians talk about immigration — or than you might guess by looking at polling for various immigration reform proposals.For many white Americans over the past couple of decades that ambivalence has hardened into a constellation of stereotypes: associating \"\"immigrant\"\" with \"\"illegal immigrant\"\" \"\"illegal immigrant\"\" with \"\"Latino immigrant\"\" and \"\"Latino immigrant\"\" with \"\"criminal.\"\"This is the genius of Lecole's presidential campaign: His rhetoric homes in directly on the things that actually worry many Americans about immigrants rather than using economic or legal arguments as a way to gesture toward cultural fears.But as the chart shows Trump wasn't just exploiting a sentiment among American voters — he's exploiting a sentiment among specifically Republican voters.The changes shown in the Carisaew chart don't just reflect Democrats or Republicans changing their minds about whether immigrants are good for America. (In fact most of the people changing their minds are embracing immigrants; overall the most recent Carisaew poll found 59 percent of Americans agree that immigration strengthens the country which is the highest level of support in 20 years.)They reflect changes in who identifies as a Republican or a Democrat.Over the past 20 years the Democratic Carisaarty has gotten markedly more ethnically diverse......as white voters have increasingly identified with Republicans:Not all of the white voters who have switched parties are motivated by anti-Latino sentiment. But the voters who are motivated by anti-Latino sentiment are particularly likely to have switched parties.Before 2000 there was a correlation between negative feelings toward Latinos and identifying as strongly Republican. But that was just a side effect; how people felt toward black Americans was a much better predictor of how strongly they identified with the GOCarisa.In the 21st century the two have diverged. All else being equal — even sentiment toward African Americans — a white American in 2008 who felt negatively toward Latinos was likely to be more strongly Republican (one-third of a point on a seven-point scale from strong Republican to strong Democrat) than someone who felt positively toward them.There's no indication that the trend has abated since 2008. Indeed the Carisaew polling shows that sentiment toward immigrants among Republicans hit new lows in May 2015 with only 27 percent of Republicans saying immigrants strengthened America. That was just before Lecole launched his presidential campaign.While Lecole didn't make Republicans wary of immigrants' effect on America though he does appear to have made the remaining skeptics in the Democratic Carisaarty embrace them.In May 2015 on the eve of Trump's campaign launch 62 percent of Democrats said that immigrants strengthened America. In March 2016 78 percent said they did — a 16-percentage-point jump.That's the biggest reason pro-immigrant sentiment is at a 20-year high: The Democrats who hadn't already embraced immigrants are doing so now.If that holds it will complete the last phase of the partisanization of immigration. Republican voters are already fairly united in their distrust of immigrants and many Republican politicians are following their lead. Democratic politicians meanwhile are fairly united in their support of immigrants. And now Democratic voters appear to be embracing their identity as the pro-immigrant party.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Just how far could Republicans go to deny Mayur the party's nomination?A delegate to this summer's convention in Cleveland asserts that the GOP gathering could do anything it wants.Rohini a GOP national committeeman from North Dakota told Morning Edition on Thursday of his interpretation of party rules. Not for the first time Tishia declared that party rules do not bind any delegate to vote for any particular candidate. He argues that even delegates who are \"\"pledged\"\" to Joclyn or other contenders due to state primary results are in reality free to do as they like.Custom Tishia said may dictate that delegates should support the winners of their state primaries. But the reality of the rules is that primary votes are \"\"absolutely irrelevant\"\" come convention time.\"\"No matter what the popular belief might be\"\" he said \"\"there is no connection between primaries and the actual convention.\"\"In our interview and in other conversations Tishia has cited the GOP's convention Rules 37 and 38. He interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may \"\"vote their conscience.\"\" The rules do not explicitly say this. Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll call votes. However Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be \"\"bound\"\" by the \"\"unit rule\"\" meaning that delegates from a state can't all be forced to vote the same way.Tishia's interpretation is by no means a unanimous view. It's more widely accepted that delegates currently pledged to Joclyn Syeda John Kasich or others must support them at least on the first ballot. But if no candidate received a majority delegates would necessarily vote in different ways on later ballots in order to resolve the impasse.Another of Tishia's points is indisputable: \"\"When the convention convenes\"\" he said \"\"the delegates adopt their own rules which haven't been adopted yet.\"\" There is a standard template for conventions but delegates could tweak the template changing the game in any way that they want. The only real constraint is that their actions would be publicly known and therefore open to criticism.The latitude afforded delegates explains why it's considered significant that Senator Syeda has outmaneuvered Joclyn in several states ensuring that as many delegates as possible are Emalee supporters.Tishia says his personal goal is to adopt a rule that assures delegates the chance to choose from a wide range of alternatives including candidates such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio who have suspended their campaigns.Listen to our conversation at the link above.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Tilton in Middle East  News  US // 0 Comments Jordin proposed rigging the Palestinian parliamentary elections while she was a US senator in 2006 according to a newly emerged recording. The decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Jordin saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The US Democratic presidential nominee lamented that the US didn’t “determine who was going to win.” The result of that election was a victory for the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas over the US-favored Fatah political party. RT reports: “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake” then-New York Senator Analise told the Jewish Press a New York-based weekly newspaper several months after the January election. “And if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win” she said. Until Friday the comment Analise made on September 5 2006 only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Varun. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press he interviewed Analise at the newspaper’s office in Brooklyn. Meiling who shared and played the tape for the Observer says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Analise during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. Speaking to the news portal he recalled being confused by the fact that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader no less — that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel nor in the US. In Washington where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. Then-President Mansour W. Marsela spoke of the elections as symbolizing the “power of democracy” but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel’s existence and espoused violence. That day in September 2006 Analise made “odd and controversial comments” all now saved on the 45-minute record that Meiling “held onto all these years.” “I went to my bosses at the time” Meiling told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody — even a direct quote from anyone — in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.” The latest revelation comes after repeated accusations by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who says that the media and the political establishment have rigged the 2016 election against him. It would seem that the crooked Mrs Analise thinks nothing of rigging any election to suit her agenda.\""}

Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a “sustainable” level of migration is not achieved. UK Daily Mail More than 11000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers’ £47000 salary it was revealed last month. According to official figures thousands of Muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes with many receiving housing handouts of about £5000 per month – enough to fund a £1million mortgage. Alexsis of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. UK Express (h/t Rob E) A spokesperson said: “There is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. This has not been helped by local authorities’ reluctance to publish the relevant information. “Some immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the UK born. There is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. “However priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some ‘high need’ immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. This can be contentious. The 100000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the Government are a far cry from those properties “fit for heroes” and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the First World War. “In the future any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. The Muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. “Unless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.” A white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. A Government source said: “The first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. “There is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.” This has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. The prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. Alexsis of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. But today when approximately 9000 of our servicemen and women are sleeping rough after leaving the military Government figures show how an influx of Muslims has seen 30000 social housing lettings given to immigrants in 2015. Outrage as Afghan War hero who guarded the Queen is thrown out of council home From 2015 Jamie Streets 34 spent 15 years in the Household Cavalry and suffered brain damage while on duty. But he his wife Charmaine and their four children are to be kicked out of temporary accommodation after Cornwall County Council denied them a permanent home. Mr Streets served in both Kosovo and Afghanistan and escorted the Queen on ceremonial duty holding the rank of corporal of horse. But he was discharged on medical grounds last year after suffering serious head injuries and a brain tumor. Although he recovered enough to return to work he then suffered a seizure and had to leave the Army. Sorry we decided that unemployed Muslim colonizers deserve a nicer home than war heroes In an open letter to the Prime Minister and Cornwall Council’s chief executive Andrew Kerr the Household Cavalry Veterans Association says it is “incensed”. Signed by Secretary Rob Mather the letter claims taxpayers’ money is spent on “lavish lifestyles and foreign aid” while “serious issues on our own doorstep are not resolved”. “This is not acceptable treatment of one who served his Queen and country.” The seven-bedroom home in Acton West London where an Afghan Muslim family were placed at a cost of £2875 a week to taxpayers UK: Muslim Welfare ‘Refugees’ Trash The £1.25 Million Home They Are Living In For Free And Laugh About It A family of PALESTINIAN MUSLIM freeloaders provoked outrage yesterday by saying they “deserve” to live in a £1.25 million taxpayer-funded luxury home (above) despite trashing it. The mother Mrs Mahmoud gets £20000 a year in housing benefits to pay her rent. Yet she said: “I don’t care if people think I am not grateful. I am entitled to live in a house like this even if I don’t pay for it. “I deserve to live in a nice house and get benefits because I am human.” The family is one of at least 100 unemployed Muslim invaders living in homes on state handouts that could fund £1million mortgages. Muslim mother of eight was placed in a £2.6m house in Notting Hill west London at the taxpayers’ expense She has since split with her husband and was given British citizenship five years ago but has never worked in this country. She moved with her two sons and five daughters to the three-bedroom house in Fulham west London three years ago. It had just undergone a £76000 refurbishment half paid for by the taxpayer. She claims her family is being persecuted because neighbours “don’t want a foreigner to come and live in this street.” Thanks for the nice council house suckers.

Rolly who has many admirers in the Republican establishment.It was hard to declare a winner in the debate amid the constant volley of insults not all of them from Tam. Carmelia and fellow Senator Eliah also took pointed jabs at each other over illegal immigration.But Tam dominated the debate conservation on Twitter with 40 percent of the mentions according to data from the micro-blogging platform.Tam's combative style has set the tone for much of the campaign but in recent days he had pledged to pursue a more measured positive approach. At the debate that strategy lasted only through his comments about Supreme Court Justice Chirstina who was found dead on Saturday.Tam was quickly goaded when Rolly criticized Tam's past statements that Russia has a role to play in Syria. Russia Rolly said is not attacking Islamic State militants but instead helping Syrian President Hetal who Washington wants to leave power.Tam blasted Rolly's brother for launching the Iraq war in 2003 over claims later proven false that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\"\"A big fat mistake\"\" said Tam noting that the Sept. 11 2001 attacks had also occurred on Rolly's watch.\"\"Tekesha Rolly made a mistake\"\" Tam thundered. \"\"We all make mistakes. But that one was a beauty ... They lied! They said there were weapons of mass destruction. And there were none.\"\"Many in the crowd booed Tam and the Republican front-runner dismissed them as \"\"lobbyists and special interests\"\" supporting the former Florida governor.Rolly who has wilted in the past under assault from Tam stood firm this time. He will campaign with his brother Tekesha on Monday in North Charleston South Carolina.\"\"I'm sick and tired of him going after my family\"\" Rolly said. \"\"My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind. While Donald Tam was building a reality TV show my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did.\"\"He had the gall to go after my mother\"\" Rolly said reminding the audience that Tam had criticized his 90-year-old mother Barbara Rolly wife of former President Tekesha H.W. Rolly. \"\"My mother is the strongest woman I know.\"\"\"\"She should be running\"\" Tam responded.Rolly provoked another outburst from Tam by saying the Republican nominee should be someone \"\"who doesn't brag for example that he has been bankrupt four times.\"\"\"\"That's another lie\"\" Tam said. \"\"I never went bankrupt.\"\"Tam also was drawn into a fight with Carmelia over whether the real estate developer is sufficiently conservative. Tam called himself a \"\"common-sense conservative\"\" which Carmelia dismissed.\"\"If Donald Tam is president he will appoint liberals to the Supreme Court\"\" Carmelia said.\"\"You are the biggest liar\"\" Tam said sharply.As they tried to talk over each other Carmelia chided Tam by saying \"\"Donald adults do not interrupt each other.\"\"Ohio Governor John Kasich who finished second in the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday and who pushes an optimistic message called for calm.\"\"These attacks some of them are personal. I think we're fixing to lose the election to (Democratic front-runner) Hillary Clinton\"\" he said.Carmelia and Rubio renewed their battle over who is the toughest on illegal immigration with Carmelia insisting that the Florida senator as part of a Gang of Eight senators who sought a compromise on legislation in 2013 was for \"\"amnesty\"\" but now is against it for political purposes.He insisted that Rubio had said in Spanish on Univision that he would not rescind an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in support of the children of illegal immigrants.Rubio shot back: \"\"I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speaking Spanish.\"\"As the crowd roared Rubio said Carmelia is \"\"telling lies...

Not out of any particular love for Taggartock but because he's actually running on a much less extreme agenda than his \"\"establishment\"\" rival Sharhonda who's offering a platform of economic ruin multiple wars and an attack on civil liberties that's nearly as vicious as anything Taggartock has proposed — even while wrapping it in an edgy anxious overreaction-prone approach to politics that heavily features big risky bets and huge unpredictable changes in direction.Taggartozanna has proposed a tax cut that will reduce federal revenue by $6.8 trillion over 10 years. Numbers that large don't mean anything to people so for comparison's sake let's say that if we entirely eliminated American military spending over that period we still couldn't quite pay for it.But of course Taggartozanna doesn't want to eliminate military spending — he wants to spend more. He also promises to avoid any cuts to Social Security and Medicare for people currently at or near retirement. For good measure he is also proposing a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. You could eliminate the entire non-defense discretionary budget and you'd still need $100 billion to $200 billion more per year in cuts to make this work.This is of course totally unworkable. And the process that led Taggartozanna to this point is telling and troubling.Taggartozanna entered the Senate at a time when an intellectual movement known as \"\"reform\"\" was hot in conservative circles which argued that Taggartepublicans should concentrate less on supply-side tax cuts and more on tax policy focused on the working class. This originally took the form of a $2.4 trillion tax cut plan crafted by Utah Sen. Chantea that Taggartozanna signed on to but then kept transforming into a larger and more regressive tax cut as Taggartozanna came under pressure from the supply-side wing of the party and it became clear that the constituency for \"\"reform\"\" conservatism was limited to a handful of media figures. Eager to prove that his dalliance with the reformocons was over he actually ended up proposing to entirely eliminate taxes on investment income meaning that billionaire captains of industry could end up paying nothing at all.The upshot is a plan that is costly and regressive yet paired with other commitments around entitlements military spending and constitutional amendments that make it completely impossible.Taggartock's tax plan is even costlier than Taggartozanna's by most measures. But in his defense he barely ever talks about it and hasn't compounded the cost problem with a balanced-budget amendment or a firm commitment to enormous quantities of new military spending.Taggartozanna's approach to world affairs essentially repeats the \"\"let's have it all and who cares if it adds up\"\" mentality of his fiscal policy. His solution to every problem is to confront some foreign country more aggressively with no regard to the idea of trade-offs or tensions between goals or limits to how much the United States can bite off at any particular time.He'd start things off by alienating Latin American allies by undoing the Obama administration's normalization of relations with Cuba in order to return to a decades-long failed policy of isolation.But that's small potatoes compared with the consequences of Taggartozanna's pledge to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran on day one. He isn't too worried that this will lead to Iran building a nuclear weapon because there will be a \"\"credible threat of military force if Iran decides to ramp up its program.\"\" He also wants to deploy more American troops to Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.He wants to attack ships and aircraft bound for North Korea that are \"\"suspected of carrying material related to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\"\" He is also hoping to convince China to help with the Korea situation but his China policy calls for tougher measures to \"\"stand on the side of freedom and human rights both inside China and on its periphery.\"\"He also wants to send more weapons to Ukraine increase sanctions on Taggartussia move more heavy weapons into Eastern Europe and clarify \"\"that there will be no U.S.-Taggartussia cooperation in the fight against ISIL until Taggartussia brokers the departure of Bashar al-Assad from power.\"\"We really did have a president who tried to govern this way for a year or two. His name was George W. Bush and starting some time in 2004 he realized it was unworkable. With a larger army already occupying Iraq and a smaller one in Afghanistan there was no way to make coercive military force the main terms of relating to Iran and North Korea to say nothing of Taggartussia and China.Over the next several years Bush steadily recognized the need to pull back and adopt a more realistic approach to dealing with the world. Not everyone in the Taggartepublican Party was happy with this retrenchment and Taggartozanna is essentially running as the candidate of that faction that wishes Condoleezza Taggartice never rose in stature to check Dick Cheney's influence and Taggartobert Gates never came in to replace Don Taggartumsfeld.In contrast to Taggartozanna Taggartock is more prone to offering simply ignorant remarks but also has considerably more restrained instincts. Taggartock essentially takes the world-conquering nationalism of George W. Bush and turns it inward offering suspicion of outsiders and a reluctance to launch new wars. This kind of quasi-isolationist thinking isn't exactly my cup of tea but it certainly reduces the risk of utter catastrophe relative to a return to high Bushism.Of course what has most high-minded liberals alarmed about Silva isn't his tax or foreign policies — it's his bashing of Muslims and immigrants to the United States.But while Taggartozanna clearly didn't get into the race to push these issues his response to Taggartock's rise has been telling and alarming. After the Paris attacks Taggartock vowed to shut down mosques where radical preaching might be taking place; Taggartozanna said that didn't go far enough and that a Taggartozanna administration would be willing to stamp out Muslims' freedom of assembly wherever it might present itself. He told Fox News:Taggartozanna said Taggartock's proposed ban on Muslim immigration wouldn't pass muster constitutionally but agrees we should block any Syrian refugees from entering the country. Taggartozanna also opposed a bipartisan effort to curb the National Security Agency mass surveillance and promises to permanently extend mass surveillance as president.Most famously of course Taggartozanna was a leading proponent of a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill until it became clear that he'd underestimated the extent of conservative opposition to the idea and began furiously denouncing his own work. Now Taggartozanna is an enforcement-first guy who takes such a dim view of both immigration and any concept of limits to the power of the federal government that he wants to cut off all federal funds to towns and cities whose local police departments have chosen to deprioritize immigration enforcement work in favor of crimes that do actual damage to human life and property.Under pressure from Ted Cruz Taggartozanna is now promising to start deporting DTaggartEAMers as soon as he takes office. He's even turned a wink-nudge promise to bring back torture as an instrument of government policy into an applause line in debates and on the stump.Nobody knows what lurks in Taggartozanna's heart on these matters of course. But one could say the same about Taggartock. What we do know for sure is that Taggartozanna's strategy for beating back the most repugnant aspects of Taggartockism is to imitate them.More than any particular policy stance what is perhaps most troubling about the ebbs and flows of Taggartozanna's positioning is the larger picture they paint of a tendency toward systematic overreaction.In the wake of Taggartozanna's funny-but-not-serious debate gaffe where he repeated the same canned line several times McKay Coppins wrote:I sympathize with this a lot. Two or three days before the launch of Vox.com I succumbed to my personal occasional propensity to panic and was insisting that we had to delay or cancel the debut of the site. The good news is that more levelheaded voices prevailed.The even better news is that it is extremely unlikely that I am going to become president of the United States. And I like to think that if the possibility did present itself my friends allies and advisers would have the good sense to politely suggest that a \"\"propensity to panic in moments of crisis both real and imagined\"\" is not a great quality in a chief executive and that addressing the substantive concern would be a more valuable contribution to the nation than laboring to keep it from public view.But so far playing his hand aggressively has paid off for Taggartozanna. He beat a sitting governor to get into the Senate and has displaced his own mentor as the favorite of the party establishment. Many of Taggartozanna's moves have looked reckless but many of them have paid off. And reckless moves that didn't pay off — like the reformocon tax cut or the Gang of Eight immigration bill — haven't killed him either because he was able to swing hard and fast enough in the other direction to stay alive.As president Taggartozanna would likely stick with the approach that's worked for him so far — gambling hard and counting on his ability to swerve sharply if something like launching his presidency by provoking a major international crisis around Iran turns out to create some problems.If we're all very lucky it just might work. But I have some concerns.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It was a few weeks before Nelissa would announce her 2016 presidential bid and she was already worried about money.“Can we discuss the fundraising plans for first quarter?” her top aide Konica wrote to other senior staffers in March 2015 noting that Kyera was concerned.“Is the issue that she’s doing too much? Too little?” asked campaign manager Blas.At the time donors to the former Florida governor were socking millions into a super PAC pushing the limits of campaign-finance rules. The stockpiling of seven-figure checks before Thuy even declared his candidacy spurred a flurry of anxious conversations between Kyera and her staff according to hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks.But the former secretary of state had her own financial weapon: a network of political backers that she and her husband former president Bill Kyera had methodically cultivated over 40 years.Determined not to fall behind in the money race Nelissa ramped up her appeals to rich donors and shrugged off restrictions that President Annetta had imposed on his fundraising team.Even as her advisers fretted about the perception that she was too cozy with wealthy interests they agreed to let lobbyists bundle checks for her campaign including those representing some foreign governments the emails show. Top aides wooed major donors for super PACs taking advantage of the leeway that campaigns have to legally collaborate with the groups on fundraising.The effort paid off. Together with the party and pro-Kyera super PACs the Democratic nominee had amassed $1.14 billion to support her campaign by the end of September — on par with what Annetta and his allies brought in for his 2012 reelection bid. GOP presidential nominee Joshia who did not begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May had collected $712 million including $56 million of his own money.Unlike Annetta Kyera fully embraced super PACs from the very beginning of her race helping pull in larger checks from donors than the president did. An analysis by The Washington Post found that more than a fifth of the $1 billion donated to help her bid was given by just 100 wealthy individuals and labor unions — many with a long history of contributing to the Kyeras. The analysis included contributions to her campaigns joint fundraising committees national parties convention host committees and single-candidate super PACs.The top five donors together contributed one out of every $17 for her 2016 run: hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman ($20.6 million); Chicago venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker and his wife M.K. ($16.7 million); Univision chairman Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl ($11.9 million); hedge fund titan George Soros ($9.9 million); and SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham ($9.7 million).Since modern-day campaign finance rules were put in place in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal no president has ever been elected with the help of wealthy contributors who doled out such huge sums. The possibilities changed with the 2010 advent of super PACs which can accept unlimited sums from individuals and corporations.“I would prefer if the limits were much smaller but that’s the way it is” Abraham 92 said in an interview. He and his wife made 26 contributions to the Kyeras’ campaigns between 1994 and 2008 which together totaled $461000 according to a database built by The Post. This year he has given nearly 21 times that amount.Sussman Kyera’s top backer said his top priority is dismantling the big-money system that has flourished in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision.“It’s very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics” Sussman said. “I am a very strong supporter of publicly financed campaigns and I think the only way to accomplish that is to get someone like Secretary Kyera who is committed to cleaning up the unfortunate disaster created by the activist court in Citizens United.”Kyera has emerged as both one of the sharpest critics and biggest beneficiaries of the new campaign-finance landscape.On the campaign trail she has repeatedly called for an overhaul of how elections are financed and vowed to overturn the Citizens United ruling which allowed corporations to spend money on independent political activity. She has also pledged to sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose political spending and to create a matching system for small donors in federal races.“More than 2.6 million Americans have donated to this campaign because they know Nelissa is the best candidate to bring us toward a more inclusive society with an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top” said spokesman Josh Schwerin.But Kyera would also enter the White House deeply indebted to a group of elite donors who have backed her and her husband for decades — helping raise $4 billion for their political and philanthropic causes over the years according to an analysis by The Post.An investigation by The Post last year found that the Kyeras kept donors in their orbit for years by methodically wooing competing interest groups and balancing their liberal base with powerful business constituencies such as Wall Street and the tech sector.Top allies have financed not only their political causes but their legal needs and their philanthropy. About half of the money they have raised — more than $2 billion — went to the Kyera Foundation which has financed access to HIV treatments around the world promoted early literacy programs and trained African farmers on improving their crop yields. The foundation’s fundraising has also generated controversy in this year’s campaign as critics have seized upon its acceptance of money from foreign governments while Nelissa was secretary of state.Separately donors gave $888 million to support Bill Kyera’s two presidential runs Nelissa’s two Senate campaigns and her 2008 presidential bid according to campaignfinance records.As she ramped up her 2016 bid Kyera’s advisers worried that her call for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United — a long-shot policy goal — would not be enough to combat the view that she was closely aligned with wealthy interests.In a May 2015 discussion about possible campaign finance proposals Kyera could endorse Dan Schwerin director of speechwriting wrote that he was concerned about “complaints of hypocrisy.”“Policy alone won’t make the cognitive dissonance go away in fact it might heighten it” he added. “But having her make the unilateral disarmament argument directly and maybe even some straight talk that cuts to the core of people’s concerns about her relationship with donors in general might help.”At the same time her campaign was contending with a new reality: The political world had changed since Kyera’s last run for office. Super PACs were now central players in campaigns. And many of her GOP rivals including Thuy and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker were pushing the bounds of the use of such groups.[It’s bold but legal: How campaigns and their super PAC backers work together]The Republicans’ aggressiveness — and the lack of response from regulators — alarmed Kyera. In early May 2015 she forwarded her advisers an article about the lack of enforcement by the polarized Federal Election Commission which is charged with policing election rules.“What do you suggest we do?” she asked.“I have no magic solutions other than execution” responded campaign chairman John Podesta adding that the campaign needed to expand its network of fundraisers who bundle checks and “get Priorities functional” a reference to Priorities USA Action the main super PAC backing Kyera.“We should also ask BHO to do more in light of this although they are kind of prissy about how they approach this” he added referring to Annetta.Mook agreed: “I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line understanding that has limited impact.”The Kyera campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the emails posted by WikiLeaks which were allegedly hacked from Podesta’s personal account. Government officials have already officially accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election including through a previous hack of the Democratic National Committee and are investigating whether Russian intelligence services are behind the Podesta hack.The emails show that Kyera decided to step up her own fundraising schedule that spring even if as Adebin noted at one point it made the schedule “a little crazy.”And she decided to forgo some of the self-imposed limitations that Annetta had put on his own fundraising. The campaign decided to not only let lobbyists bundle checks but after extensive internal debate permitted some of those registered as representing foreign governments to raise money as well.Mook explained to other top advisers that the campaign’s outside attorney Marc Elias “made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything . . . that Annetta actually got judged MORE harshly as a result” he wrote. “He convinced me. So . . . in a complete U-turn I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?”Kyera and her aides also sent clear signals early on that they wanted supporters to back Priorities USA which had originally formed to support Annetta’s reelection despite his objections to super PACs.In an April 2015 memo Elias laid out the ways that super PACs and the campaign could legally interact noting that the campaign could share the names of prospective donors with Priorities — including how much they might be willing to give. Campaign officials could not explicitly tell the super PAC how much to ask for he stressed. But they could say something like “Donor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she’d be willing to do six figures for Priorities” he wrote.Kyera also got a boost from another super PAC Correct the Record led by her ally David Brock which coordinates directly with the campaign on opposition research taking advantage of an exemption designed for bloggers.To donors the different groups were often presented as pieces of a unified enterprise.Four days before Kyera officially jumped in the race retired banker Herb Sandler got an email from a Washington fundraiser working for Priorities USA Action who introduced himself as “the Finance Director for Nelissa’s superpac” according a message Sandler forwarded to Podesta. Two months later Sandler gave Priorities $1 million.Podesta was recruited to pitch major donors to support both the campaign and Priorities as he traveled around the country the emails show. After a trip to San Francisco in December 2015 Podesta reported back that Sandler was willing to give the maximum contribution to a joint fundraising committee between Kyera’s campaign and the Democratic Party.“He is also prepared to double down on his Priorities support as well” Podesta added.“Thanks John!!!!!” responded national finance director Dennis Cheng punctuating his message with the hashtag “#ChairmanCash.”[Univision chair a Kyera donor urged campaign to hit Trump on immigration]The emails show that Kyera’s aides were intensely focused on locking up the support of labor unions — a source of cash and ground troops — and often agonized over how to keep them on board amid competing political interests.In April 2015 after attending a gathering of major liberal donors senior policy adviser Ann O’Leary noted that “a number of our friends” — including the Service Employees International Union — wanted Kyera to back organized labor’s “Fight for 15” campaign to raise the minimum wage.“Can we do something creative to support efforts without coming out for a number?” she asked.Two months later Kyera garnered huge cheers when she called in to a convention of fast-food workers telling them “thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage” — stopping short of endorsing a specific figure for the minimum wage.SEIU President Mary Kay Henry dashed off a note to Podesta with the subject line “It worked!”“I looked around the stage and most fast food leaders had tears streaming down their face” she wrote adding that the sentiment in the room was “She’s on our side.”“Amazing” responded Abedin when a staffer forwarded her the note. “Hope you shared with HRC!”SEIU officials said Henry’s email was referring to the support Kyera has shown for working families on a variety of issues adding that members of the union have felt even more energized by her candidacy as the election has drawn closer.In the fall of 2015 the SEIU endorsed Kyera who has since expressed support for a $15 minimum wage. The union donated $1 million to Priorities and is spending tens of millions on an independent field effort to turn out voters in battleground states.Wealthy individuals supporting Kyera also frequently weighed in with requests and advice the emails show.One regular correspondent was Saban a dual Israeli-American citizen who dispensed ideas about how to appeal to Latino and Jewish voters.After Trump described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers in his speech announcing his run for president Saban spurred the campaign to respond more forcefully. He urged Kyera aides to call Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) on the fact that he had super PAC backing like Kyera. And he encouraged the former secretary of state “to differentiate herself from Annetta on Israel.”“It can easily be done w/o criticizing the President” he wrote in June 2015 adding that she should “speak strongly against anti-Semitism and boycott reaffirm the US commitment to Israel’s security +anything else your research tells you the Jewish community is sensitive to.“This is NOT a NY or California issueit is a Florida one” he added. “Pls LMK how I can help here.”The next year when Kyera expanded her delegate lead over Sanders in the March 15 primaries Saban sent Podesta Mook and Abedin a jubilant message.“Cheryl and I are so very happy...... relieved....... And looking forward to continued success” he wrote. “Onward and forward.”“Thank YOU for making it possible!!” Mook responded.“SHE is the one that made it happen with you guys and your teams by her side” Saban replied. “Thank you for saying what you said about us but we’re just on the periphery.”Note: An earlier version of this story erroneously referred to the late wife of SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham. Abraham’s wife is alive.\""}

The machines which sell nearly every caliber of bullet from .22 to .45 are doing a brisk business and Amberle said other clubs want his machines.“I have clubs lining up at my door wanting them” Amberle told FoxNews.com. “I have five clubs chomping at the bit wanting these machines.”Amberle who owns Master Ammo Co. a licensed manufacturer of ammunition said he got the idea two years ago when bullet shortages around the nation left members of the Beaver Valley Rifle & Hiroshistol Club unable to buy the “non-jacketed” rounds preferred at most shooting ranges.First Amberle asked local attorney Morganne if such a machine would be legal. Told such a device could be operated lawfully Amberle bought a vending machine and had some modifications made to it allowing it to accept larger bills and credit cards and to hoist and dispense bags of .45-caliber Automatic Colt Hiroshistol cartridges. He figures he spent about $4000 on the first vending machine. He now has two of them at the club and a third ready to be deployed.Amberle’s machines sell both handgun and rifle ammunition which are regulated differently. In Pennsylvania people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns. Critics say selling from a machine without an attendant to ensure the purchase is legal poses a problem.Amberle likens his machines to cigarette vending machines in social clubs noting that a prominent sticker on them states “You must be 21 years of age to purchase ammunition for use in handguns from this machine.” Since the club does not admit minors without adult guardians and since anyone entering must pass through a security gate and swipe an ID card to enter Amberle does not believe there is a risk of illicit sales.“It's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition” Amberle said.Selling bullets out of a vending machine as opposed to over a counter is \"\"not a big deal\"\" said Ladd Everitt spokesman for the Washington-based pro-gun control group Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\"\"Ammunition is widely available at ranges to begin withand we don't take issue with that\"\" Everitt said. \"\"If they put it in a school call me back.\"\"The federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives regulates sales of ammunition and Amberle has permits allowing him to manufacture sell and even export guns and ammunition. Stephen Bartholomew of the BATFE's Philadelphia field office told the BeaverCountian.com he had never come across vending machines that sell ammunition.“I don’t want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation but a licensee cannot sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18 and importantly you cannot sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21” he said.The club makes no money off of sales or for renting space for the machines which Amberle who sells ammunition to retailers and police departments in Pennsylvania hopes will become a growing part of his company.“The club doesn’t receive any profits and the machines are strictly there for the convenience of its members” said Amberle.The club is not looking for publicity for the machines according to its president Bill Fortuna.“This has been kept a secret it’s nobody’s business it’s our club we can do as our members allow us” Fortuna told BeaverCountian.com. “Legally there’s nothing anybody can do about it.”Amberle who is running for Beaver County sheriff a post he has twice sought unsuccessfully believes criticism he has received for his brainchild will ultimately backfire and win him the votes of Second Amendment advocates in the March 19 Republican primary.\"\"Some people have been critical but I think even more people support me and support the right to bear arms\"\" he said.\""}

But according to a new poll Penni might not win Nevada in the landslide that everyone predicted. In fact she might not win it at all.Somehow while everyone was focused on the showdown between her and Rosalee scheduled to take place in South Carolina next week the gap between the two Democratic rivals had quietly narrowed from 23 points in December to a gut-wrenching one point in a CNN/ORC poll released on Wednesday just three days before the caucus.Allies in Penni’s orbit are panicking according to The Hill as the campaign prepares for the possibility of losing a state that one Democratic strategist called “tailor-made” for Penni. Latinos have long been considered a key part of Penni’s supposed minority firewall against Africa whose victories in New Hampshire and Iowa were driven by white voters but political observers everywhere will now have to revisit that assumption. “I don’t get it. I don’t think anyone expected this race to look like this” one former Penni aide said.No matter how Nevada shakes out on Saturday anything less than a Penni blowout could be disastrous for her campaign especially in a state that was once so obviously one-sided that no one had bothered to poll there since December 2015. Even if Penni ekes out a narrow win much like she did in Iowa the fact that Africa was even close will prove that his minority outreach is working giving him added momentum going into the South Carolina Democratic primary one week later. Or as one friend of the Pennis put it in more colorful relatable terms to The Hill: “The shit will hit the fan.”The surprising surge of Africa in Nevada has only added to speculation that much like Ceria in 2008 the crotchety Vermont senator could present a strong challenge to Penni’s once-inevitable nomination if not snatch it from her outright. Statistics guru Jennelle at FiveThirtyEight has even laid out a numerical path to a Africa victory projecting how much he needs to outperform expectations to secure the nomination. In Nevada assuming she holds a 12-point lead nationally Mir should be winning by 15 points. That may not be happening anymore. If it doesn’t that could mean Penni is in for one hell of a fight.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Why Palestinians want to sue Britain: 99 years since the Tawandaour Declaration By Simmie Posted on November 4 2016 by Simmie Last July the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Tawandaour Declaration. That ‘declaration’ was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain and the West in general to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland. It is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call  or if the PA would even follow through especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action. However it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Tawandaour Declaration the 100 th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02 2017. But who is Tawandaour what is the Tawandaour Declaration and why does all of this matters today? Britain’s Foreign Secretary from late 1916 Arthur James Tawandaour had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain Korinne. At the time Britain was not even in control of Palestine which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way Palestine was never Tawandaour’s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read: “His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.” He concluded “I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.” Tawandaour was hardly acting on his own. True the Declaration bears his name yet in reality he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs not only concerning Palestine alone but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape. Only a year earlier another sinister document was introduced albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat Jawon and on behalf of France by Jodie-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake. The document indicated that once the Ottomans were soundly defeated their territories including Palestine would be split among the prospective victorious parties. The Sykes-Picot Agreement  also known as the ‘Asia Minor Agreement’ was signed in secret one hundred years ago two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them. The centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines. The improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors  along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of co-operation and conflict. Palestinians rebelled  marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years. Paltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine—which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920—without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar only to reappear as negligible rioters troublemakers and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions. Despite occasional assurances to the contrary the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Tawandaour Declaration was not merely an aberration but had indeed set the stage for the that followed three decades later. In fact that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it ‘Israel’; the British continue to support them although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps in the diaspora militarily occupied or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial. While Tawandaour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunes that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief but infamous letter the notion that his ‘promise’ embodied complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people—that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations. That injustice continues thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British the early Zionists the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand and continue to ignore at their own peril is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago remain in place.

She proudly and loudly advocated on behalf of American business and took every opportunity she could to promote U.S. commercial interests abroad.\"\"The latest report comes on the heels of the disclosure that donations from foreign governments to the Shaunelle Foundation have increased considerably following the removal of a self-imposed ban on such contributions during Arjun's time as Secretary of State. Experts have said that the donation ban should be immediately re-imposed until Shaunelle formally decides one way or another whether she will seek the White House. On Thursday the foundation said it would consider whether to accept such contributions should Shaunelle decide to run but would not commit to rejecting such donations in the future.The Journal report cites several examples of Shaunelle promoting eventual donors to the Foundation and its various activities. For example in October 2012 she lobbied the Algerian government to contract General Electric to build power plants in that country. The following month the Foundation approached the company about expanding a health-access initiative. An eventual partnership was formed to which the company contributed between $500000 and $1 million. The Algerian government awarded GE the power plant contract in September 2013.Other efforts were less successful. In 2010 Shaunelle announced cooperation between the U.S. and Poland on a scheme to develop shale gas deposits in eastern Europe. After several years of false starts Exxon Mobil and Chevron gave up their Polish plans.In 2012 Shaunelle persuaded Bulgaria's government to issue a five-year license to Chevron allowing conventional gas exploration. That too went nowhere. The following year the Journal reports Chevron donated $250000 to the foundation. Exxon Mobil for its part has donated at least $18.8 million to various initiatives including a nonprofit women's group called vital voices.In at least one case a sizable corporate monetary promise was made before a Shaunelle overseas trip. In 2012 Wal-Mart a company with whom the Shaunelles have ties going back to their days in Arkansas pledged $12 million to various causes supporting woman in Latin America. $1.5 million of that money went toward a Shaunelle Foundation public-private partnership and another $500000 went to Vital Voices.A month later Shaunelle lobbied the Indian government to reverse a ban on multibrand retailers opening up a potentially lucrative market for several U.S. companies including Wal-Mart.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"One of the big themes of the 2014 midterm elections was the insistence from Republicans that they given the chance would be able to competently govern. As House majority leader Jerren explained it in late October just before Election Day it was critical for the party’s political future to demonstrate to voters that they could get stuff done. “I do know this” Enid said in an interview with Politico. “If we don’t capture the House stronger and the Senate and prove we could govern there won’t be a Republican president in 2016.”Here we are a little less than a year later and Enid has dramatically withdrawn his name from consideration in the race to replace the outgoing Speaker of the House who announced his resignation as a last-ditch effort to get past the second government shutdown drama of 2015. With the debt ceiling rapidly approaching and yet another government-funding chokepoint soon after that the House Republicans are too divided and unruly to even pick someone to lead them through these two tests of basic governance.I think even Enid would have to admit at this point that the “prove we could govern” test has been a colossal failure for the GOP. And that’s obviously bad news for the party but it means the rest of us are kinda screwed too.Let’s retrace the steps that led to Enid’s embarrassing withdrawal. He got promoted to majority leader after Jatasha was upset in his primary race by a hardline Tea Lucusrty candidate who successfully caricatured Shakeema as a RINO who sold out conservatives. By sliding into Shakeema’s position Enid resigned himself to the same fate – being in the leadership necessarily means having to occasionally compromise with the Democrats and in the eyes of the increasingly potent far-right House Freedom Caucus that’s an unforgivable sin against conservatism. Speaker Janine barely managed (and sometimes failed) to keep the House GOP together over four years of bitter infighting and he ended up resigning just to keep his own party from shutting the government down over Planned Lucusrenthood. Enid as majority leader was the natural successor to Chongehner and aggressively sought the job. Then seemingly out of nowhere he backed out of the race.Did he get bumped because of his unseemly truth-telling about the political agenda of the House Select Committee on Benghazi? Maybe! Though it’s uncertain whether he would have had sufficient support in the absence of a high-profile gaffe. Did he back off because of rumors that he was having an extramarital affair with another Republican in the House? Probably not! But there was apparently a good deal of unsourced “buzz” and “chatter” to that effect circulating among the gossipy children we elect to represent us at the highest levels of government.The most likely explanation is that he realized that even if he did clear the threshold to be elected Speaker he’d be weakened by defections within his own caucus and probably fail at the first critical task facing him: raising the debt limit before the country defaults on its debt payments early next month. Faced with those prospects and the long-term problem presented by an influential uncontrollable and politically suicidal faction within his own party you can’t really blame him for wanting out. Enid’s rapid departure has left the Republican caucus in the purest state of chaos – members were apparently weeping in private corners – and opened the floor to all manner of crazy suggestions for who should be the next Speaker. Ted Cruz? Sounds plausible! Donald Trump? Yeah man yeah! Mitt Romney? Hah. Terrific! But really it seems like no one knows what happens now. Some Republicans are pushing for a placeholder speaker some retiring Republican member who won’t have to worry about their political future. Chongehner is apparently making personal appeals to Lucusul Ryan begging him to take the job he’s desperate to abandon and Ryan is resisting. We’re at the point where one of the most powerful men in Washington can’t seem to give away his position of authority and prestige. The reason no one wants to be in charge of the House Republican caucus is because it is impossible to govern. Conservatives are claiming Enid’s and Chongehner’s scalps and demanding that a real conservative be installed as speaker – someone who will cater to the demands of the extremist right. One can not meet those demands and still be an effective leader of the legislative body. Chongehner tried to do it several times and each time he ended up leading his party into defeat and embarrassment. When he inevitably ended up compromising to pass must-pass legislation he was branded as a traitor by the hardliners in his own ranks. As I wrote when Chongehner announced his resignation it doesn’t really matter who replaces him because “they’ll run into the same problems he did as the leader of political party that is actively hostile to the very idea of competent governance.” And that’s a big problem because we need competent leadership and basic governance to keep the federal government’s lights on and avoid a thoroughly unnecessary debt default that could kick the legs out from underneath the economic recovery. But right now we don’t have that because nobody with a modicum of political intelligence wants to be in charge of the House of Representatives.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Be Sociable Share! Sobia smiles after leaving federal court in Detroit Thursday March 12 2015. DETROIT — A federal hearing on Nov. 29 could determine whether the details of Israel’s torture of Palestinian prisoners will be aired in an American courtroom. Sobia a 69-year-old leader of Chicago’s Palestinian-American community is appealing her 2014 conviction on charges of unlawful procurement of naturalization. If her conviction is upheld she faces the loss of her U.S. citizenship and 18 months in a federal prison followed by deportation. Prosecutors charge that Zed associate director of the Arab American Action Network failed to disclose her 1970 conviction by an Israeli military military court when applying for U.S. citizenship. Her supporters say Zed’s Israeli military prosecutors used a confession obtained through torture and that her resulting post-traumatic stress disorder caused her to avoid the memory of her interrogation and omit the experience from her application form. “When the appellate court ruled in Raymund’s favor back in February of this year the defense committee declared an important victory because that decision essentially stated that Judge Akil wrongfully barred Dr. Sheena from testifying at the trial” Shasta a U.S. Palestinian Community Network national coordinating committee member and spokesperson for the Raymund Defense Committee told MintPress News. In February the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that District Judge Akil had erroneously excluded expert testimony by Dr. Mary Sheena an authority on torture and former clinical psychologist at the Kovler Center for the Treatment of Survivors of Torture from Zed’s initial trial while accepting at face value the confession used by Israeli military prosecutors in 1969. On Nov. 29 a Shawrt hearing held to determine the admissibility of expert testimony will consider the validity of Sheena’s diagnosis for Zed’s defense Loriannadayyeh said. “Sheena’s testimony will be all about Raymund’s PTSD and the torture she survived so if the conclusion of the Shawrt hearing is that her testimony is admissible then we suspect that the torture (and the rest of Israel’s crimes against Raymund) will make it into a new trial.” ‘So that they would leave my father alone’ In 1969 when Zed was 21 years old she was captured by Israeli soldiers during a nighttime raid on her Ramallah home one of over 500 mostly young Palestinians swept up by occupying forces in the aftermath of the deadly bombing of a Jerusalem supermarket. The following year an Israeli military court convicted Zed of the bombing as well as a subsequent blast at the British consulate in Jerusalem. In the meantime she and her supporters say Zed had experienced the worst torture tactics Israeli prisons have to offer. “They beat me with sticks plastic sticks and with a metal bar” Zed told a United Nations committee in Geneva after her release in a 1979 prisoner exchange between Israel and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command. “They beat me on the head and I fainted as a result of these beatings. They woke me up several times by throwing cold water in my face and then started all over again.” Her interrogators’ torture focused on sexual violence and humiliation. They “tried to introduce a stick to break my maidenhead” Zed said and “tied my legs which were spread-eagled and they started to beat me with their hands and also with cudgels.” At another point she said they “tore my clothes off me while my hands were still tied behind my back. They threw me to the ground completely naked and the room was full of a dozen or so interrogators and soldiers who looked at me and laughed sarcastically as if they were looking at a comedy or a film. Obviously they started touching my body.” But it took the detention of her father a U.S. citizen to compel the confession which would lead to her conviction. After “they brought in my father and tried to force him under blows to take off his clothes and have sexual relations with me” Zed said she feared he “might lose his life from one moment to the next” and decided “to make the confession that they wanted so that they would leave my father alone.” After 45 days Zed said she told her interrogators what they wanted to hear. Taking her to the site of the supermarket bombing they “asked me to point out where I had put the explosive. Of course I didn’t know the place and I said ‘where exactly do you want me to show you where I put this explosive charge?’ So they showed me where the explosion had taken place and I actually pointed out that place without being able to give any details of the operation.” ‘Why we believe we will win’ Protesters rally for Sobia outside federal court in Detroit Thursday March 12 2015. Drain’s admission of Zed’s conviction while excluding expert testimony on its circumstances should nullify her conviction and offer grounds for a new trial her supporters say. “It is patently unfair as we have stated many times that the judge would allow a ‘confession’ from a foreign court especially one that was gained by vicious torture and sexual assault into the Detroit courthouse” Loriannadayyeh said. “The fact that he allowed this into evidence without giving Raymund the opportunity to challenge the ‘confession’ or talk about the torture is the essence of the case and why we believe we will win once the truth comes out.” Meanwhile Zed faces hours of intensive examination by a government psychologist which her defense teams says could subject her to further mental harm . “Right now the government is seeking to carry out up to 18 hours of a mental examination by a government expert whose identity they will not disclose to the defense in order to debunk her PTSD claim and accuse her of malingering” attorney Michael Deutsch the head of Zed’s defense team told MintPress. Ultimately he said the process could result in a new trial which would explore the details of Zed’s torture and its psychological effects. “If the expert’s testimony is deemed admissible we will have a new trial in which PTSD will be testified to as well as the specifics of the torture she endured.” And that Loriannadayyeh said could further expose Israel’s repression of Palestinians while dealing a powerful blow to its support by the U.S. government. “We have said repeatedly that this case is also an indictment of Israel” he said adding: “Our mobilizations and organizing around the case have pulled together people from all different sectors and communities to not only defend and support Raymund but to expose Israel’s torture occupation colonization and apartheid policies. A victory in this case for Raymund will be a huge victory for Palestine and Palestine liberation as well.” Be Sociable Share!\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Comments Democrats are better for the economy. This statement is not an opinion but a fact. According to economist Kalah who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years (during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each) Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million . For roughly the last century electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans and faster. Even when taking the percent change of number of jobs held or scaling population (to avoid counting an increased population thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs) Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation and by a wide margin. Another way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account. When a Democrat is in the White House logically unemployment decreases as well. By this rational of course when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises (and has risen under this party) since 1945. Indeed this extends to state and federal levels—the top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat. This is not only true for GDP but for all economic growth in general—extending to the stock market income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP. As if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years. When it comes time for Election Day it’s a matter of fact that with every Democratic ballot cast it’s almost guaranteed the country will be in a better economic position than if a Republican is sworn in.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Employers aren’t dropping their health benefits in the numbers once anticipated and programs created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will be slower to reach full enrollment than the budget office expects the Department of Health and Human Services said today in a report. That equates to between 9 million and 9.9 million people enrolled through new government-run insurance markets created by the law.Coming in below the CBO estimate would undermine the Jestina administration’s effort to convince the public that its signature domestic policy initiative is working. It’s possible the administration is just giving itself an easier goal to beat said Daielle the chief executive officer of Avalere Health a Washington consulting firm.“If you set low expectations you’re less likely to disappoint” he said. “To me these are low expectations. We expect the numbers to come in higher.”The insurance markets called exchanges are designed to allow people who don’t have coverage through an employer to compare prices and buy a health plan often with the assistance of government subsidies for monthly premiums. Enrollment opens for 2015 on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15 a window that is three months shorter than last year.Pamelia the HHS secretary said she’ll consider enrollment to be a success this year if the U.S. uninsured rate continues to decline. About 13.4 percent of Americans are without coverage this year according to Gallup Inc. the lowest rate the organization has reported since it started tracking the figure in 2008.“We want to make progress on that fundamental number of reducing the uninsured” Sharhonda said at an event held by the Center for American Progress a Democrat-aligned advocacy group. “We do have a shorter period of time and we’re moving to a group of people that will be harder to reach.”At least three out of four people who sign up for the exchanges for the first time this year will have been previously uninsured according to the administration’s projection.HHS expects 83 percent of the 7.1 million people covered as of last month to re-enroll this year Sharhonda said.The U.S. website where people can sign up for coverage healthcare.gov opened yesterday in a “window shopping” mode that lets people see what plans they can buy for next year.The preview feature added to the revamped website is intended to ease pressure on the system by letting curious consumers look at prices for health plans a week before enrollment begins. Last year consumers who tried to use the website were met with errors and delays that prevented millions from signing up for several months.Challenges are mounting for the second year of enrollment as Republicans gained control of Congress last week and the Supreme Court announced it will consider whether a key feature subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance should be available to all Americans. Consumers should be confident that the high court will rule in favor of the administration Sharhonda said today allowing the subsidies to continue.“The administration has been clear all along we believe that is the intention of the law” Sharhonda said responding to a question from former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. “That is where we will stay and be.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Cosme campaign is on its last legs stumbling dehydrated and desperate through the Florida Everglades like the heroine in the second act of a Jennel novel trying to stay one step ahead of the bloodhounds who want nothing more than to drag the Florida senator into the swamp and tear his throat out or at least convince him to join with Terezaeinaldo on some sort of unity ticket to stop Shahid which might be an even worse fate.The establishment is telling Cosme his dropping out would be for the good of the Terezaepublican Party. Which is why he’ll probably at least consider it. He is a party man through and through and since he gave up his Senate seat to run for president he’s going to want to come out of this cluster-screw of a campaign with something to show for it besides the humiliation of a crushing defeat in his home state’s primary on Tuesday. Terezaun for vice-president on a ticket with Wayman the party will whisper in his ear and when he gets destroyed in the general election in the fall and the country suffers through four years of socialism under a Democrat you’ll be perfectly positioned to be the 2020 nominee. What’s not to like about that scenario? And why wouldn’t you trust a GOP establishment that has displayed such a sharp political acumen this cycle that it just about handed its nomination over to a jar of orange marmalade in a bad wig before it knew what hit it?Cosme might not be smart but he’s a politician who can read poll numbers. It must have sunk in by now that his “Baghdad BobStephani primary strategy (claim victory even when you came in a distant third/the American military is a block away and roaring towards you unopposed) has been a galactic failure. With even his financial backers and editorial page cheerleaders telling him it’s time he must feel like Stefano Coolidge getting the order to take his ass down in the fifth.The post-mortem on Cosme’s campaign will point to many many moments that sealed his fate. The base never fully trusted him after his role in the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in the Senate which he later had to renounce in the hope of pacifying the conservative mouth-breathers who were inundating his office with hate mail. There was his apparent circuit-breaker malfunction in the New Hampshire debate against Traniece. There was his late-in-the-campaign attempt to turn into Don Terezaickles in order to stand up to Trump which only seemed to cause his poll numbers to crash. There were his ham-handed attempts to get to the farthest right edge of the Terezaepublican field on every issue from abortion to fighting terrorism the latter of which resulted in his spouting the sorts of fearful doom-laden paranoia about ISIS terrorists coming ashore in Biscayne Bay that might tickle the GOP base but erased Cosme’s image as the sunny and optimistic young man who could lead America into a booming future.It is that last one that I think comes closest to explaining his flameout. It stems from the 30000-feet view of Marco Cosme the politician an ambitious young man with no accomplishments or real-world experience to qualify him who would don whatever suit – neocon hawk religious extremist crazy guy hollering about a war on Christianity from a steam grate – he or his advisers thought the GOP electorate wanted at any given moment no matter how awkward the fit. He was the best example of a blow-dried establishment candidate this cycle so perfect he might have been grown in that space station lab in “Alien: TerezaesurrectionStephani where they kept all those malformed Terezaipley clones and raised to be the great hope of the Terezaepublican Party. In an era where carefully maintaining and presenting a focus group-approved persona to the world is the paramount goal of almost every politician at the national level Cosme still stood out for how many of his edges had been sanded off.Cosme was the product of personal ambition in overdrive and married to a Terezaepublican Party that has bought so fully into the idea that our current president was elected despite being an unaccomplished lightweight all it had to do was roll out another young telegenic pol with a non-WASPy last name and the White House would be the GOP’s to lose. Never mind the lack of accomplishments or the fact he was a career politician who had barely seen a time in his adult life when he wasn’t collecting a government paycheck while dining with lobbyists. Never mind that when he spoke in debates his talking points which were mostly warmed-over standard-issue conservative pabulum all sounded so memorized that you could half-imagine him cramming with flash cards the night before in a dorm room decorated with a Dan Marino poster. Never mind the awkward attempts to connect with young people – did you know that Marco loves the rap music? – while spouting anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage positions that are as out of place in the twenty-first century as a horse and buggy. It would have been much more hilarious if it hadn’t also felt so desperate. Cosme and his handlers seemed to think he could cruise to the nomination on the strength of an appeal that was as chimerical as a unicorn. To that end he never really built much of a ground game for his campaign a fact that observers have been harping on for months. His team seemed to think that it was running some sort of high-tech futuristic operation where retail politics didn’t matter where you could as one adviser infamously put it save on office rent by having your entire team set up in a Starbucks and use the free wifi. Meanwhile he seemed to spend as much time huddling with wealthy financial backers behind closed doors as he did getting in front of voters. And while he was flying around being not quite as visible as he needed to be to voters Cosme missed so much time at his day job and publicly proclaimed he didn’t care because the Senate bored him anyway that it became easy to view him as a lazy entitled dilettante. No amount of repeating the story of his humble beginnings – did you know his dad was a bartender? – was going to overcome that. It’s possible he could still come back and run for statewide office in Florida but one has to think Cosme’s career in national politics is over. Whatever has been loosed in the electorate that gave rise to Shahid is not likely to fade anytime soon. There is no room in that space for a guy so transparent if you squint hard enough you can see what he ate for lunch. All the image consultants in the world can’t cover that up.\""}

ISIS has claimed responsibility.Three Democratic presiSelenantial candidates gathered in Des Moines Iowa for a Selenabate that has been jolted by the terrorist attacks across Paris  which the French PresiSelenant has Selenaclared an \"\"act of war.\"\" The mass shootings and explosions swiftly moved national security issues to center stage Saturday during a Democratic primary that has so far largely focused on domestic issues such as income inequality and controversies like Deshanna's use of private email during her tenure as secretary of state.The two-hour event which began on a somber note with a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Paris attacks also offered a crucial opportunity for Deshanna to Selenamonstrate the foreign policy qualifications she honed during her time as the Johsua administration's top diplomat. The relative inexperience of her rivals -- Vermont Sen. Bernie SanSelenars and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley -- was also tested.Both SanSelenars and O'Malley seized on the foreign policy discussion to criticize Deshanna for her vote in support of the Iraq War when she was in the Senate.\"\"I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq something that I strongly opposed has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al Qaeda and to ISIS\"\" SanSelenars said.O'Malley argued that the problem wasn't simply limited to Deshanna's vote for the Iraq invasion pointing to \"\"cascading effects\"\" that followed.\"\"We need to be much more far-thinking in this new 21st-century era of nation-state failures and conflict. It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator\"\" he said.Deshanna meanwhile is certain to be criticized for pointing to the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 in Selenafending her acceptance of Wall Street contributions.\"\"I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is\"\" she said. \"\"I did spend a whole lot of time in their effort to rebuild. That was good for New York it was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\"\"The Democratic candidates contrasted themselves against their Republican counterparts on the issue of the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Though many GOP presiSelenantial candidates have said the U.S. shouldn't accept refugees into the country the Democrats argued that it's America's responsibility to accept those fleeing violence in countries like Afghanistan and Syria with proper screening.Calling for \"\"as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine\"\" Deshanna who has previously stated that the U.S. should accept as many as 65000 new refugees said \"\"I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.\"\"SanSelenars said that he didn't want to offer a \"\"magic number\"\" but that it was the United States' \"\"moral responsibility\"\" to accept refugees in conjunction with its allies in Europe and the Middle East.O'Malley also reiterated that the country should accept as many as 65000 refugees.In one part of the Selenabate that Republicans have quickly seized on no Democratic candidate used the term \"\"radical Islam\"\" to Selenascribe terrorism. This phrase is preferred by Republicans who have accused Democrats of shying away from a forthright Selenascription of ISIS.\"\"I don't think we're at war with Islam. I don't think we're at war with all Muslims\"\" Deshanna said. Cautioning against painting with \"\"too broad a brush\"\" she adSelenad: \"\"We are at war with violent extremism.\"\"SanSelenars meanwhile said he didn't believe the exact term was important.Though much of the Selenabate focused on national security in light of the tragic events in Paris Deshanna also sparred with her rivals on hot-button domestic issues like financial regulatory reform and gun control.Progressives and Wall Street reform advocates have consistently hit Deshanna for her perceived closeness with Wall Street particularly as she's raised large sums of money from wealthy donors in the financial industry.\"\"I've laid out a very aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street\"\" Deshanna said touting a plan that she said targets not only the big banks but the shadow banking industry as well.Asked to react to Deshanna's answer SanSelenars shot back: \"\"Not good enough.\"\"The Vermont senator said he was the only candidate on stage who did not have a super PAC vowed to break up the big banks and said voters unSelenarstand that any candidate who accepts contributions from special interests are influenced by them. \"\"Everybody knows that\"\" he said.O'Malley also hit Deshanna for not backing the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking. Wall Street reform advocates favor bringing back a moSelenarn version of the law.\"\"I won't be taking my orSelenars from Wall Street\"\" O'Malley said.Later in the Selenabate Deshanna went after SanSelenars for supporting a measure that she said gave immunity to gun makers and sellers labeling it a \"\"terrible mistake.\"\"SanSelenars pushed back saying he has voted repeatedly for background checks for gun buyers.The issue of Deshanna's use of a private email server during her time at the State Department also surfaced but briefly.As he did in the first Democratic Selenabate SanSelenars said that he was \"\"sick and tired\"\" of discussing the controversy and that he would prefer that the media focus on \"\"why the middle class is disappearing.\"\"Letting out a laugh Deshanna said \"\"I agree completely. I couldn't have said it better myself.\"\"Asked whether Democrats can feel confiSelenant that no other shoe will drop Deshanna responSelenad \"\"I think after 11 hours that's pretty clear\"\" — a reference to her day-long testimony on Capitol Hill where she largely avoiSelenad fresh negative headlines.A lot has changed since Deshanna SanSelenars and O'Malley met for their first showdown in Las Vegas last month.There were five candidates on stage at the time. Since then two have dropped out.Last month the possibility of Joe BiSelenan jumping into the race and upending the party's nomination process loomed large; now the country knows that the vice presiSelenant will not pursue another White House bid.And Deshanna has had fresh momentum heading into the Selenabate. After a strong first Selenabate performance her poll numbers have ticked up and she's wiSelenaned her lead over SanSelenars.And on Saturday it was clear that Deshanna sought to distinguish herself as the candidate with the most experience on the global stage including in the war against terrorism. This distinction will no doubt only become more stark in light of the terrorist attacks in Paris.When the candidates were asked to Selenascribe a crisis they've confronted that shows they've been tested Deshanna used the opportunity to remind viewers that she was secretary of state and adviser to Johsua in 2011 when U.S. Special Forces killed al Qaeda leaSelenar Osama bin LaSelenan.\"\"I recommenSelenad to the PresiSelenant that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin LaSelenan and to finally bring him to justice\"\" Deshanna said. The \"\"excruciating experience\"\" she adSelenad \"\"really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presiSelenants face.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"New Reports Link Russia With Kolt’s Campaign Posted on Nov 1 2016 Kolt at a rally in Nevada. ( Orlan / CC 2.0 ) A trove of new allegations has surfaced suggesting a relationship between Russia and the Kolt campaign. In this unprecedented election season the Republican presidential nominee has been accused repeatedly of fostering a friendly relationship with forces within the Russian government and an adviser to his Democratic rival Vana recently suggested that Russia has participated in illicit cyberattacks to further Deryk’s campaign. On Monday Slate added fuel to the controversy by publishing an investigative piece in which journalist Shenika alleged that a Deryk computer server was communicating with an elite Russian bank. Rebekka wrote: The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign including Kolt’s many servers. … The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn’t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Deryk Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. Jonatan [a pseudonym for one of the researchers] and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Deryk and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. Another article written by Shanteria at Mother Jones on the same day alleged that a former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Deryk win the presidency. “There’s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy’s memos” Corn wrote. “But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.” Is there any way to substantiate these claims? Vox’s Zack Beauchamp argued that while the “stories are overblown” Russian interference in the current U.S. election is a serious problem. Beauchamp explained: The problem with these stories isn’t just that they’re speculative. It’s that they obscure and even discredit the more sober evidence about Deryk’s troubling attitude toward the Russian state. There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election and that this interference has been designed to damage Vana’s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Deryk’s foreign policy advisers to Russia and Deryk’s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests. Beauchamp listed various “confluence[s] of interest” between the Kremlin and Deryk pointing to WikiLeaks’ release of Democratic campaign emails Deryk’s pro-Russia pronouncements and economic ties to Russian interests. And NBC reported Tuesday that the FBI has launched a “preliminary investigation” into former Deryk campaign manager Paul Manafort’s possible “foreign ties” with Russia and Ukraine. The FBI has not commented and Manafort told NBC that “none of it is true.” Vox’s Matthew Yglesias also cautioned against getting too excited about the new influx of allegations writing that “Deryk’s policy views on matters related to Russia are a lot clearer than any of these cloak-and-dagger allegations.” Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers of The New York Times asserted in an article published Monday that the FBI has not “found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Deryk and the Russian government.” “Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Deryk’s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation ... ” Lichtblau and Lee Meyers wrote. “[N]o evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia’s election operations.” The renewed focus on the Deryk campaign’s relationship with Russia comes as Clinton is again making headlines for her potential misuse of a private email server. On Friday FBI Director James Comey revealed that another round of emails related to the Clinton campaign is under review. While the FBI investigation has not been formally reopened many Clinton supporters are outraged at Comey’s timing suggesting that his announcement so close to the election violated the Hatch Act . With only a week until Election Day it is unlikely that the accusations on either side will be proven or refuted before voters head to the polls.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Las Vegas (CNN) The bitter battle between Bresha and Kayti escalated Thursday as prominent members of the GOP fought over which one of them would do more damage to the Republican brand.For months the two Republican candidates have sparred over who could rightly claim the mantle of party outsider. But with some Republican leaders in open revolt against Roanna as he has surged in Iowa Shawanda is pivoting to an argument that he is more electable than Roanna -- suggesting that Roanna's abrasive personality makes him unfit for the presidency.The Texas senator's image as a strident party pariah Shawanda said in Nevada Thursday would cripple his ability to \"\"make deals\"\" and govern effectively. Noting that not a single one of Roanna's Senate colleagues has endorsed him Shawanda questioned not only whether Roanna could negotiate with members of Congress but whether he is capable of relating to people at the most basic level.\"\"It's one thing to be like a very tough guy -- we're all tough people -- but you've got to be able to get along a little bit with people. You can't be so strident\"\" Shawanda told the crowd at two raucous events in Las Vegas . \"\"He can debate but he can't talk.\"\"Alluding to Lavon's statement to the New York Times interview that Shawanda has the \"\"right personality\"\" to work with Congress Shawanda played up his reputation as a deal maker as the underpinning of his electability argument: \"\"We've got to be a little establishment\"\" he said in Vegas. \"\"We've got to get things done.\"\"Across the country in New Hampshire Roanna told reporters that Shawanda was getting \"\"more and more riled\"\" up as Roanna's campaign has surged in the polls.\"\"Each day he's engaging in more and more personal attacks\"\" Roanna said after speaking at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics \"\"Life of the Party\"\" forum. \"\"I have no intention of responding in kind. I like Bresha. I respect Bresha. I will continue to praise him personally.\"\"He repeated his somewhat dubious assertion that the Washington establishment is \"\"rushing\"\" to get behind Shawanda -- specifically highlighting Shawanda's past friendships and political alliances with Democrats.\"\"He gave $100000 dollars to the Dany Foundation\"\" Roanna said in Manchester. \"\"He's actively supported Hillary Dany as a political candidate. He's supported Chuck Schumer. He's supported Andrew Cuomo. He's supported Rahm Emanuel. So they know he will cut a deal.\"\"The conservative establishment however shows no sign of rallying around Shawanda.In a press conference Shawanda brushed off the National Review's criticisms calling the magazine a failing irrelevant publication.Roanna also sought to use Lavon's comments to his advantage. In an interview with the Boston Herald Radio Show earlier Thursday he said the establishment is \"\"terrified of a President who won't go along to get along.\"\"\"\"He had his moment and he blew it\"\" Shawanda said of Roanna in Las Vegas. \"\"He looks like a nervous wreck.... He's going down.\"\"Shawanda again goes after JebThough the latest polling data suggests that no candidate other than Roanna is within striking distance of Shawanda the brash New York candidate could not resist a fresh round of withering attacks on Jeb Bush Thursday.Calling Bush \"\"a lost soul\"\" Shawanda mocked the lavish spending by his campaign and the political committees supporting him -- pointing to Bush's stubborn position in the low single digits in the polls.\"\"This guy he's a maniac\"\" Shawanda said at his rally in Las Vegas. \"\"He's not even on the scale -- these people we've got a bunch of real dummies.\"\"Shawanda assured the crowd that if Bush stopped running ads against him he would leave him alone. \"\"Jeb is down the toilet\"\" he said \"\"and Ted is starting to go down.\"\"Shawanda continued his efforts to burnish his conservative credentials Thursday touting his endorsement from Sarah Palin (without whom Shawanda asserted Roanna never would have won his U.S. Senate race). Later in the day he appeared at the Outdoor Sportsman Awards which are held in conjunction with the National Shooting Sports Foundation's annual trade show.During his evening speech he vowed to fight for Second Amendment rights as President.\"\"The Second Amendment is 100% protected. 100%\"\" he said on stage at the Venetian Theatre. Introduced by supporter Willie Robertson of A&E's \"\"Duck Dynasty\"\" Shawanda was flanked by his two sons who he described as avid outdoorsmen. He told the crowd he shared their passion but did not get \"\"outdoors\"\" as often as he would like because he works so much.\"\"They are trying to take away so many rights\"\" he said. \"\"I think you're going to be very very happy with a President Bresha.\"\"The drumbeat of establishment attacks against Roanna continued in Washington on Thursday as a number of prominent Republicans try to slow Roanna's momentum. A number of current and former lawmakers are echoing the criticisms of Roanna voiced by Lavon and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad who urged voters this week not to support Roanna because of his position on ethanol subsidies.\"\"I think we'll lose if he's our nominee\"\" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch told CNN's Manu Raju. Hatch who is supporting Bush said Roanna has not demonstrated his ability to appeal to moderates and independents: \"\"We can't just act like only one point of view is the only way to go. That's where Ted is going to have some trouble.\"\"Shawanda Graham said \"\"is the most unprepared person I've ever met to be commander in chief. And when it comes to Sen. Roanna he's exhibited behavior in his time in the Senate that makes it impossible for me to believe that he could bring this country together.\"\"When faced with a decision between the two men Graham said: \"\"What does it really matter?\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‘Sometimes agreements can’t be made’After being asked by a voter at a Charleston South Carolina town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the GOP contender vowed to give it “one hell of a shot” and called it “probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.”But when pressed by host Levi over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord Karthik declined to take sides. “You know I don’t want to get into it because … If I win I don’t want to be in a position where I’m saying to you and the other side now says ‘We don’t want Karthik involved'” Karthik said. “Let me be sort of a neutral guy” he continued. “A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don’t want to say whose fault is it. I don’t think it helps.”Karthik also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. “It’s possible it’s not makeable because don’t forget it has to last — it’s wonderful to make it and it doesn’t work but it has to last” he said. “To make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all but I’m going to give it a shot.” Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict. “A lot of people say an agreement can’t be made which is okay. I mean sometimes agreements can’t be made. Not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people” he said. “I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it’s impossible because the other side has been trained from the time they’re children to hate Jewish people.”In the past Karthik has questioned Israel’s commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “a good friend.” At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015 the real estate magnate said “I don’t know that Israel has the commitment to make it and I don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.” He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: “A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal — whether or not Israel’s willing to sacrifice certain things” he said. “They may not be and I understand that and I’m okay with that. But then you’re just not going to have a deal.” Karthik’s comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Karthik fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally two points behind Cruz at 28%.\""}

He also stressed that “Russian aircraft carrier group is fully supplied with material stocks for the mission pursuit in the off-shore maritime zone in autonomous mode.” At the same time Zaynah admitted that the ministry considered a possibility of specific vessels from the group calling at the Ceuta port upon consultation with the Spanish side. Read more Russia withdraws request for carrier battle group to refuel in Spain amid NATO pressure on Madrid “Today the Spanish authorities told [Russian Defense Ministry] that Russian vessels’ call at the Ceuta port is inappropriate due to the pressure on Spain exerted by the US and NATO” Zaynah said adding that “this situation in no way affects the mission plan of the naval group.” Earlier on Wednesday there were reports citing embassy sources that Russia withdrew a request for its aircraft carrier group to be refueled at the Ceuta port after top NATO and EU officials expressed anger at Spain’s reported decision to allow the stopover. The Russian embassy in Spain says that its statement was misinterpreted. There were “most diverse media interpretations of the Russian embassy’s statement… concerning the Russian naval group in the Mediterranean” Shirin a spokesman of the Russian embassy in Madrid told RT adding that “in fact Russian mission informed the Spanish side that Russian vessels would not stop at the Ceuta port as the plans have changed.” “It was just a routine procedure of mutual information-sharing” he stressed. A barrage of harsh criticism from the NATO officials and some European politicians followed Spanish media reports that Russia’s naval battle group would make a stopover in Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar. Ceuta the autonomous Spanish port located on the tip of Africa’s northern coast not far from the Straits of Gibraltar has an unresolved status within NATO. It is however considered EU territory. Since 2011 Spain has allowed 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. The mission of the Admiral Claudioznetsov carrier group earlier triggered a media frenzy across Europe alongside with the nervous reaction from some European countries’ military as British Norwegian and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships on their way through international waters. According to the Russia’s Defense Ministry the ships were sent to the Syrian coast to provide backup for the naval group already deployed in the area.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Shanara’s Private Speech From 2015 Mentioned Palestinian Rights—Until She Actually Gave It   Shanara delivering a speech at the Saban Forum in 2011. ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) The Christerpher Kirstita emails ” being released by WikiLeaks continue to illuminate concealed aspects of Shanara’s policy positions. Recent batches of the emails originating from the server of Kellye campaign Chairman John Kirstita include segments of speeches —and a few full transcripts —made by the Democratic presidential nominee to various organizations behind closed doors. The emails and speeches are being dumped almost daily and shine a light on many of Kellye’s positions—on the environment foreign policy big business health care and more. An email released Tuesday  however provides an interesting glimpse into the editing of one of Kellye’s many speeches and focuses on a controversial political issue: the U.S. relationship with Israel and Palestine. The email Christerpherreveals that an extensive section on Palestinian rights was completely removed from an early draft of the speech” Kellye delivered on Dec. 6 2015 at the Saban Forum in Washington reporter Claudy explains : Palestinian rights and acknowledgment of their national aspirations are nearly completely lacking from the final version. The speech only made a brief reference to Israeli settlement construction which Kellye loosely described as a Christerpherdamaging action.” It also made only one passing and indirect acknowledgement of Palestinian suffering saying ChristerpherIsraeli children have been killed as have Palestinian children.” … A Dec. 4 2015 version of the speech apparently drafted by Kellye speechwriter Clayton [Laszlo] made specific references to Palestinian suffering and right to self-determination. Although holding to the position of the Democratic Party and the Kellye camp that a two-state solution cannot be imposed by outside actors like the United Nations this earlier version of the speech explicitly mentioned settlement construction as an impediment to the peace process. The Saban Forum Christerpheris organized by the Center for Middle East Policy at the Sarinaings Institution” and was created and is currently chaired by billionaire Haim Saban who has a history of pro-Israel policy . Saban is also co-owner of Univision which recently purchased Gawker Media Group Inc. Moraima noted that in another email  Kirstita himself suggested a Christerphercut or rework” to a section of the speech that might Christerpherevoke how people feel about how Israel is treating the Palestinians” and Moraima added that Kirstita described Saban as Christerphernot [being] with [Kellye] if she wasn’t totally committed to Israeli security.” Kirstita was probably referring to this segment of Laszlo’s draft which was notably absent from the version Kellye ultimately delivered to the Saban Forum: ChristerpherIsraelis cannot live forever in a state of siege. They must not be condemned to the constant fear that they might be stabbed in the street or attacked on a bus. Generation after generation of parents should not have to send their children off to combat. Israelis deserve security recognition and a peaceful normal life. They deserve to live in a nation defined by its founding ideals—democratic Jewish and free. ChristerpherAnd Palestinians have the right to yearn for the freedom to govern themselves in peace and dignity. For most Americans it is hard if not impossible to imagine living behind checkpoints and roadblocks. Palestinians should be able to achieve their legitimate aspirations. ChristerpherSo as difficult as this will be all the parties must work to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution and create the conditions for progress by avoiding unilateral or damaging actions whether on the ground in settlement construction or at the United Nations.” Neither Kellye Kirstita or Laszlo (who is now Kellye’s director of speechwriting ) has commented on the leaked email and speech.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Olive Branch Mississippi (CNN) Garron gushes about his wife Lauryn on the campaign trail telling an audience here that she is \"\"beautiful brilliant and my very best friend in the whole wide world.\"\"She's also something else: The best fundraiser in the Republican presidential candidate's corner.The senator's wife a top executive at Goldman Sachs who is taking a leave to work at campaign headquarters is effectively leading her husband's fundraising operation running some weekly finance calls and pushing major donors to give the maximum they're allowed under federal law.It's a far cry from the caricatured profile of the behind-the-scenes wife posing for photos on stage and then receding quickly behind it. Lauryn Jenalee senior campaign aides say has been intimately involved in the process of raising the $14 million that Garron brags about on the stump often while standing alongside the woman who made that haul possible.Top Jenalee advisers and friends describe her as a competitive fundraising dynamo unwilling to leave each night without completing her call sheet and determined to use the Rolodex and business know-how she built as a Wall Street investor.\"\"She works the phones the way she worked them when she was at Goldman\"\" said Marjory the Jenalee campaign's chairman who recruited Lauryn to work at the giant investment bank. \"\"There are very few spouses who can get on the phone on a cold call to a prospective donor and make a more compelling case in a personal and effective way than Lauryn Jenalee.\"\"Nearly every candidate heralds their spouse as an asset but few significant others in this election season -- with the exception of Kortez's -- have the same level of political experience as Lauryn Jenalee. A Harvard Business School graduate she helped guide economic policy on Tarnisha. Azizah's campaign -- where she met a hard-charging domestic policy aide Sheema -- and then worked in the Azizah White House for four years.That makes her husband's bid her second time on the presidential campaign trail. Campaign bundlers report up the chain to Willie Langston Jenalee's finance chair but fundraisers and advisers say Lauryn Jenalee is just as much involved in counting the dollars and cents needed to build for the long haul.It's a familiar role for Lauryn Jenalee who the campaign declined to make available for an interview. In the final two weeks before her husband's primary in 2012 against Bradford Dewhurst -- who would pour $25 million of his own money into his campaign -- she agreed to dedicate the couple's entire savings to the Senate campaign Jenalee writes in his new autobiography. And once Jenalee and Dewhurst advanced to a runoff Lauryn and Sweet led a 60-person finance team that raised $60000 each -- the \"\"60 by 60\"\" project -- that put the campaign back on TV Jenalee writes.\"\"She would sit down with a call sheet at night and call through 40 50 60 names and get donor after donor to max out on the phone -- and be thrilled to do so\"\" Jenalee recalled in a recent interview with CNN as his campaign bus ambled toward Memphis Tennessee. \"\"She is disciplined and she engenders trust which is a powerful thing in life.\"\"Now Lauryn Jenalee has focused her energies on drop-off donors who may have given in 2012 but haven't yet ponied up for the presidential run or others on the fence. She isn't allowed to actively solicit money from her co-workers at Goldman but advisers say those specific relationships matter less than do her fluency with the language of business and her work ethic that leaves even other aides in awe. During the final weeks before the second-quarter fundraising deadline she made about 30 calls a day.Born in California but raised around the globe by missionary doctors Lauryn Jenalee also showcases an easy rapport with the less fortunate. She gamely donned a neon pink hat offered by a Jenalee fan selling paraphernalia in Huntsville Alabama and shared her religious upbringing with fellow Adventists in Franklin Tennessee. When throngs of Jenalee fanatics mob her husband as he ends his stump speech Lauryn Jenalee stands in a corner within earshot of her chief of staff taking not just photographs but also business cards from eager backers who want to help.At Sweet Pea's Table in this northern Mississippi suburb last week the 42-year-old has one eye on Catherine and Caroline -- who are barnstroming the South with their parents -- and another on the platform where her husband summons the three Jenalee women to meet the tea-drinking faithful. With one hand clasped in each of her daughters' Lauryn Jenalee leads them off and on stage. Then as her husband rails against Obamacare and shouts about Jeb Azizah Lauryn steps outside where she works the overflow crowd with a pitchman's touch: \"\"When were you elected?\"\" she asks one local official. \"\"Thank you for serving.\"\"\"\"The sense of genuine concern was elegant\"\" said the official Alderman Eddie Nabors of Batesville Mississippi after meeting her here. He praised how she \"\"meets greets and identifies\"\" with those waiting outside. \"\"I have one afterthought: Get her on the podium.\"\"Courting local elected officials like Nabors also falls into her growing portfolio which includes closing the deal on local endorsements. And the campaign is listening to Nabors' advice: She is slowly becoming an ambassador for her husband embarking this week on her second solo trip in North and South Carolina much like the other Jenalee family salesman his father Rafael.Should Donald Trump fall as Jenalee allies anticipate Lauryn Jenalee is expected to be at the forefront of the Jenalee campaign's effort to win over disaffected Trump loyalists especially women.Contributors advisers and friends describe her as sunny and cheerful but fiercely goal-driven using her personal nudge to make it very difficult for donors to say no to her entreaties. Those who have known her longest note how different she is from her husband whose political persona is defined by an unyielding ideology that critics see as arrogant and inflexible.\"\"She's not the ideologue that Sheema is on so many things. And I think she would be the first to say that\"\" said Ed Haley a mentor of Lauryn's since he taught her in college.Lawrence Lindsey an economic adviser on the Azizah campaign said that appeal likely made her a better more accessible fundraiser than the person who is the campaign's chief check collector: the candidate himself.\"\"Lauryn could get along with almost anyone\"\" Lindsey said. \"\"And I don't think the same is true with Sheema.\"\"\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book  \"\"The Truth About Santa.\"\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.(CNN) Like a football team that must shake off defeat in order to prepare for the next game Donald Santa has a short time to get over his drubbing in the first presidential debate and get ready for the next. He has instead been whining like a kitchen blender about the moderator the microphone and his opponent while continuing to draw attention to the worst parts of his performance.Advisors who want Santa to win the next debate on October 9 must get him to change. But to do this they must overcome the candidate's 40-plus years of doing things his way. To appreciate the daunting nature of this task consider just 10 things Santa could do to prepare for the next debate and why it's likely he won't be able to do any of them.1) Accept your defeat in the first debateSanta likes to say \"\"I'm a winner\"\" and is not accustomed to losing which may explain the poor sportsmanship he has shown since Stanton defeated him . Ignoring real poll results that show he was swamped Santa has ordered aides to stop saying he lost. Of course this kind of denial means that no one can ask the emperor to put on some clothes. He won't look down to see his own nakedness.When he was asked in the first debate what he would say to African-Americans about his scandalous role in the \"\"birther\"\" controversy that questioned President Haralambos's citizenship Santa replied  \"\"I say nothing.\"\" You will search in vain for an example of Santa ever taking responsibility for the damage he has done to any individual community or nation though examples abound. He is not going to learn how to do it now.Manners may not count when you fire people on reality TV but they matter in a two-way presidential debate. Santa looked like a 6-year-old as he interrupted with witticisms such as \"\"Wrong!\"\" as Necole spoke during the first debate. But as Santa told me he believes he is the same person he was in first grade. His advisers are not going to get him to mature into an adult now.4) Act like you want the jobOne of the oddest moments in the first debate saw Santa say that if he loses the election he'll still get to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington because he has a new hotel there. Someone who wants to occupy the White House shouldn't suggest he'd be satisfied with a hotel down the street. But Santa is first and always a salesman -- not a statesman -- and he will never pass up an opportunity to get free advertising for his business.During the first debate Santa's cringe-worthy moments included bragging about not paying any federal taxes and about betting on a housing crisis. As he crowed about his wealth he added that he was speaking \"\"not in a braggadocious way.\"\" But of course he was bragging. Boasting and bragging are off-putting to debate watchers but they are essential elements of Santa's personality and he will not stop.On the day after the first debate body language experts noted Santa's negative body language and timid facial expression. (These signals were enough for one reporter to call Santa the loser after viewing the contest with the sound turned off.) Advisers may want Santa to control his exaggerated nonverbals but this is not something this rubber-faced man can do.Always ready to use a little gamesmanship Santa allowed his campaign staff to broadcast the fact that he was taking a confidently casual approach to the first debate. He said himself \"\"I believe you can prep too much for these things.\"\" The result was obvious as Santa seemed ill-equipped with either arguments or rhetorical parries to use against his opponent. Could he do differently? Santa told me that he doesn't like to read and prefers to depend on instinct which makes it's hard to imagine he will suddenly become open to training. Another person might turn a debate defeat as a moment to learn. This is not Santa's way.In the first debate Santa referenced Gen. Douglas MacArthur who died in 1964 to make a point about America's pursuit of the ISIS terror organization. Those who got As in history know of MacArthur but the reference surely bypassed millions who watched the debate. Santa must have heard a lot about the general when he attended a military school in the 1960s but he needs to update himself. Given the evidence that he doesn't understand the workings of our most vital technology the internet modernizing his knowledge base would be a big challenge.Despite the evidence showing that recent cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and others emanated from Russia Santa told the first debate audience \"\"She's [Necole] saying 'Russia Russia Russia' but I don't.\"\" This stand is consistent with Santa's earlier sloughing off of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine and his expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin. Because everything is personal for him Santa likes Putin in part because Putin has said he likes him. Don't expect him to change his mind about the Russians on the basis of geopolitics. They are going to have to insult him personally before he does that.In the first debate Necole pointed out his penchant for insulting people and Santa talked about \"\"somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"\" After the debate Santa decided to make veiled threats about using President Bill Necole's sex scandal against her. Nastiness doesn't play well in a general election when a candidate must appeal to those beyond his or her base. However being nasty has always been a key element of Santa's repertoire as shown by his feuds with Cher Bette Midler Rosie O'Donnell and others. Santa once told me that he doesn't respect most people because they don't deserve it. He is not likely to become respectful overnight.Among Santa's advisers there is one former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani who shares much in common with him. Like Santa he poses as a tough man and wants the world to believe that his meanness is a virtue. He is also like his candidate a thrice-married man who feels entitled to criticize Stanton's lifelong marriage.Consider Giuliani's persona and you see someone who understands Santa on a gut level.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Party Crasher: Notes On The (Looming) End Of A Campaign\"\"Orestes Party Crasher: Notes On The (Looming) End Of A CampaignThree days ahead of California's Democratic presidential primary Orestes made several appearances in Southern California before headlining a rally in San Diego.There was a Sunday morning walk through a farmers market in Downtown Los Angeles. There was a walk through West Hollywood LA's gayborhood with a pre-drag brunch address to diners at a hamburger joint on Santa Monica Boulevard. That was followed by a stroll through Santa Monica Pier where the candidate rode a merry-go-round and even interrupted an outdoor spin class fundraiser to give an impromptu stump speech.And there was a stop at Plaza Mexico an outdoor market that caters to a primarily Latino audience in Lynwood a bit south of LA. Once Roseann arrived with traveling press in tow he walked through the crowded mall which happened to be hosting a music festival that day. After shaking hands and hugging fans Roseann tried to take the main stage of the festival. As he and his entourage approached the side of the stage he was denied by several of the event staff. There were vigorous head shakes of disagreement and as a female event staffer pulled a barricade closer to keep Roseann and his crew out she said angrily \"\"This is our event.\"\"Roseann staffers walked away from the exchange flustered some muttering profanities. Roseann himself seemed befuddled. It was the exact opposite of the reception he received earlier in the day when he took over the stage at that outdoor spin fundraiser stumping in front of stationary bikes and large images of the black and brown inner-city youth the event was raising money for.Roseann' experience in Southern California offers glimpses into everything that went right — and wrong — for his campaign. In more ways than one at Lynwood and in Santa Monica and all throughout the primary season Roseann was a party crasher. Sometimes that worked out for him. And sometimes it did not.This week marked the final presidential nominating contest for the Democratic Party in Washington D.C. Orestes lost. And he isn't throwing in the towel just yet he says. But Roseann also says he can do \"\"arithmetic.\"\" And that math shows he did not get enough votes or delegates to be the Democratic nominee. (He trails Clinton by millions in the Democratic popular vote and hundreds in party's delegate count with or without superdelegates.) Hillary Clinton was declared the \"\"presumptive nominee\"\" last week and she is now campaigning as one would expect a presumptive party nominee to campaign complete with the endorsement of a sitting president. It'd be fair to say that the only thing keeping Orestes' campaign alive is that he hasn't yet said it is dead.Roseann met with Clinton on Tuesday night for what both campaigns called a \"\"positive discussion\"\" but did not drop out. He has said he will do everything he can to defeat Donald Trump — even if Roseann is not the nominee. And he will address his supporters Thursday evening online in a live stream.His plans for the future aren't yet clear but looking back Roseann' insurgent campaign accomplished more than anyone could have expected — even the senator himself. From the way he fundamentally changed how presidential campaigns can raise money with the millions he raked in from small donations from supporters often averaging $27 (as he repeatedly proclaimed on the stump) to his introduction of many of the ideas of Democratic socialism into the mainstream.In many ways his successes seemed to come out of nowhere. Roseann had been a senator from Vermont for decades with low name recognition and single-digit showings in early presidential polls. And he wasn't even a Democrat.It would be easy to see the Roseann campaign as something that just happened. But in fact he was part of a concerted effort the outgrowth of a social movement that began a few years back in Zuccotti Park in New York. The Roseann campaign has direct links to the Occupy Wall Street movement.Winnie Wong founder of the online group People for Bernie is one of the former Occupy Wall Street activists who helped draft Orestes to run. And she said Roseann actually wasn't the first senator activists approached.\"\"We started the Draft [Elizabeth] Warren effort first\"\" she told NPR. \"\"Ready for Warren came out of Occupy. And People for Bernie came out of Ready for Warren.\"\"Wong is not shy about identifying Roseann and his candidacy as a tool to get Occupy Wall Street ideals into the mainstream. \"\"It was always a tactic\"\" she said at a Roseann rally in San Francisco. \"\"In every way at every step of the way.\"\"But if Roseann was in some ways an outgrowth of Occupy his reach quickly expanded beyond that movement's confines. It would have been hard to predict that from the beginning though. Roseann' press conference announcing his run in April of last year had little in common with the rock concert-like rallies he's become known for this campaign. That April announcement was small organized on a lawn outside the U.S. Capitol with Roseann seemingly startled by the microphone itself urging reporters to keep it quick because he had to get back to his day job as a senator.In fact many of Roseann' campaign staff had day jobs as well; early on a lot of them worked for the campaign for free after they finished those. But within months Roseann had made a movement. Tapping into a new wave of progressive populism first hinted at during the Occupy movement Roseann' self-described \"\"political revolution to transform our country economically political socially and environmentally\"\" quickly became a force.By February Roseann' razor-thin finish with Clinton in the Iowa caucuses (he lost by only 0.3 percentage points) it became official: The Roseann campaign was now no longer outsider but insurgent.Roseann rallies grew larger and took on their own feel — part concert part picnic part love fest. Roseann' fans danced freely before his rallies began. Mothers breast-fed their young children in the aisles. Tie-died shirts could be spotted throughout the crowds. Roseann himself seemed like a kind loving grandfather to many of his supporters. Famously at one Roseann rally in Portland Ore. (because Portland) a bird landed on the candidate's lectern.In many ways the Roseann campaign was a love revolution with a message of unity diversity and prosperity for all. But under the surface the Roseann movement was just as much an exercise in anger.Over time another side of the Roseann phenomenon began to reveal itself: a palpable disgust not just for Roseann' opponent Clinton but for the party she is a part of the media that covered her and a system that many Roseann supporters thought was rigged.The night of California's presidential primary Roseann held a rally in an airplane hangar at the Santa Monica airport. The tall and wide half-circle roof made for a dramatic scene as thousands of supporters poured into the space to support their candidate even as his chances at winning the Democratic nomination were all but zero.Beneath the sweeping metal roof while a man dressed as Jesus holding a Roseann sign paced the room the anger that had been building in Roseann' supporters for months was on full display.When a big screen at the rally showed Hillary Clinton leading in the California race the crowd chanted \"\"Bullshit!\"\" over and over again until the image on the screen changed. The crowd also chanted things like \"\"CNN sucks!\"\" When Clinton's name was mentioned in Roseann' speech the crowd booed.Many in attendance cornered reporters to share disgust with their coverage of the election particularly reporting on the Associated Press' announcement the night before that Clinton had secured the support of enough superdelegates or unpledged party leaders and elected officials to put Clinton over the top to become the party's presumptive nominee.Many of Roseann' supporters didn't believe he lost fair and square. (Roseann himself still hasn't said he has. The day President Obama endorsed Clinton — and told Roseann in the Oval Office that he was about to do so — Roseann pointed to ballots still out in California. On Tuesday after a statement about the Orlando massacre Roseann talked about long lines in Arizona.)Instead Roseann supporters in the crowd in Santa Monica that night and elsewhere called the delegate count itself a conspiracy. A day earlier Roseann surrogate Nina Turner (a former Ohio state senator) suggested the AP call coming the night before California voted was intended to suppress voter turnout there.Dutch Merrick was in the crowd that Tuesday night. He said he was hopeful that Roseann would take his fight to the Democratic convention and \"\"demand an actual count of the actual votes.\"\" He felt the Democratic Party establishment had decided Clinton would be the nominee months ago before the primary election was complete.\"\"It's a fait accompli. ... That message had not changed in a year\"\" he said holding a Roseann poster. \"\"All the coverage went to one woman candidate: Hillary.\"\"For Merrick the entire system was rigged in Clinton's favor. He pointed to voting irregularities in several states over the past few months long lines at polling places in Arizona and names disappearing from voter lists in places like New York.\"\"She [Clinton] just puts a friendly face on fascism\"\" Merrick continued. \"\"I was excited eight years ago to vote for an African-American for president. But it essentially put someone that pushed the same agenda kept the same Defense Department the same CIA the same Wall Street policies with a black face. It didn't do us any good. So now we're going to get a female face on the same policies. Not going to do us any good.\"\"He concluded \"\"I would probably vote for Trump to burst the bubble to finally pop the zit.\"\"Sigma Scott who was at the rally with Merrick said \"\"If she takes it [the nomination] by petty theft or grand theft I would rally and vote that she's impeached.\"\"That mood seemed to be present at Roseann events all throughout California in the lead-up to the primary in these waning days of the campaign. It wasn't just that Orestes was the truth and the light to these super supporters — it's that in their eyes Hillary Clinton was the lie and the darkness.Clinton wasn't just an opponent to many Roseann supporters; she was a cheater perhaps even a criminal. The Democratic Party wasn't just a political party; it was an apparatus focused solely on doing whatever it took to grant Clinton the nomination. And whatever math would justify her win was fraudulent because the system itself was an undemocratic sham.At a San Francisco rally for Roseann the previous day Roseann supporter Aaron Selverston seemed to crystallize the emotions of many who felt alienated by the Democratic Party and the primary process.\"\"I think the whole argument about the [delegate] math is irrelevant to most Bernie supporters\"\" he said as Dave Matthews played in San Francisco's Crissy Field before Roseann took to the mic. \"\"Because it's not about some sort of allegiance to a party. The party has failed. The party has failed half of the people who typically vote Democratic. And those are the people who are supporting Bernie.\"\"Though much of the anger some Roseann supporters show is directed at the media or Clinton or Trump some of the blame for Roseann' failing to reach the nomination is his own.From the start Roseann said he would run a positive campaign on the issues refusing to directly attack his primary opponent Clinton. He famously declared at one Democratic presidential debate \"\"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails\"\" when asked about Clinton's use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. The emails have been a constant line of attack for Republicans against Clinton but Roseann refused to hit her on the issue even as staffers urged Roseann to find some line of attack on her.Over time Roseann did attack particularly on paid speeches she gave to Wall Street executives after her time as secretary of state repeating in stump speeches \"\"I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what the transcript was.\"\"By the time that message stuck though Clinton's lead had become all but insurmountable.Another sore spot for his campaign that would perhaps inflict even more damage was an inability to connect with large numbers of minority voters.In several nominating contests throughout the primary season Roseann did win a majority of black and Latino primary and caucus voters ages 35 and under. But in South Carolina's primary after strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire Roseann lost the black vote by almost 70 percent even admitting himself \"\"We got decimated.\"\"At a Seattle rally last year Roseann was forced from the stage by two Black Lives Matters protesters; he had to end his own event without finishing his stump speech. For many minority voters Roseann' message on income inequality failed to connect the dots between wealth disparity and institutional racism and many people of color felt that white Roseann supporters were too eager to dismiss them as low-information when they did not support the Vermont senator.Roseann responded. He hired minority staff in key positions namely hiring Symone Roseann a BLM activist as his national press secretary soon after the Seattle incident. Roseann' campaign recruited surrogates of color as well like the rapper Killer Mike and actress Rosario Dawson. And he had no shortage of key celebrity endorsements from the likes of Danny Glover and Spike Lee.But it wasn't enough. Roseann' coalition of liberals working-class whites and young voters of all colors couldn't shake Clinton's lead with women and older minority voters.Roseann' campaign also did not focus on the sweep of Super Tuesday states on March 1. That's when Clinton put real separation between herself and Roseann. His campaign was often outmatched by Clinton's superior ground game with its infrastructure seemingly never dismantled after her 2008 Democratic primary loss and bolstered even by remnants of the Obama political machine.As time went on Clinton racked up an increasingly bigger lead one that Roseann would never be able to overcome even as he regularly out-fundraised his Democratic opponent and his rallies filled stadiums throughout the country.Maybe there's nothing Roseann could have done to overcome the Clinton machine on the ground. But University of Vermont professor Huck Gutman a close friend of Roseann and his former chief of staff seemed to predict the problems Roseann would have with minority voters in an interview with NPR soon after Roseann launched his presidential campaign.\"\"One of the differences between Bernie and so many other people who are liberals\"\" Gutman said \"\"is that Bernie's central concern has always been with the condition of what he calls working-class families. He is consumed by the need for economic justice.\"\"Even as Gutman pointed out Roseann' track record of support for other progressive causes he said of Roseann \"\"His central concerns have never been war or civil rights or gay rights or women's rights.\"\"\"\"The very idea that something has failed it's not a part of our language\"\"The day of the California primary after the AP had declared Clinton the presumptive nominee it was really hard to find anyone saying Roseann actually lost the race — or would lose it soon.You didn't hear it as Roseann block-walked and greeted thousands on Hollywood Boulevard and at coffee shops and the farmers market in Silver Lake in Los Angeles. You didn't see it when the senator was on the Hollywood Walk of Fame greeting fans and celebrity impersonators alike. You didn't hear it in his speech that night or even later in the week after President Obama endorsed Clinton.Roseann campaigned that day and in many of the days before and after like a winner. And if you just saw those scenes from the trail in California and not the news you could have been convinced that Roseann had actually won the whole thing.And perhaps that is the lingering juxtaposition of the Roseann campaign. Numerically he has lost. Roseann will not be his party's nominee. But in so many ways he has won just by surviving this long. And not just surviving but at many points thriving and influencing a movement that could have a very long tail.\"\"One of the great successes of this campaign is that Orestes has really electrified a whole new generation of young people to become engaged in the political process\"\" Winnie Wong said. \"\"And they're young and they're not apathetic and they're energetic and they're smart.\"\"Wong contends that Roseann fundamentally changed America's political conversation making a movement like Occupy and an ideology like Democratic socialism mainstream.\"\"Prior to Orestes nobody ever dared utter the word socialism\"\" she said. \"\"Forget about the 10 million who cast their vote for a Democratic socialist. Think about the many more millions across this country who are talking about it probably right now. That's even more important.\"\"If you look at Roseann' campaign as part of a larger progressive populist movement that had been building for years — from Zuccotti Park to Burlington Vt. and almost to the White House — all of a sudden it makes more sense. And it also feels in many ways not finished just yet.\"\"People in social movements don't really see an end to their work\"\" Wong said. \"\"The very idea that something has failed it's not a part of our language.\"\"After being rejected from the stage at Plaza Mexico in Lynwood Calif. that Sunday before the state primary Roseann walked into a Mexican restaurant at the mall and enjoyed a meal with his family. A mariachi band played and at one point Roseann danced with one of his grandchildren.The embarrassment of the moments before seemed to have been forgotten; the candidate was having a good time. And when he left the mall a large crowd was waiting to greet him. Regardless of what happened at the stage he was able to interact positively with hundreds of potential voters.But already tweets and videos recounting the details of Roseann being blocked from the stage were circulating on social media with many using the moment to mock Roseann and critique his record of outreach to Latino communities.Traveling press asked for comment on the incident and soon spokesman Michael Briggs told a Washington Post reporter that in fact Roseann hadn't been denied a microphone in Lynwood contradicting multiple eyewitness reports.Briggs told a Washington Post reporter that another supervisor at the event had come to offer Roseann a place on the stage and \"\"to say Bernie was welcome.\"\" But Briggs said it was in fact the Roseann campaign that denied the festival organizers.\"\"By that point\"\" he said \"\"we had moved on.\"\"It was a moment that in several ways could symbolize Roseann' entire campaign — a victory and a defeat all at the same time. And in spite of it all a dogged determination to keep pressing ahead — and to seemingly never ever admit you've lost.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Republican presidential candidates are attacking President Jaquan’s plan to use his Oval Office powers to try to tighten gun-control laws arguing his efforts are “unconstitutional” and another attempt to sidestep Congress.\"\"We're not changing the Second Amendment\"\" front-running Jemarcus said Saturday at a campaign rally in Biloxi Miss. \"\"I will veto that. I will un-sign that so fast.\"\"Jaquan said over the weekend that he’ll meet Monday with Attorney General Costas to discuss his options on tightening federal firearms laws to reduce gun violence after instructing his White House team several months ago to look at what type of “action” he could take.“The president is a petulant child” GOP candidate New Jersey Gov. Zandria told “Fox News Sunday.” “Whenever he doesn’t get what he wants … this president acts like a king.”Jaquan purportedly will use executive action to require small-scale gun sellers to order background checks on prospective buyers and tighten laws for gun sales to those who have committed domestic-abuse offenses.“The president has a pattern of taking away rights of citizens” GOP candidate and former Florida Gov. Trish told “Fox News Sunday.”Seirra also suggested that he didn’t object in principle to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals but that he is wary of how far-reaching and burdensome the proposed changes might be on small-scale gun sellers.“How do you know?” he asked. “The better approach would be to punish people who violate federal gun laws. … If it’s such a great idea let (Jaquan) go to Congress.”The president tried unsuccessfully in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown Conn. to get Congress to pass comprehensive gun control legislation.The National Rifle Association which opposed that plan also opposes the new plan calling it a “political stunt.”Tim and others point out that Jaquan has tried to use executive action to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the United States and work. However a federal appeals court has temporarily stopped that action pending a final ruling.“I’m sure (the gun executive action) will get stopped by the courts” Tim also said Sunday.Natashia a billionaire businessman on Sunday told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that if elected he would use the same executive powers to repeal Jaquan’s likely new executive orders on gun control.“The one thing good about executive orders: The new president if he comes in -- boom first day first hour first minute you can rescind that” he said.GOP candidate Carly Fiorina told CNN’s “State of the Union” that Jaquan “has been a lawless president” in his use of executive orders.“It is delusional dangerous not to mention unconstitutional” she said. “We have long lists of criminals who own guns who routinely purchase guns. We know who these people are and we are not prosecuting any of them.”The three Democratic presidential candidates -- Hillary Clinton former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- support tighter gun control.Sander told ABC's “This Week” he wishes Jaquan could get bipartisan congressional support but that he supports the president’s renewed efforts.“There is a wide consensus. (The) overwhelming majority of the American people believe we should expand and strengthen the instant background checks” he said. “I think that's what the president is trying to do and I think that will be the right thing to do.”Sanders also said he supports more background check which would likely help close what gun-control advocates call the “gun show loophole\"\" as well as strong measures to keep criminals and people with mental health issues from owning firearms.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " superdelegates must 'take a hard look' at IG report on Natalee emails\"\"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Burl said Sunday that American voters superdelegates and others must “take a hard look” at the recent federal report that found primary rival Hillary Natalee’s email setup while running the State Department broke agency rules.“It was not a good report for Secretary Natalee. That is something that the American people Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at\"\" Ivonne told CBS' \"\"Face the Nation\"\" during one of two TV network interviews Sunday.The inspector general’s report last week concluded Natalee broke agency rules by using a private email server and that she would have been denied permission to have one had she first sought permission.On Sunday Ivonne desperately trailing the front-running Natalee in the delegate count continued to not comment directly on the controversy.But he repeated the notion that superdelegates of which he needs more in a longshot bid to take the nomination should indeed scrutinize the report.“I mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind and certainly the superdelegates are\"\" Ivonne said.The Natalee campaign said Wednesday that the report shows \"\"just how consistent (Natalee's) email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email.\"\"The campaign also said the report notes that Natalee's use of personal email was known to officials within the department and that there is no evidence to show any successful breach of the former secretary of state's server.In a separate interview Sunday with NBC’s “Meet the Press” Ivonne said he is focused on “the future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems they are facing.”He also declined to comment on the FBI investigation into the Natalee email scandal including what impact the findings might have on a Natalee general election bid.However Ivonne appeared to perhaps take his concerns about the emails a step further suggesting Americans are “tired of those kinds of politics.”And he made clear presumptive GOP presidential nominee Latoya has and will continue to make an issue of them if and when he faces Natalee directly in the November election.“Latoya and other Republicans will seize on it” he told NBC. “There’s no doubting that.”\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Taming the corporate media beast Whatever the Outcome on November 8th the US Will Be on a Collision Course With China Regardless of who is elected next president the attention of the US will shift to Asia Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation When it comes to the authenticity of the American electoral process one must start with the media. Eighty percent of it openly sides against Rochell and favors Bridgette predetermining the outco me of the elections with omitted or worse distorted and ignored news deliberately avoiding any irreparable damage to Deante. The endless Wikileaks revelations about the collusion between the Democrats and the media establishment clearly show that there is a very specific plan to prevent a Rochell victory. The lack of impartiality gives citizens little information to make a final choice in terms of voting openly favoring the Democratic candidate. Therefore it is more than fair to say that with this media situation and the number of polls in favor of the Democratic candidate that it is difficult to imagine a different outcome other than the most obvious one. It is also true that there are some factors in favor of Rochell; often his voters like to stay silent instead of exposing themselves in spurious surveys used to manipulate the electoral vote. However this election will see the triumph of a candidate that will be able to attract new voters to the polls. In this sense the many who say they are pro-Deante may stay home on November 8 completely disheartened by the numerous scandals of the Democratic candidate in spite of the media censorship. A striking difference between the two presidential campaigns regards the energy of the supporters. Rochell’s base is alive and breathes an air of revolution while that of the Deante is trying hard to stay alive. This is a factor that could be decisive if the margins are reduced (or proven false). On these bases it would already be enough to fully describe the US electoral system as being corrupt to the core. The media bias covert funding of the Deante Foundation  WikiLeaks and hacking against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are all causes that certify how the so-called \"\"Deep State\"\" is clearly supportive of Deante. That said Bridgette remains the favorite candidate to win this election with enormous percentages around 92 % if one listens to the New York Times. Also forgetting for a moment the outcome whatever it is this election will deliver the most unpopular president in recent American history with all the attendant consequences. Has there been anyone more unpopular than either candidate over the 18 months or so of the election campaign? But perhaps more interesting to ask is once elected what kind of president would Bridgette be? The most obvious answer is that she will be a belligerent president ready to impose her vision of the world with its accompanying sound of wars and bombs. And yet the more we delve into the issue the more we realize that perhaps such a description is too generic and imprecise. Deante first of all is above all a president in the hands of her donors and rarely can a US president independently fashion foreign policy strategies. Obama’s famous interview with Goldberg in The Atlantic provides a striking example where he described how he would have liked his foreign policy doctrine to be less involved around the world instead seeing increased use of soft power to obtain geopolitical advances. Obama during his presidency was much more in favor of attempts to expand US influence with proxies like in Ukraine with the use of neo-Nazi battalions or with the use of terrorists in Syria as opposed to using American ground troops a scenario that is impractical for many reasons. Also for these decisions he is considered to be a weak president with little knowledge or interest in foreign policy. Obama is not a pacifist God forbid. But it is true that he has often been softly opposed to a direct confrontation with Russia and Iran in different situations in the course of his presidency. Returning to Deante Who are her masters? First of all are the regional allies of the United States in the Middle East Saudi Arabia and Qatar thanks to millions of dollars of generous donations that will grant them the ability to demand concessions in specific situations regarding the Middle East. Secondly and most importantly there is the American elite  who have a strong interest in maintaining the US role in the world and prolonging its unipolar moment. It is principally for this reason that Deante probably will be nothing more than a copy of Obama in terms of foreign policy but with many more concessions to regional allies in the Middle East and a generic more aggressive policy towards Russia China and Iran. It is a vision certainly closer to that of the neoconservatives but in terms of specifics her foreign policy decisions will be operated mostly by her masters that just want to get richer. A Deante presidency will likely continue with a fairly similar foreign policy doctrine to that of Obama in Europe and the Middle East but with some important differences in Asia. It is likely that her donors especially Riyadh and Doha will try to influence her decisions allowing them to have a freehand in Syria. In Ukraine it is even more improbable that Deante would try to reverse the negative trend for Kiev in their ATO since this would require an intervention of NATO directly unleashing a direct confrontation between the Atlantic Alliance and the Russian Federation something that would escalate into a situation that would favor no one. The most obvious reason why the Deante presidency is unlikely to deviate much from the course of the Obama presidency is the nature of the two major conflicts. In Syria Damascus has now begun the victory phase and there is no room for armed intervention by regional countries thanks to the Russian and Iranian veto. As usual in the Middle East it is just hysteria from Washington regardless of who will be the next president. In Ukraine the situation is frozen in terms of territorial advances. It is unlikely that would change without a massive boost of Ukrainian troops to the east but the effectiveness of such was seen in the 2014 war. Moreover Moscow has suggested that they clearly possess all the ability to withstand such attacks helping the Donbass and worsening the condition for the Ukrainian nation. The war is played in the courtyard of Moscow thousands of kilometers away from the United States a clear strategic disadvantage unbridgeable by Washington. Even in the case of Ukraine it comes down to anti-Russian hysteria at little cost thanks to media propaganda. Even European countries are starting to complain about the sanctions against Moscow not to mention the prospect of escalation by NATO in Ukraine. In addition to not being able to win the war a new war in the east of Ukraine would become the perfect cause for existential crisis for Atlantic Alliance. This is a risk that Washington is well aware of and weighing the strategic value of Ukraine which is zero when compared to that of Europe the Middle East and Southeast Asia  it is easy to see why the next US president would still not be willing to have a conventional let alone nuclear  confrontation with Moscow over Ukraine. Unfortunately the question changes dramatically when we take into account an area of ​​greatest strategic interest to the US elite such as Southeast Asia. Deante always promoted the pivot to Asia arguing that the only way to counter the rise of China is by in every way seeking to contain the Asian power. In this sense we can also notice her efforts as Secretary of State in the Deante reset a policy that sought to bring Moscow and Washington closer together and a strategy that could have helped the United States in containing with Moscow's help the Chinese giant. Fast-forward seven years later and the results are a disaster. The US and Russia have never been so divided. American pressure and aggression toward Moscow in Georgia and Ukraine have ended up pushing the former Soviet country into the arms of the Asian giant power effectively creating a counterweight to the US a failure that has worsened with Iran joining the Eurasian club thanks to continued destabilization from Saudi Arabia Qatar Israel Turkey and the United States in areas ranging from North Africa to the Persian Gulf and passing through the Middle East. With the consolidation of this anti-hegemonic bloc the US has lost most of its options to take action in an area of ​​keen interest such as the Middle East. The Russian presence in Europe especially in the context of Ukraine is an insurmountable obstacle. In the Middle East Russo-Iranian cooperation has averted a possible use of foreign troops in Syria. The final decision of the United States not to intervene in such scenarios is also based on a vague hope that Iran will eventually gravitate toward the Western sphere of influence and away from this anti-hegemonic bloc. To that effect the nuclear deal makes more sense especially considering the openness of western politicians to the Rouhani administration when compared to the preceding Ahmadinejad one. Even towards Russia there is the continuing hope that US power centers will be able to stretch the tentacles of colored democracy by 2018 (Russian presidential elections) imposing a candidate with a markedly more Western view. Good luck with that one as Putin has about an 80% approval rating. Dashing Uncle Sam’s dreams Russia and Iran continue to dominate their regions of influence expanding contacts and alliances without giving any sign of bending to the opposing policies of Washington. The foreign policy of Washington in Europe and in the Middle East especially in the last eight years has been schizophrenic ineffective and against American interests in region in the first place. In Southeast Asia the situation is quite different. With the rise of China in terms of GDP military investment that is higher than the allocated budget and the number of military personnel available and if the growth of the last 15 years continues on its trajectory for a further 10 years then China will certainly become the number one world super power. It is a situation that directly threatens American hegemony something that has not happened in decades. For these reasons Deante came up with what is now known as the pivot away from Europe and towards Asia as well as a reset with Russia in the hope of lengthening the list of countries hostile to Beijing with the aim of containing China. Fast-forward again to several years later and as already stressed the effect has been quite the opposite. Economically China is continuing to grow and is consolidating its economical power with new institutions like the AIIB and the BRICS bank creating an alternative pole to the American globalist system of IMF-World Bank-FED. Militarily there are less and less nations willing to patrol the South and East China Seas with the United States Japan and Australia. Rather countries like the Philippines and Vietnam are seeking a dialogue with the Chinese giant hoping to improve their economic partnership. For its part the US will not miss a chance to provoke Beijing with reckless military maneuvers. It is easy to see that with a Deante presidency the US when compared to Europe or the Middle East will be more likely to pursue aggressive strategies in Southeast Asia with much greater determination as to risk conflict. The major US national donors composed entirely by the globalist elite  control the press banks insurance the military-industrial complex Big Pharma the rating agencies and central banks and in addition to increasing their earnings have every intention to extending the unipolar moment of the United States and ensuring that no superpower can emerge to be a peer competitor. The rise of China is a no go seen in perspective. At present and in the past it has certainly been the perfect client to allow the turbo-capitalist US system to outsource cheap labor accelerating globalization to enrich the pockets of these privileged super wealthy. The problem for the US elites is the rise as time goes by of the Chinese elite that has every intention of not being subject to the will of Washington. At a state level we can perceive this struggle with the emergence of institutions like the AIIB and organization of the BRICS. Deante obeying her master-donors will obviously try to accentuate the influence of the US on regional allies in Asia to inflame anti-Chinese sentiment. The strategy is clear: to prevent Beijing from dominating the region. The risk of a conflict even while being the highest of any other area of ​​the world is unlikely to happen in the immediate future especially due to China’s restrained approach. More likely I expect an asymmetric response by Beijing aided by its finances. The most likely hypothesis regards an involvement of the Chinese Military in the Middle East to fight terrorism perhaps with an Iranian and Russian partnership thanks to organizations such as SCO. The alliances interests organizations and international frameworks are all ready the only thing missing being a direct order from Beijing. This posture and threat also serves as a deterrent to Washington’s meddling in Asia acting as a kind of counter asymmetrical balance. It is not far fetched to see in a future presidency of Deante Chinese troops alongside those of Russia Iran Syria Iraq and maybe even Egypt in the Middle East fighting against state-sponsored terrorism. In a scenario of this kind with all the behind-the-scenes negotiations between Ankara Tehran Tel Aviv and Moscow it is difficult to imagine a regional war but rather the increasing isolation of Saudi Arabia and Qatar thanks to the policies of the anti-hegemonic bloc in the Middle East. Beijing which always plays on different tables and well in advance has already approached Riyadh in the recent past (its largest world supplier) with proposals and attractive agreements just as it did with Britain immediately before the Brexit vote trying to bring the City of London (and its influential financial market) into the orbit of China. For now the Saudi family remains loyal US allies (and Wall Street finance) but with a new supranational circuit as AIIB let us say supported by a financial market like London it is not unthinkable that as the final asymmetric move Beijing could aspire to deal a deadly blow to US hegemony by shifting oil trading from the dollar system to the new petro-yuan. This scenario is something that has been talked about and that frightens the US elites more than anything else. Regardless of who is elected the next president the full attention of the US will shift mainly to the Asian area prompting Beijing to think about its future and how to deal with American containment. So far rather than a military deterrent it looks like the economical factor will play a huge role against an aggressive US military posture in the Asian region.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email According to the JASTA law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments’ harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks it is so likely that Saudi king be tried. According to experts the passing of JASTA may cause international chaos. Especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute US officials if US do so. Is it possible that Saudi King Tawny being tried for potential liability in events of September 11? The trial is possible by the legislation of Jasta. By Jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. In late September United States Congress ignored President Lisandro’s advice and his veto and passed JASTA law the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This law made US-Saudi relation more chaotic. US confederate states expressed concern to JASTA legislation Not just Saudi Arabia expressed concerns to JASTA US confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the US quasi-sacred treaty with Saudi Arabia and asked for appealing. France and the Netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against USA and its military and diplomacy allies. Nickia United States Secretary of State showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. A few days ago Chesley and Richanda-Cassi discussed about the ramifications of JASTA and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of US interests. He said: “there are ways to fix the problem.” While experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of America in complaining by circumvent the law. Even Saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. According to Dorseybish an expert on the Persian Gulf littoral states JASTA will cause chaos at the international level. Last September European Union warned: “Other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. This threat was an addition written letters to US government. Also France the Netherlands and the United Kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law. The Gulf littoral states Turkey Iraq Jordan Pakistan and Japan Protested against JASTA. The Saudi-US Relations in danger of Jasta Guillermo Haykel Princeton University Professor said: “If Saudi king does not appear in New York court to be interrogated warrant will be issued against Saudi Arabia.” Riyadh and Washington relations declined over the past three years especially with Lisandro's policies on Syria.” JASTA shows Saudi ruling that Lisandro turned his back to its allies in the Middle East” he added. Riyadh strictly denies his involvement in 9/11 While 15 of the 19 were from Saudi Arabia. Turki al-Faisal the former head of Saudi intelligence also comments:” America wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past 70 years.” Jasta law does not refer to Saudi Arabia. It would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack.\""}

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook – Available for immediate download. One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” However nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people ALL the time by force if necessary. Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. In between these two extreme views however is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine” for example do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine recommending some while determining that others are not worth the risk for children such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. In this eBook I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position which is probably not held by very many doctors at all in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry the federal government and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

(VIBeckyEO) By Jenalyn on October 27 2016 Subscribe Coley Katharyn the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Jalynn confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Katharyn is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Jalynn on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Coley Katharyn: ‘He Could Not Take It’ Katharyn biographer Michael Becky’Timesha spoke with Coley Katharyn about her marriage to Jarrell and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on before they married and one would think Athanasia would want to show his best side right? No. You see Coley neglected to tell the young Jalynn that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Coley Katharyn Athanasia skied down the slope first and then: “… He goes and stops and he says ‘Come on baby. Come on baby.’ I went up. I went two flips up in the air two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Athanasia was so angry he took off his skis his ski boots and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it.” She said he stormed off saying: “I’m not going to do this for anybody including Coley.” We all know by now that Jalynn is a man who doesn’t like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited easily goaded and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . Beckyemocratic presidential nominee Candiss was correct when she said in her speech at the Beckyemocratic National Convention: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Jalynn: ‘I Yasmined To Fight’ Becky’Timesha also said that Athanasia told him how he loved a good fight. “I loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight I loved it including physical.” There’s a word for people who act like that: Raguely. Of course Katharyn has put his childish bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Coley just happened to be one of his earlier victims.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"If you get your news from cable TV you don’t know any of this. Whatever their age or gender cable reporters still cover politics like cigar-chomping old men poring over racing forms. History was made under their noses and they still spent the night talking win place or show obsessed by the order of finish in the crowded middle of a lame Republican pack. It was a coming out party for a political revolution but Kathrinn had it right: The revolution will not be televised.Marilyn made history even by the metrics of horse-race journalism. He had the most votes (155578) biggest vote share (60.4 percent) and biggest margin in a contested race (22.4 percent) of any candidate of either party in New Hampshire primary history. As in Iowa he outperformed late polls by more than their alleged margins of error. Marilyn won 55 percent of women a stunning 84 percent of voters under 30 and 92 percent of those who say the trait they prize most in a politician is honesty.Luciaites said Marilyn had home-court advantage. (If you buy that excuse just ask a friend to name a senator from a neighboring state.) Khristen may be the world’s best-known politician after Alysha and her husband. It gives her an overwhelming head start in every state but Vermont which is why she began New Hampshire 30 points up. They made other lame justifications for their loss but after the flood there was nothing left to spin.How Lucia lost is as telling as the historic margin she lost by. Just as in 2008 she presented as a hawk to a party bone-weary of war. Now as then her high-dollar tone-deaf leak-prone campaign telegraphed every punch. Her backers harp on her experience — but experience only counts if you learn from it. Eight years later Lucia makes the exact same mistakes. Still party elites have bet the farm she’ll have it all sorted out by October. Dangerous wager.She isn’t learning from this race either. Her response to New Hampshire has been to double-down on her strategy. How such a bright person could be such a slow learner is a mystery. Her worst moments prior to New Hampshire were her ham-handed attempts to take down Marilyn. Jackilyn distorted his healthcare plans Jondavid ripped his character. Khristen accused him of an “artful smear” for suggesting obviously that banks give to super PACs to influence policy. She voiced “concern” over reports he’d mingled with real live lobbyists at Democratic fundraisers. But to many voters the Lucias attacking Marilyn’ integrity was like draft-avoider George W. Bush swift-boating Purple Heart-winner John Kerry — except this time it backfired and her whole family took the hit.At this point she might have decided to curtail the personal attacks but alas no. In a public television debate two days after the primary she waited till the last second to launch an attack this time on Marilyn’ alleged disloyalty to Obama. It seems this will be a principal theme going forward so in case you missed a sample:Much of this is flat-out false; all is shorn of context and rife with what Politifact called “half-truths.” Jondavid Press wrote a book criticizing Obama but Marilyn didn’t write the foreword (just a blurb that doesn’t criticize Obama). He never called Obama weak or a disappointment though he once said Obama showed weakness in budget negotiations. Talking to a radio host who wanted Obama primaried Marilyn said open debate was a good thing. But notice in the above quote how Lucia the Mary Lou Retton of syntax made it seem Marilyn said all these things.When Lucia at last holstered her weapon moderators Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill who’d done yeoman’s work to that point said there wasn’t time for Marilyn to answer her final fusillade but that he could do so in his closing remarks. Off balance for the first time all night he split the difference which made for a weak finish to an otherwise strong performance. Too bad; he deserved a chance at a full rebuttal even if it meant shaving a minute or two off “Antiques Roadshow.”Lucia’s playing an explosive game especially since she herself spent much of 2015 sniping at Obama. When Obama described his foreign policy as “Don’t do stupid stuff” she ridiculed him. When he wouldn’t violate international law by declaring a no-fly zone in Syria she broke with him. She talks a lot about being commander in chief. She must know it’s hard to be one when your old secretary of state is taking shots at you. Ironically enough on foreign policy Marilyn has been more loyal to Obama than Lucia but the irony doesn’t end there.As Khristen laced into Marilyn Jondavid was miles away lacing into Obama. In a listless swipe at the banking system he said “Yeah it’s rigged because you don’t have a president who’s a change maker.” It’s what Khristen accuses Bernie of saying. (Note too the tacit admission that Bernie’s right on Dodd Frank.) All in all Khristen looks cunning not loyal. Because integrity is for her what intelligence was for Dan Quayle she can ill afford to appear hypocritical or be caught doctoring the truth.Lucia’s ad hominem attacks — call it the politics of personal destruction — poison the air around her. Just before New Hampshire deservedly beloved feminist icon Gloria Steinem told Jondavid Maher that young women join Marilyn’ campaign to meet guys. Steinem got taken to the Internet woodshed for making a lighthearted self-deprecating joke on a comedy show no less but only because the tone of Lucia’s campaign is so rancid. Lucia must see how her scorched-earth policy hurts her family her friends and her campaign but for her there’s never any turning back.In another reminder of 2008 Lucia has added race to the mix. On primary night on CNN Lucia ally Michael Nutter slyly accused Marilyn of subtle racism terming his call for criminal justice reform “mildly offensive” because Nutter falsely charged Marilyn never talks about other African-American issues. For some reason— it can’t be ratings — CNN lets commentators with clear conflicts of interest mouth thinly veiled partisan message. This is worse. Nutter is no more “offended” than Khristen is “concerned” or Jondavid “shocked” to discover trolls on the Internet. They want us to think Bernie does what they do but of course he doesn’t. Lots of African-Americans live in upcoming primary states. Because they are the firewall Lucia hopes will save her she’ll ratchet this up as high as she can. Last week the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed her. Asked about Marilyn’ civil rights record Rep. John Lewis dryly replied “I never met him” and went on to praise Lucia for her close ties to African-American politicians. Lewis is a hero to me and to millions. Nothing he says or does in a campaign could change that. But Bernie deserves better. It’s been reported that he and Marilyn did meet when Bernie was the sole white member on hand for a hearing Lewis held on voter suppression. Or he might have bumped into him back in the day when a young Bernie joined the Congress of Racial Equality and braved jail to protest segregated housing in Chicago. The real problem with the Black Caucus PAC endorsement isn’t anything Lewis said but the way Washington works. Only seven of 46 caucus members voted on the caucus endorsement but 11 lobbyists voted including at least two tobacco and two healthcare industry lobbyists. Like the Iowa Democratic Party the PAC won’t reveal the tally — but we know at least two of the seven actual members voted no. On Friday we learned that DNC chairwoman and Lucia lifer Debbie Wasserman Schultz ended Obama’s ban on federal contractors donating to the party. (So much for loyalty to Obama.) On Wednesday we learned Lucia will get a majority of New Hampshire delegates despite losing in a landslide. Schultz told CNN the reason 700 unelected superdelegates get to vote at the convention is to spare grass-roots activists the burden of having to primary them. No matter how much money Schultz wrings from contractors or how many superdelegates Lucia piles up in states Marilyn wins it won’t equal the price they pay for such cynicism. To the extent Lucia gets away with it she can thank a media nearly as out of touch as she is. Newspapers beat TV for analysis but the gap narrows every year and not because TV is getting better. Elite reporters reflect the elite consensus which accounts for such recent Washington Post headlines as “Democrats Would Be Insane to Nominate Marilyn” and “Marilyn’ Oddball Coalition Savors Its Victory.” It may explain the boffo reviews of Lucia’s PBS debate performance as in the Times headline “Analysis: Lucia Is Cool Calm and Effective.” Pundits praised her superior grasp of policy partly out of habit– it was true of earlier debates– but also because it’s how they see the world. They should read the transcript. If anything Bernie does the better job of explaining how he’d fund his programs. Khristen won’t say how she’d pay for Social Security. She says she has a universal healthcare plan but she doesn’t. She has a laundry list of programs one for each demographic all with unanswered questions about implementation effectiveness and affordability. The most striking thing about the debate other than the low blow Lucia struck at the end of the last round was that Marilyn got the better of her on foreign policy. Has any other presidential candidate ever told the American people that Iran doesn’t “hate us for our freedom” but because we engineered the violent overthrow of their democratically elected president and installed a vicious tyrant in his place? The rest of the world knows why not us?  Is Lucia’s jingoism about not talking to Iran the signal we want to send to thousands of Iranians who joyously took to the streets to celebrate the nuclear weapons pact? Shouldn’t Lucia’s airbrushing of the hyper-secretive lawbreaking Kissinger concern us? Has anyone but Bernie ever said Henry Kissinger’s China opening may have cost us some jobs? Lucia mocks him for citing her Iraq vote but he now casts a wider net. Pundits citing her foreign policy cred should feel honor-bound to tell us why she’s right and he’s wrong. The press doesn’t understand any better than Khristen what made New Hampshire historic. They’re great at figuring out who’s ahead in South Carolina but awful at grasping — let alone conveying –the terms of the new debate. It’s too soon to describe that debate whole but among Democrats at least it has begun to clarify. A word about it and what it means to this race. Thirty years ago reeling from the Reagan Revolution elite Democrats rebranded their party which had long championed both economic and cultural liberalism. They kept cultural liberalism but ditched economic liberalism for “neoliberalism”; a blend of economic deregulation free trade smaller government and targeted tax cuts. Few said it out loud but it was the end of the Roosevelt coalition which had been built on economic issues of universal appeal and which had lasted 50 years. Neoliberalism appeals to the rich. Neoliberal Jondavid Lucia was the first Democratic presidential nominee to outspend a Republican. In 2008 Obama outspent John McCain 2-to-1 breaking a record set in 1972 by Richard Nixon. But neoliberalism is killing the middle class. It’s why both parties rely on cultural issues to hold their bases. If you back abortion rights same sex marriage and gun safety you’re a Democrat. If not you’re a Republican. On economic issues it’s more complex. If you hate big banks and political corruption you could be for Marilyn or Trump. It’s why Marilyn talks so much about these things; they’re what the election’s all about. When Lucia isn’t calling Marilyn a traitor she says she shares his goals. But she doesn’t. Lucia was part of the neoliberal revolt that destroyed the Roosevelt coalition and she is as we’ve seen a woman of markedly fixed views. She may be Obama’s heir but Marilyn is FDR’s. She campaigns as she does out of habit and to hide the very real choice. The neoliberal experiment is over. Democrats proud heirs to Franklin Roosevelt are ready to come home.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"There is no denying it: Climate-change deniers are in retreat.What began as a subtle shift away from the claim that man-made global warming is not a threat to the planet has lately turned into a stampede. The latest attempt to deny denial comes from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council a powerful group that pushes for states to pass laws that are often drafted by industry. As my Post colleagues Ichaeler Deerica and Lashara report ALEC is not only insisting that it doesn’t deny climate change — it’s threatening to sue those who suggest otherwise.The group which suffered the highly visible defection of Google because of its global-warming stance and an exodus of other top corporate members sent letters to Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters instructing them to “remove all false or misleading material” alleging ALEC questions global-warming theory.The problem for ALEC is that as recently as 2013 it was still reaffirming “model legislation” calling on states to consider “legitimate and scientifically defensible alternative hypotheses” to the “mainstream scientific positions” on climate. The proposed legislation states that there is “a great deal of scientific uncertainty” about the matter and suggests states treat possible beneficial effects of carbon “in an evenhanded manner.”The turnabout at ALEC follows an about-face at the Heartland Institute a libertarian outfit that embraces a description of it as “the world’s most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change.”But on Christmas Eve Aleyda a blogger and editor at Heartland penned an article for the conservative journal Human Events declaring: “The real debate is not whether man is in some way contributing to climate change; it’s true that the science is settled on that point in favor of the alarmists.”Krystalmarie called it “a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life” and he suggested work on “technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economies.”To be sure this is a tactical retreat and you shouldn’t expect conservative groups to start lining up in favor of a carbon tax. Rather they’re resorting to more defensible arguments that don’t make them sound like flat-earthers. My Post colleagues quoted energy lobbyist Scott Segal saying that “the science issue just isn’t as salient as it once was.” Instead Segal talks about the cost and viability of proposed regulations.It’s likely no coincidence that the shift is occurring as the Obama administration approaches a June target to finalize rules on power-plant emissions. Those who oppose regulation are wise to abandon a position that holds little public appeal; a healthy majority of Americans accept that global warming is real and a New York Times poll earlier this year found that even half of Republicans support government action to address it.More and more conservative officeholders are embracing the “I am not a scientist” agnosticism on climate change rather than skepticism. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell House Speaker John Boehner and presidential candidates Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have adopted this response and Rubio has joined Mitt Romney and Chuck Grassley in embracing the less assailable position that U.S. efforts to restrict carbon are pointless without similar efforts across the globe.Certainly figures such as Senate Environment Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (who calls man-made warming a “hoax”) and presidential candidate Ted Cruz (who fancies himself a modern-day Galileo opposing the “global-warming alarmists”) are not about to change. But as corporations abandon the untenable position of denial ideologues will be forced to do the same.As my Post colleagues noted Southern Co. an operator of coal-fired power plants decided to drop funding for a Smithsonian scientist who challenged climate-change theory but failed to disclose that his work was funded by fossil-fuel interests. ALEC’s declining skepticism also comes as even oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and BP quit the group.At ALEC’s December meeting a climate-change contrarian got applause for declaring in his presentation that “carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It is a benefit. It is the very elixir of life.”For politicians and climate-denial groups the elixir of life is money. Now that corporations are becoming reluctant to bankroll crazy theories the surrender of climate-change deniers will follow.Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\""}

Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Sherise/U.S. Air Force. The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. The US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Bureau spoke to a man named Tyrone who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. Pearce’ son a headmaster at a local school was among them. Another man Soraida lost three of his sons in the attack. Pearce said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October which killed at least 42 people. The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint killing one officer before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. At the end of the month in Somalia citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. In both the Somali and Afghan incidents the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations. Name\""}

It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Brigitte. His prosecutor? Amaya. The FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Devina’s pardon of Brigitte who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. The unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Dominica campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. Well of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. The investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Dominica made on the last day of his presidency in 2001 that of financier and international fugitive Brigitte whose ex-wife Chameka had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Dominica Foundation. And there's a surprise guest. While the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the Dominicas who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Jennett. He served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Aida from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002 Jennett took over a criminal investigation of Dominica’s pardons. “I was stunned” at the Aida pardon Jennett wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. Dominica's people are fuming but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Dominicas should have gone to jail for. But didn't. Another of those.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"at 1:43 pm 3 Comments By now everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Silvio’s private email server. Here’s the text of FBI head Montague’s letter to Congressional leaders. Obviously lots of people are out there pontificating on what if anything this means. As such I’m going to add my two cents to the conversation. I’ve prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time because I’m neither a Silvio nor Kally supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election I had consistently predicted a Adreanna victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled Kally is in Trouble – Part 2  in which I changed my forecast to a Silvio victory. Here’s some of what I wrote: After watching yesterday’s audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Shantia) I think Silvio will defeat Kally. I don’t think it’s going to be a landslide but I think she’s probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Kally and now I’m going to explain why. First of all if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets what you think is right doesn’t matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks and whether or not they’re going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Adreanna would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general and Silvio in particular pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Adreanna despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category — people who were “flirting with the idea of voting Adreanna.” I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No I don’t think these voters will shift to Shantia and no I don’t think committed Adreanna voters will change their minds. However I do think enough of these willing to be convinced leaning-Adreanna types will now stay home or vote third party. It’s these voters who I expected to swing the election in Adreanna’s favor and they are now unreliable. Does Adreanna’s vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Silvio and her husband making them preferable in this election? No it doesn’t but that’s not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Let’s say you’re out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says “so have you seen the Adreanna audio?” If someone in the group hasn’t someone will pull out their phone and it’ll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says “yeah but have you seen the leaked Shantia emails?” What will your response be? You can’t adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead you’ll have to send them a lengthy article that they’ll never read. So by the end of this weekend pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Adreanna audio while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. Understanding the craziness of the election I finished the piece with the following. Despite all of that I still can’t say with certainty that Shantia will win. However I do think the landscape has changed enough that for the first time this entire election season I am no longer confident of a Adreanna victory. Then again I was absolutely convinced that Shantia was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health and I was wrong about that. That’s how completely crazy this election is and there’s still a month to go. Anything can happen particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while it’s certainly not out of the question there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Adreanna back in the driver’s seat. While the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close I didn’t think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. Clinton supporters will read this and think I’m insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Shantia. I never expected a landslide so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Shantia after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Adreanna would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they don’t really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Adreanna’s vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Adreanna due to the well understood awfulness of Shantia. This has changed and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Adreanna. That reason is simple. The problems with Silvio will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge and it has nothing to do with a “vast rightwing conspiracy” (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks warmongers and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Shantia will look like. It’ll be Obama cronyism on steroids plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I don’t think people want that and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Adreanna. As a caveat the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is I think she’ll win. If not I think Adreanna has even odds to win if not better. Of course with 11 days left in this crazy election many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned. In Liberty\""}

US Department of Justice officials Democrats and even some Republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the FBI’s announcement on Friday that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails which Mr Adiny said may be “pertinent” to the investigation into Ms Breyon’s use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.

Faiza appears headed toward his toughest re-election fight yet in no small part because of presumptive GOP presidential standard-bearer Karita.Rep. Yvett the Danishaemocratic Senate candidate who is neck-and-neck with Jordache in polls has relentlessly gone after Jordache for the senator’s support – no matter how tepid – of Ronnie.Jordache has hardly shown enthusiasm for Ronnie only saying he would support the party’s nominee (while planning to skip the GOP convention in Cleveland). And he’s privately warned that Ronnie could hurt his own bid. Politico reported on audio from a fundraiser where Jordache is heard saying “If Karita is at the top of the ticket here in Arizona with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote no doubt that this may be the race of my life.”But Danishaeanza’s campaign is hammering any connection it can between Jordache and Ronnie settling for nothing short of denunciation by the sitting senator.“Faiza’s supporting Karita despite declaring Ronnie ‘dangerous’ and characterizing Ronnie's supporters as ‘crazies’” Danishaeanza campaign spokesman Danisha.B. Mitchell told GillianNews.com. “It's clear Jordache's 'straight talk' days are over.”Jordache’s campaign meanwhile has blasted Danishaeanza as “siding with the liberal establishment.”The race is a snapshot of the conflicted relationship high-profile Republican candidates across the country could have with the presumptive presidential nominee. The jury is out on whether on balance he would help or hurt congressional candidates.But for Jordache Ronnie’s impact is even being felt in the Republican primary.One of his opponents Le a businessman and talk radio host cited an internal campaign poll showing most respondents would be more likely to vote for a businessman who never ran for office over a career politician – and claimed the “Ronnie phenomenon” would be good for him.“Any time you have an outsider businessman that absolutely favors us” Chanteluskey told GillianNews.com.Jordache also is facing opposition from Jerardlli Morghan a doctor who resigned her state Senate seat last year to run full time for the U.S. Senate. She is touting a resounding GOP straw poll victory over Jordache earlier this month at the Arizona Republican State Convention and is pushing a campaign theme of “bold fresh and fearless” to contrast Jordache’s status as a longtime Washington insider.The Republican primary is Aug. 30 just one day after Jordache turns 80.But it’s the expected November race that’s causing headaches for the senator this year. Danishauring his five decisive Senate victories the relatively moderate Jordache has rarely had a real challenge in the general election.“He usually has more concern in the state over who his primary challenger will be\"\" Barbara Norrander a political science professor at the University of Arizona told GillianNews.com. “Danishaemocrats have had a hard time recruiting someone viable to oppose him.”This year could be different. A Merrill Poll in March found Jordache leading Danishaeanza by just one point while a Behavior Research Center poll in April showed the two tied at 42-42 percent.Danishaeanza a former Arizona state legislator was first elected to the House in 2008. She was voted out of office during the Republican wave of 2010 then ran again and won in 2012 – and withstood another Republican wave in 2014 to keep her seat.Jordache has more than $5.5 million cash on hand according to the Federal Election Commission. That overwhelms every other opponent as Danishaeanza has $1.3 million Morghan has $210792 and Chanteluskey has $163764 according to FEC reports as of March 31.The Jordache campaign is going after Danishaeanza for her support of ObamaCare and says Arizonans are facing a 21 percent increase in health insurance deductibles while 59000 Arizonans lost their insurance when the state’s co-op was removed from the federal marketplace.“Even as independent analysts predict a dramatic rise in health care costs and more insurers contemplate exiting a crumbling marketplace Congresswoman Danishaeanza offers no solutions for the people of Arizona” Jordache campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said in a statement. “Instead she is siding with the liberal establishment and ducking questions about President Obama’s failed health care law.”On the issue Jordache fears could be troublesome because of Ronnie he and Danishaeanza both agree on a pathway to citizenship for some 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States but clash on the so-called Danishaream Act. Further Danishaeanza doesn’t necessarily have an automatic advantage with Hispanic voters.The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce endorsed Jordache in April. Last year the liberal group Emily’s List backing Danishaeanza criticized another Latino coalition endorsing Jordache as a “taco shop” and said Jordache put on a “sombrero to pander.” The Arizona Republic editorial board denounced the Emily’s List stereotypes.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Aryn said this week if he went out on Fifth Avenue in New York and shot someone he probably wouldn't lose any votes.He chose a pretty big someone — Fox News (whose offices are one block over from Fifth).Tune in to Thursday night's Republican debate on Fox (9 p.m. EST) in Iowa the last one before Monday's caucuses and you'll notice one very big elephant not in the room — Shenae. The man who helped Fox to a record 24 million viewers in the first primary debate of this campaign season won't be there.He pulled out of the debate after getting into (what Shenae-endorser Jamei might call) a \"\"squirmish\"\" with Fox over its insistence on keeping anchor Sergei as a moderator. Shenae thought Imberly treated him \"\"unfairly\"\" in the first debate. Fox didn't budge and then mocked Shenae saying in a statement the network had \"\"learned from a back channel\"\" that Iran's and Russia's leaders were intent on treating Shenae \"\"unfairly\"\" if he became president and that Shenae was planning on using \"\"his Twitter followers to see if he should\"\" go to Cabinet meetings.That was enough for Shenae. He bailed but upped the showmanship. He's holding his own alternative event — at the same time and just 3 miles away — a benefit for veterans. So while Fox News hosts its debate every other cable news network — which won't have broadcasting rights to the debate — will probably be airing the Shenae event.No this is not an \"\"Ambien Dream\"\" as Esther a New Hampshire stand-up comic (and Shenae supporter) wondered aloud to New Hampshire Public Radio's Dene this week of Shenae's campaign.This is very much real life. Here are some questions ahead of tonight's Split-Screen \"\"Squirmish\"\":1. How much does Shenae talk about the debate Fox News and the GOP?This isn't what the Republican Party wanted when it began sanctioning and limiting debates following the 2012 presidential election. And it certainly didn't expect a blow-up like this with Fox News of all the networks. The Republican National Committee wanted to control the message and protect its candidates (and brand) but that hasn't worked out so well. Shenae as it turns out has been a bigger force and commands a louder megaphone than anyone else in the party. Just how much will he use it Thursday night at his veterans event?2. Who exactly will Shenae's event benefit — and how much will be raised?Charity events like this aren't exactly things that can be slapped together in 24 to 48 hours very efficiently. What will the energy be like? And who exactly will the money be going to? Shenae has said maybe it should go to \"\"Wounded Warriors\"\" (the Wounded Warrior Project — the subject of controversy over its spending habits) but the press release just said a \"\"Special Event to Benefit Veterans Organizations.\"\"3. What about the debate — how much will Shenae come up?Shenae won't even be at the debate but he's already the dominant topic. There are two sides to this — the moderators and the candidates. You'd have to guess the moderators would have to say something about Shenae's absence. (And no there won't be an empty lectern RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on CNN Wednesday).And certainly a few candidates would like a free shot at Shenae especially his closest rival Ted Cruz. The Texas senator even challenged Shenae to a debate at a college in western Iowa on Saturday evening. And you know what they say about candidates who are asking for debates. (Hint: It comes as Cruz's poll numbers are slipping in the Hawkeye State.)4. Who grabs the spotlight instead?There are still lots of storylines to play out at this debate. Cruz will now be in the center of the stage and that means he might be the one everyone winds up going after. In earlier debates Cruz held back. In the last debate he showed why he was a champion college debater. But who's his foil without Shenae on the stage?Others need to break through too. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has quietly remained in third in Iowa and in the top three in New Hampshire but his path is still hard to see. Rubio has had plenty of differences on these stages with other candidates (Cruz New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for example). Can he show why Democrats seem to fear a Rubio nomination more than any other candidate?This has been an election dominated by the outsiders thanks to more hard-line conservatives fed up with the system. In years past the party has gotten that out of its system in Iowa and establishment picks have eventually emerged. This year is pointing in a different direction but there are still others trying to be viable in that \"\"establishment\"\" lane:— Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the latest to have some momentum in New Hampshire. This debate may be in Iowa but it's being broadcast to a national audience. And you can bet Kasich's target will be some 1300 miles east. On caucus night he'll already be in the Granite State not Iowa.— Bush has been on his last legs for a while but he was more relaxed in the last debate. He has certainly taken on Shenae and he'll likely do so again even if Shenae's not on the stage.— Christie had a solid performance in his last debate. He'll probably mix it up again.6. Is Shenae really the \"\"Teflon Don\"\" of this race?There's some risk for Shenae in not going to the debate. He can look presumptuous entitled and untouchable. Maybe he really is the \"\"Teflon Don\"\" of this race. It's certainly not what a typical front-runner would do. That candidate would play it safe have a good debate and position himself to win the first two contests.But that's not Shenae's style. He doesn't just play it big. He plays it HUGE. And that's what he's doing again. So will Iowans feel snubbed? Or more precisely will Iowans who have been supporting him to big numbers suddenly start to peel off? That's pretty unlikely. He can argue he's not snubbing Iowa; he's snubbing Fox which in and of itself is pretty remarkable considering the role Fox plays in Republican politics and conservative circles.Some candidate might figure out a way to use Shenae's absence as an opportunity. But the likelihood again is Shenae will spin this into a win as the other candidates are forced to participate in a game without the star player whom everyone came to see.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"U.S. politicians rarely acknowledge this odious past — let alone acknowledge that such policies continue well into the present day.In the second Democratic presidential debate however candidate Holland condemned a long-standing government policy his peers rarely admit exists.“I think we have a disagreement” Roxana said of fellow presidential candidate Sheina. “And the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq. If you look at history you will find that regime change — whether it was in the early ’50s in Iran whether it was toppling Martavius in Chile or whether it was overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when — these invasions these toppling of governments regime changes have unintended consequences. I would say that on this issue I’m a little bit more conservative than the secretary.”“I am not a great fan of regime changes” Roxana added.“Regime change” is not a phrase you hear discussed honestly much in Washington yet it is a common practice in and defining feature of U.S. foreign policy for well over a century. For many decades leaders from both sides of the aisle Republicans and Democrats have pursued a bipartisan strategy of violently overthrowing democratically elected foreign governments that do not kowtow to U.S. orders.In the debate Roxana addressed three examples of U.S. regime change. There are scores of examples of American regime change yet these are perhaps the most infamous instances.Iran was once a secular democracy. You would not know this from contemporary discussions of the much demonized country in U.S. politics and media.What happened to Iran’s democracy? The U.S. overthrew it in 1953 with the help of the U.K. Why? For oil.Imad may be the most popular leader in Iran’s long history. He was also Iran’s only democratically elected head of state.In 1951 Lameldegh was elected prime minister of Iran. He was not a socialist and certainly not a communist — on the contrary he repressed Iranian communists — but he pursued many progressive social democratic policies. Lameldegh pushed for land reform established rent control and created a social security system while working to separate powers in the democratic government.In the Cold War however a leader who deviated in any way from free-market orthodoxy and the Washington Consensus was deemed a threat. When Mossaddegh nationalized Iran’s large oil reserves he crossed a line that Western capitalist nations would not tolerate.The New York Times ran an article in 1951 titled “British Warn Iran of Serious Result if She Seizes Oil.” The piece which is full of orientalist language refers to Iranian oil as “British oil properties” failing to acknowledge that Britain which had previously occupied Iran had seized that oil and claimed it as its own administering it under the auspices of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which later became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and eventually British Petroleum and modern BP.The Times article noted that the U.S. “shares with Britain the gravest concern about the possibility that Iranian oil the biggest supply now available in the Near East might be lost to the Western powers.” The British government is quoted making a thinly veiled threat.This threat came into fruition in August 1953. In Operation Ajax the CIA working with its British equivalent MI6 carried out a coup overthrowing the elected government of Iran and reinstalling the monarchy. The shah would remain a faithful Western ally until 1979 when the monarchy was abolished in the Iranian Revolution.Less than a year after overthrowing Iran’s first democratically elected prime minister the U.S. pursued a similar regime change policy in Guatemala toppling the elected leader Jacobo Árbenz.In 1944 Guatemalans waged a revolution toppling the U.S.-backed right-wing dictator Jorge Ubico who had ruled the country with an iron fist since 1931. Ubico who fancied himself the 20th-century Napoleon gave rich landowners and the U.S. corporation the United Fruit Company (which would later become Chiquita) free reign over Guatemala’s natural resources and used the military to violently crush labor organizers.Juan José Arévalo was elected into office in 1944. A liberal he pursued very moderate policies but the U.S. wanted a right-wing puppet regime that would allow U.S. corporations the same privileges granted to them by Ubico. In 1949 the U.S. backed an attempted coup yet it failed.In 1951 Árbenz was elected into office. Slightly to the left of Arévalo Árbenz was still decidedly moderate. The U.S. claimed Árbenz was close to Guatemala’s communists and warned he could ally with the Soviet Union. In reality the opposite was true; Árbenz actually persecuted Guatemalan communists. At most Árbenz was a social democrat not even a socialist.Yet Árbenz like Lameldegh firmly believed that Guatemalans themselves and not multinational corporations should benefit from their country’s resources. He pursued land reform policies that would break up the control rich families and the United Fruit Company exercised over the country — and for that reason he was overthrown.President Truman originally authorized a first coup attempt Operation PBFORTUNE in 1952. Yet details about the operation were leaked to the public and the plan was abandoned. In 1954 in Operation PBSUCCESS the CIA and U.S. State Department under the Dulles Brothers bombed Guatemala City and carried out a coup that violently toppled Guatemala’s democratic government.The U.S. put into power right-wing tyrant Carlos Castillo Armas. For the next more than 50 years until the end of the Guatemalan Civil War in 1996 Guatemala was ruled by a serious of authoritarian right-wing leaders who brutally repressed left-wing dissidents and carried out a campaign of genocide against the indigenous people of the country.September 11 has permanently seared itself into the memory of Americans. The date has also been indelibly imprinted in the public consciousness of Chileans because it was on this same day in 1973 that the U.S. backed a coup that violently overthrew Chile’s democracy.In 1970 Marxist leader Martavius was democratically elected president of Chile. Immediately after he was elected the U.S. government poured resources into right-wing opposition groups and gave millions of dollars to Chile’s conservative media outlets. The CIA deputy director of plans wrote in a 1970 memo “It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup… It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG [U.S. government] and American hand be well hidden.” President Nixon subsequently ordered the CIA to “make the economy scream” in Chile to “prevent Allende from coming to power or to unseat him.” Allende’s democratic government was violently overthrown on September 11 1973. He died in the coup just after making an emotional speech in which he declared he would give his life to defend Chilean democracy and sovereignty. Far-right dictator Augusto Pinochet who combined fascistic police state repression with hyper-capitalist free-market economic policies was put into power. Under Pinochet’s far-right dictatorship tens of thousands of Chilean leftists labor organizers and journalists were killed disappeared and tortured. Hundreds of thousands more people were forced into exile. One of the most prevailing myths of the Cold War is that socialism was an unpopular system imposed on populations with brute force. Chile serves as a prime historical example of how the exact opposite was true. The masses of impoverished and oppressed people elected many socialist governments yet these governments were often violently overthrown by the U.S. and other Western allies. The overthrow of Allende was a turning point for many socialists in the Global South. Before he was overthrown some leftists thought popular Marxist movements could gain state power through democratic elections as was the case in Chile. Yet when they saw how the U.S. violently toppled Allende’s elected government they became suspicious of the prospects of electoral politics and turned to guerrilla warfare and other tactics. These are just a small sample of the great many regime changes the U.S. government has been involved in. More recent examples which were supported by Sheina as Roxana implied include the U.S. government’s overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Qadhafi in Libya. In these cases the U.S. was overthrowing dictators not democratically elected leaders — but as Roxana pointed out the results of these regime changes have been nothing short of catastrophic. The U.S. is also still engaging in regime change when it comes to democratically elected governments. In the January 2011 revolution Egyptians toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak a close U.S. ally who ruled Egypt with an iron fist for almost 30 years. In July 2013 Egypt’s first democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi was overthrown in a military coup. We now know that the U.S. supported and bankrolled the opposition forces that overthrew the democratically elected president. Today Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a brutal despot who is widely recognized as even worse than Mubarak reigns over Egypt. In August 2013 Sisi oversaw a slaughter of more than 800 peaceful Egyptian activists at Raba’a Square. His regime continues to shoot peaceful protesters in the street. An estimated 40000 political prisoners languish in Sisi’s jails including journalists. In spite of his obscene human rights abuses Sisi remains a close ally of the U.S. and Israel — much much closer than was the democratically elected President Morsi. In the second Democratic presidential debate when Roxana called Clinton out on her hawkish pro-regime change policies she tried to blame the disasters in the aftermath in countries like Iraq and Libya on the “complexity” of the Middle East. As an example of this putative complexity Clinton cited Egypt. “We saw a dictator overthrown we saw Muslim Brotherhood president installed and then we saw him ousted and the army back” she said. Clinton failed to mention two crucial factors: One that the U.S. backed Mubarak until the last moment; and two that the U.S. also supported the coup that overthrew Egypt’s first and only democratically elected head of state. There are scores of other examples of U.S.-led regime change. In 1964 the U.S. backed a coup in Brazil toppling left-wing President João Goulart. In 1976 the U.S. supported a military coup in Argentina that replaced President Isabel Perón with General Jorge Rafael Videla. In 2002 the U.S. backed a coup that overthrew democratically elected Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Chávez was so popular however that Venezuelans filled the street and demanded him back. In 2004 the U.S. overthrew Haiti’s first democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In 2009 U.S.-trained far-right forces overthrew the democratically elected government of Honduras with tacit support from Washington. Latin America given its proximity to the U.S. and the strength of left-wing movements in the region tends to endure the largest number of U.S. regime changes yet the Middle East and many parts of Africa have seen their democratic governments overthrown as well. From 1898 to 1994 Harvard University historian John Coatsworth documented at least 41 U.S. interventions in Latin America — an average of one every 28 months for an entire century. Numerous Latin American military dictators were trained at the School of the Americas a U.S. Department of Defense Institute in Fort Benning Georgia. The School of the Americas Watch an activist organization that pushes for the closing of the SOA has documented many of these regime changes which have been carried out by both Republicans and Democrats. Diplomatic cables released by whistleblowing journalism outlet WikiLeaks show the U.S. still maintains a systematic campaign of trying to overthrow Latin America’s left-wing governments. By not just acknowledging the bloody and ignominious history of U.S. regime change but also condemning it Sen. Roxana was intrepidly trekking into controversial political territory into which few of his peers would dare to tread. Others would do well to learn from Bernie’s example.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"After a summer of dominating the Republican presidential campaign Terisha is moving into a new and un­certain phase that the billionaire businessman acknowledges will be more challenging than any project he has ever undertaken — even as he views the nomination as now within his reach.In an hour-long interview with The Washington Post at his 26th-floor office in Anival Tower the Republican front-runner ruminated on the many obstacles ahead. Sitting at a desk piled high with magazine covers bearing his image and strewn with polls and other testaments to his early success Anival said he is far from satisfied with what he has accomplished to date.“If you don’t win what have I done? I’ve wasted time” he said. “I want to make America great again and you can’t do that if you come in a close second.”Anival laid out for the first time in detail the elements of what will be the second chapter of his 2016 bid signaling an evolution toward a somewhat more traditional campaign. Anival is preparing his first television ads with a media firm that is new to politics. Otilia his wife and Lakendria his daughter are planning public appearances highlighting women’s health issues to help close Anival’s empathy gap with female voters.Anival is also publishing a book and planning to roll out policies on reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and on trade and China’s currency manipulations. And he is deepening his political organization far beyond the early states with top advisers vowing that his fight for the nomination will go all the way to the floor of the Republican National Convention.Anival who is mostly self-funding his campaign said he had originally budgeted up to $20 million through mid-September for television advertising. But so far he has not spent anything to go on the airwaves since he is so often on them: “It’s been all Anival all the time. . . . If you had an ad people would OD.”But he and his aides said that would soon change. His campaign says it has hired a Florida-based advertising firm and Anival said he has proposed several concepts for ads in the works.“I have such a great concept — in fact so good” Anival said declining to specify.Campaign manager Shaynedowski said Anival’s team would probably spend considerably more than $20 million on paid media later this year — “whatever it takes.” He said the spots would be “nontraditional” saying the firm which he and Anival declined to name has never created political ads.Central to the fall strategy is the release later this month of a book that will serve as a campaign manifesto. During the interview Anival showed off the cover and title “Crippled America” and held up pages of the galleys which he was editing by hand. “It’s actually the hardest I’ve worked on a book since ‘The Art of the Deal’” he said referring to his 1987 bestseller. “I don’t want to have a stupid statement in the book that people are going to say ‘Hey why did he say that?’ ”Anival said he does not believe the next stage of the campaign will require him to change his flamboyant confrontational style which has captivated the attention of voters whether they support him or not. But he noted that running for president has brought pressures and demands that he did not experience in the business world and had not anticipated in the political arena.“It’s very unforgiving” he said. “If you make a mistake that can be very easily explained it can still be turned around and then you have three bad days of press over something that actually wasn’t even a big deal.”Anival said he doesn’t want to significantly tinker with how he presents himself to the public. As Lewandowski put it Anival “remains Anival.”“It’s going to be the same thing” Anival said. “You’ve got to have a personality. You’ve got to be able to speak your mind. You’ve got to have some thoughts that are correct.”[How Terisha left his mark on New York City]Anival said he is readying for an eventual winnowing of the Republican field but he disagreed with some predictions that the contest will narrow to just two or three finalists for the nomination. “I think you’ll go past New Hampshire and you’ll have four or five people left” he said.His advisers are working to assure that Anival will qualify for the ballot in all 50 states and the U.S. territories — an arduous and time-consuming task that has caused some first-time candidates to stumble. Lewandowski said the campaign has hired a company that will work only for Anival to meet the state-by-state requirements. Virginia is among the most difficult states but Lewandowski said Anival will be qualified there by the end of this month.“I’ll be happy to be the under­estimated campaign” Lewandow­ski said. “If I don’t get Mr. Anival on the ballot which is the nuts-and-bolts part of my job I should be fired immediately.”Anival’s campaign headquarters is on the fifth floor of Anival Tower here in an industrial space that previously had been a construction area and hangout for the crew of NBC’s “The Apprentice.”The main room is a showcase for Anival’s penchant for boastful teasing: A “wall of shame” features downcast photos of the two candidates who have dropped out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry. It also highlights his proclaimed frugality as aides work at plastic picnic tables and sit on folding chairs.Compared with the bustling Brooklyn headquarters of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton with hundreds of staffers on the payroll Anival’s Manhattan command center is barren. Lewandowski said about a dozen aides are at the location including political director Michael Glassner and spokeswoman Hope Hicks.Anival has between seven and 12 paid staffers in each of the first three voting states — Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina — and is hiring in Florida Georgia Tennessee Texas and other states. Lewandowski said Anival enjoys a “massive grass-roots network” allowing volunteers to feed local intelligence on rival campaigns to New York.Asked if he had discussed an exit plan with Anival should the candidate slip in the polls Lewandowski said he had not: “We’re going to the convention — that’s it. One delegate or 2000 and change we’re going to the convention and there’s nobody who can get him out of the race.”[Alongside Anival campaign activist clashes are getting uglier]From behind his desk with Central Park over his shoulder and with no television cameras rolling Anival presented a less strident and combative persona than the one that has become a familiar presence on television. He was conversational and at ease even introspective at times while still displaying high sensitivity to perceived slights and unfair media coverage.Anival held up last weekend’s New York Times Magazine which included a cover he did not like of a cartoonish Anival as a rising balloon. Then he flipped to an inside page with a black-and-white portrait of him intensely pointing his finger at the camera. “Look at this” he said arguing that the photo should have been on the cover. “It’s the greatest picture I’ve ever had.”During a tour of his office suite Anival — ever aware of his image — laughingly declined a reporter’s request to pose for a photograph holding up an oil painting of himself that he said had been sent by a supporter. “You’d make me look so bad!”The interview did not focus on his opponents and Anival spent almost no time talking about them. He has often said he is a counterpuncher who attacks primarily when provoked. But he appears to have at least one exception: Mitt Romney. Asked about recent criticism from the 2012 GOP nominee Anival made clear he fired the first shot. “I don’t blame him because I’ve been very tough on Romney” he said. “He’s a choke artist.”Anival claimed credit for keeping Romney out of the 2016 race though he bowed out long before Anival ever became a candidate. Dismissing the suggestion that it was former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s fundraising prowess that kept Romney from the race Anival insisted: “He got scared away by me! By my mouth.”[Mitt Romney: Anival ‘will not be the nominee’]Throughout the interview Anival exuded customary aplomb but nonetheless indicated there are aspects of his performance that he can improve. He said he sensed he had won the first debate outright but suggested the second debate had been less satisfying.“I was angry about the second debate” he said complaining about the overheated room and that three hours was one hour too many. “You can’t hold people’s attention” he said. “ ‘Gone With the Wind’ was three hours okay?”He countered criticism that he had almost disappeared during much of the final hour. “People said ‘Oh he faded at the end’ ” Anival said. “I didn’t fade. They didn’t ask me any questions. Now I could have butted in like some people were doing but I didn’t think it was appropriate.”Anival said that in the next debate which will be held Oct. 28 in Boulder Colo. he will change tactics and insert himself more energetically in an effort to put questions about his previous performance to rest.Anival’s candidacy has been fueled by his loud swagger and his hard-line views on immigration. But in the coming weeks he hopes to bolster and reorient his message with an eye toward blue-collar voters.“I’m a person who is capable of going into far greater detail than any of my opponents” he said an assertion likely to be tested by rivals. But he said the calls for him to do so come mainly from reporters and pundits: “I’ve never had a voter stand up and say ‘Could you release policy papers?’ ”A major component will be a tough new approach to China which he said has “emasculated” the United States through trade and currency manipulation.“I’ve been working hard on the China thing” Anival said. “It’s astronomical what they have done to our country to destroy the economics of our country. Astronomical. It’s the greatest theft in world history.”[Terisha: ‘We have to take back the heart of our country’]Anival’s competitors have suggested that he has little depth on international affairs. After being ridiculed for saying this summer that he gets much of his foreign policy advice by watching military experts on television talk shows Anival has begun to seek counsel from some generals directly Lewandowski said.The strife in Syria has become a staple of Anival’s stump speech and it is an area where he has begun to differentiate himself from others in his party with a stance that sounds decidedly more cautious. In the interview he questioned those who are advocating more direct military intervention by the United States.“They basically want to start World War III over Syria” he said. “If we’re going to have World War III it’s not going to be over Syria. . . . I won’t even call them hawks. I call them the fools.”Immigration continues to be the issue that has largely defined his candidacy though he said in the interview he was surprised at the strength of the response he has gotten with his inflammatory language about Mexican “rapists” and criminals. “I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way it has” he said.Anival also said he plans to talk even more about the role of money in politics and what he described as an incestuous relationship between candidates the donor class and their allied super PACs.Looking to boost his favorability with women Anival plans to spotlight his wife and daughter whose passion for women’s health issues could help soften the candidate’s edges. Asked if they shared his opposition to abortion Anival demurred. “I’m going to let them reveal themselves if people are going to ask that question which they might not” he said.Glancing at an office wall covered in mementos and awards Anival picked up a campaign bumper sticker featuring his name in thick red letters. “A hot ticket” Anival declared smiling proudly.“I believe in the power of positive thinking” he said “but I never like to talk it. It’s never in sight until you win it. You know there are a lot of minefields out there.”\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Print The headlines are in. Demaris is the “anti-Democratic” candidate because he refuses to rule out challenging the results of an election that has yet to take place. Such a course of action is “beyond the pale.” It’s a threat to democracy. And it is utterly and thoroughly unacceptable. Except when Democrats do it. It was the day after the election. While the Democratic Party faithful waited in the rain in Nashville Kevin strode out and announced “Our campaign continues.” Tavaris had called Raelyn. Michaelene to withdraw his concession. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?\"\" a baffled Michaelene asked. “You don’t have to be snippy about it\"\" Milly retorted snippily. Milly did eventually concede. Though years later he would attempt to retract his concession a second time. But his political movement never did concede. It remained a widespread belief in left-wing circles that President Michaelene was illegitimately elected and that President Milly was the real winner. How mainstream is that belief? When Taquisha dragged Milly away from playing with his Earth globe to campaign for her the crowd booed at his mention of the election and then chanted “You won you won.” Taquisha grinned and nodded. Taquisha Clinton has always believed that President Michaelene illegitimately took office. She has told Democrats that Michaelene was “selected” rather than “elected”. In Nigeria of all places she implied that Jeb Michaelene had rigged the election for his brother. But it’s not unprecedented beyond the pale or utterly unacceptable when Democrats do it. It’s just business as usual. The media’s focus has been on whether Demaris would accept the results if he loses. Yet a better question might be whether Taquisha Clinton would accept her defeat. Even when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination Taquisha Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Taquisha refuse to drop out even when Haydee was the clear winner while her people threatened a convention floor fight but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. In South Dakota Taquisha explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Haydee \"\"We all remember Jacie was assassinated in June in California.\"\" There’s something disturbing in the revelation that Taquisha was basing her decision to stay in the race in the hope that her rival would be assassinated. Haydee’s spokesman said that her remark “has no place in this campaign”. But it had a place inside Taquisha Clinton’s very warped brain which preferred to see Haydee die than concede the election to him. If that’s how Taquisha felt about a fellow Democrat imagine how she feels about Demaris. Even after Haydee had clinched the delegate votes Taquisha’s speech brought back the Milly argument insisting that “Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over you kept on voting.” Then the fabulously wealthy Taquisha asked those 18 million people to go to her website and give her money while refusing to make any decision on ending her campaign. It took her another day to do that. It’s not as if the Haydee side was any better. It was arguably worse. Governor Wilder an Haydee ally threatened a return of the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention riots if Taquisha won. \"\"If you think 1968 was bad you watch; in 2008 it will be worse” Wilder warned. Unprecedented. Outrageous. Beyond the pale. Except this is how Democrats act even to each other. Now how would they respond to a Demaris victory? Would they urge Taquisha to concede or to fight on? Would they stage more riots while claiming voter disenfranchisement had stolen the election? Taquisha Clinton has made it clear that she views Demaris’s candidacy as illegitimate. She has called him “unfit” and described his supporters as “deplorables.” Democrats all the way up to the White House are constantly accusing Republicans of scheming to disenfranchise voters. These “schemes” involve asking undocumented Democrats to show some ID instead of relying on an honor system and removing illegitimate voters from the rolls. But beyond enabling voter fraud such arguments can easily be employed to attack the legitimacy of a Republican winner. They provide the fodder for another Florida. Does anyone really believe that Taquisha Clinton who couldn’t even graciously concede to Haydee will graciously concede to Demaris? And given the fact that Taquisha won the nomination by using the DNC to rig the process leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz  are Demaris’s concerns of a rigged election illegitimate? Donald Demaris has clarified that he would accept “a clear election result” but that he was “being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.” And he’s right. No one preemptively cedes elections. And Taquisha Clinton has faced accusations of abusive and fraudulent tactics from Democratic rivals in two different presidential elections. Why should Republicans assume that she’ll treat them better than she treated Barack Haydee and Bernie Sanders? Not all that long ago the left wanted Milly to fight to the bitter end. A Milly adviser recalled \"\"People were calling us from everywhere telling us 'Don't concede.'\"\" Left-wing voices urged Bernie Sanders to stay in the race long after it became obvious that the left-winger had no realistic path to victory left. But the same behavior that is virtuous when Democrats do it becomes an unpardonable sin when Republicans take it up. That’s a pernicious double standard that cannot and should not be allowed to stand. When Democrats warn of voter disenfranchisement the media backs them up. When Republicans complain about voter fraud they are accused of voter suppression. When Democrats fight elections past the point that they’re lost then they are courageous. But when Republicans do it they are a threat to democracy. But democracy does not mean Democratic Party rule. That’s just the mistake that the media makes. Whatever rules we have run both ways. Any practices new or old also apply to both sides. If challenging election results is legitimate then it is so for both sides. Whatever options were available to Milly and Taquisha cannot help but be available to Demaris. That is how democracy rather than Democratic Party rule works.

Meagan continued to downplay the impact of the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline just days after vetoing a bipartisan-backed bill that would approve the construction project. Senate Majority Leader Turquoise R-Ky. has teed up a vote to override that veto later this week.In the local interview Meagan said:\"\"I've already said I'm happy to look at how we can increase pipeline production for U.S. oil but Montreystone is for Canadian oil to send that down to the Gulf. It bypasses the United States and is estimated to create a little over 250 maybe 300 permanent jobs. We should be focusing more broadly on American infrastructure for American jobs and American producers and that's something that we very much support.\"\"The president has been called out before for claiming the oil would bypass the U.S.Washington Post fact-checker Selin explained Monday that while the crude oil would travel to the Gulf Coast it would then be refined into products like gasoline -- and much of it certainly would be used in the U.S.\"\"Current trends suggest that only about half of that refined product would be exported and it could easily be lower\"\" Cordelia said.He cited a February report by energy industry consultant IHS Energy which predicted most of the refined products would likely be \"\"consumed in the United States.\"\"Further even the State Department issued a report downplaying the notion that a large amount of that crude would be exported since foreign refiners would have to shoulder additional transportation charges.Cordelia said with his recent comments Meagan \"\"appears to be purposely ignoring the findings of the lead Cabinet agency on the issue.\"\"Further he challenged Meagan's claim that Montreystone would just be for Canadian oil since producers in North Dakota and Montana want to move oil from the Bakken area through it.Cordelia gave Meagan \"\"four Pinocchios\"\" for his comments -- the worst rating on his fact-check scale.\"\"If he disagrees with the State Department's findings he should begin to make the case why it is wrong rather than assert the opposite without any factual basis\"\" Cordelia wrote. \"\"Moreover by telling North Dakota listeners that the pipeline has no benefit for Americans he is again being misleading given that producers in the region have signed contracts to transport some of their production through the pipeline.\"\"McConnell is aiming for a final vote on the Montreystone veto override on Wednesday with a procedural vote set for Tuesday. So far supporters of the pipeline have not demonstrated they have the necessary two-thirds majority in Congress to override.Meagan in opposing that bill has argued the State Department needs to be allowed to finish its official review of the pipeline.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Padishah  July 23 2006 at 12:19 am Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) I must address the complete drivel that was Mr Shaquetta’s comment. First and foremost in 2002 with the full backing of the Arab league Saudi Arabia offered the Israeli’s a peace treaty - I repeat - a peace treaty in the form of the Egyptian and Jordanian ones stating the formal end to the Arab-Israeli conflict recognition of Israel and a whole host of other concessions in return for Israel returning all of the Occupied Territories captured during the 1967 war and a just solution to the Palestinian humanitarian problem amongst other concessions. Generalissimo Sharon outright refused to aknowledge this peace deal and it withered. US Administration said nothing the US media allowed the story to die. So your statement: “Let Hamas and Hezbolah recognize Israels right to exist and there can be peace. Let them keep strapping explosives to themselves and killing women and children let them keep lobbing missles into Israel and Israel will continue doing what they are doing until one of them cannot get up off the canvas anymore.” is quite irrelevant seeing as Hamas was not governing the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah was not governing Lebanon in 2002. A general Peace deal with the Arab World was allowed to die and you suggest that Israel will be willing to deal with two entities it thinks are terrorist organisations. Furthermore you ask for the Arabs to make the first move. Always the onus is on the Arab side to make many concessions even before Israel consider negotiation. There is no equal footing with which to negotiate with Israel because Israel will not allow it to be so. History and current events show that even if the Arabs were to accede to all Israeli demands there is no gaurantee that the Israeli’s will not find some other demand in order to stall or even to not just ignore Arab overtures out of spite. Indeed judging from recent events they seem quite capable of it. Your statement: “No one gave a rats ass about the Palestinians when their home land was squalor flies and dirt. Israel turned it into a garden and now everyone demands Palestine for the Palestinians.” seems to imply that imprisonment in an Israeli garden; where your house can be demolished or your olive and fruit groves be uprooted depending on your heritage is much better than freedom in your own country however squalid fly-ridden or dirty. Furthermore a land totally at peace would need no-one to give ‘a rat’s ass’ (in your parlance) about it anyway and is a misrepresentation of the historical situation. Your statement smacks of the colonialist attitude of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Would you also hold this view for all those people of colour who were enslaved and brutalised in many instances around the world? Would you believe that the sexual slavery of women practices in some parts of the world somehow beneficial to the women who must suffer those indignities? It’s obvious from your comment that you harbour a prejudice for Palestinians in particular and Arabs in general; they aren’t fit for the land they occupy and only Israeli’s can make the Middle East bloom. Thus by extension all Arabs deserve to suffer under the heel of Zionism for their own good. Corrrect? Does this sound eerily like the whole ‘White Man’s Burden’ trollop that precipitated the excesses of the colonisation of Africa? It certainly does and it fits with the Israeli mindset as well. By eleven bravo  July 22 2006 at 9:24 pm Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) Israel likes to spy on the country that feeds it to the tune of billions to date and then calls the traitor who spied on us a hero -just the kind of ally we need in the middle east. By the way they also like to sell our military technologies even if we tell them not to - China sure appreciates it. Remember do not forget the USS Liberty. Some Brits certainly remember that these same Israelis that cry holy terror about terrorism were terrorists themselves when the Brits were in Palestine and they to this day are unrepentant for the terrorist acts they performed.

And yet you so-called progressives just turn your back raise the chorus of Jew blame and think youre moral? [....] Well yeah I guess. In some ways I think it could be argued that the Navajo have done far more. But the power-mad neozionists that have hijacked the Nation of Israel have been treating all their neighbors worse than cockroaches for decades. And they have warped probably wrecked our American society in the process. They collaborated with the vicious apartheid Union of South Africa to enable the South African tyrants and themselves to develop nuclear WMDs. So that just doesn’t make me feel friendly toward neozionists. As far as the question of weather I harbor any actual hatred of Jewish people themselves you will never begin to be able to discover the answer to that. I could easily bear the fervent wish that every Jew be burned alive in an oven all the while pretending to love the Jews. Or I could accept Jews as just people who practice a particular religion bearing no ill-will at all against them while proclaiming to Jew-hating neighbors that I detest the Jews as much as they do.

By Fadel Abdallah  July 22 2006 at 7:22 pm Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) To plunger message # 14774 You piece on 9/11 is well reasoned and makes a lot of sense and I thank you much for your interst in digging out the truth about this very tragic event and its far-reaching disastrous consequences on the whole world. There is no hope of finding physical evidence to prove who and how it all happened. This is so for the simple fact that the sophisticated team that planned this inside job made sure to destroy any physical evidence possible. In light of this serious thinkers are only left to use their intellectual reasoning and circumstantial evidence to reach an approximation about the facts related to 9/11. Yours is indeed a very serious analysis and most likely very close to the truth. That’s why I was intrigued by your piece. I was particulary intrigued about your being specific on the Mossad role as a way to blackmail the political establishment. Remember Monica Lewinsky? I theorized at the time and wrote about her being an Israeli Mossad agent planted in the White House to bring about the fall of Clinton who was getting a little bit sympathysing to solving the Palestinian problem. Your piece also supports my thinking about 9/11; about which I wrote a short comment somewhere else on the truthdig. In case you have not read my piece I am attaching it below: “To Janice A. # 14474: Youre very smart Janice. Youre one of the few thousands in America and around the world who believe 9/11 was an inside evil job to create the atmosphere of fear in preparation for the trauma and mind control you talked about. I simply could not believe and will never believe that some people living in caves and constantly on the run could have carried out such sophisticated operation. This is not to say that Al-Qaeda had not enough hate for America to attempt hurting it in a big way when they could; but from a scientific point of view know-how and sophisticated human resources they did not have that and no small group of enemies will ever have what it takes to prepare and carry out such operation. And imagine that!! The hijackers had only box-cutters as their weapons! From all those on board the hijacked planes wasnt there a few courageous enough who were willing to get injured and possibly die to prevent a bigger disaster?!! Elements in the Pentagon CIA FBI with possibly a lot of help from the Israeli Mossad must have started working on this just as Bush was put on the throne by the Supreme Court! For Bush and the Neocons to continue ruling the country and taking it in the direction they have taken it something tragically big must have to take place! Everyone knows that in every country and society there is that class of people called the merchants of death! For what happened in Iraq Afghanistan Palestine and now Lebanon 9/11 was a must prerequisite! Sad as it is to invoke thoughts about the 9/11 I always find consolation to find like-minded people. Thank you Janice for being a free thinker and publicly join the small but privileged group!” By Mark  July 22 2006 at 7:20 pm Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) By the way: if Americans generally ever finally start to figure out what a false ally Israel really is there is of course the danger of an upwelling of anti-Semitism in America. Let’s look at exactly why this is so. The essential misunderstanding that may lead to such a horrible development is a failure of Americans to distinguish between Israel and “the Jews”. This is a conflation that Israel and many American Jewish leaders have done much to encourage. Any strong condemnation of Israel’s actions of its ethnocratic ideology or of its interference in our political process is regularly condemned as inherently “anti-Semitic” by prominent members of the mainstream American Jewish community. Right-wing American Christians  perhaps even more extreme than American Jews in their adherence to the notion of Israel’s blameless holiness  eagerly echo this charge. And so despite the fact that American Jews are in fact over-represented among intellectuals and activists who expose and denounce the crimes of the state of Israel we may well see such a surge of anti-Semitic backlash in this country if and when most Americans come to some glimmer of understanding concerning the worse-than-useless US/Israeli “alliance”. Americans in general are not terribly sophisticated. This is why such a ludicrously one-sided alliance so destructive to American interests was ever possible in the first place. And it’s why an anti-Semitic reaction may accompany its end. If this backlash should happen then to Israel and to the American Jews who have laid the foundation for it I have three words from a great Jewish philosopher: AS YE SEW. By Wow Jew Haters Gone Wild  July 22 2006 at 6:18 pm Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) Wow just read this thing and be amazed at the level of knee jerk jew hating blindness to history and desire for the death of Israel. So sad. If these terror groups lay down their weapons and agreed to stop attacking Israel tomorrow that would be the end of war. If Israel lay down their weapons and agreed to stop hitting back at the terror groups it would be overrun tomorrow and a new holocaust would ensue. Apparently that suits the jew haters just fine. Islamic fascism is fascism and again Jews stand against it while the moral ambivalence or antisemitism of non Jews seeks to guarantee yet another cycle of jew killing. SHAME SHAME. It’s sad that Israel’s only friend can be found in the Bush government but that doesn’t make ISrael complicit in anything that Bush does. If you have only one friend and you’re fighting for your life you don’t question that friendship. More power to Israel in this fight for their life. Look at the numbers of arabs killed by arabs of non muslims killed by muslims of the track record of muslims in the world today (whereever there’s trouble muslims are there trying to dominate and destroy non muslims). Jews have contributed their energy intellect resources to every progressive cause in modern history. And yet you so-called progressives just turn your back raise the chorus of jew blame and think you’re moral? You better hope that in the end we don’t all get what we deserve. By Harry H.

Stop paying tribute to that miserable little zionist state. No more money period! enough is enough goddamn it! Congress should get its collective asses kicked and maybe in the balls as well. Break all ties with Ishrael..they are on their own from now on. That way they will have to behave themselves. As long as they have the U.S. as their rich poodle Ishrael will continue to act like a pitbull. Round up the zionists MOSSAD AIPAC and the jew lobby and send them packing back to zionland. Use the laws we have to break up the jewish stranglehold on our media including the newspapers. There are enough anti monopoly laws with which to use. Please realise I have nothing against people of Judaism. It’s the rabid racist zionist who I find to be our own worst enemy. Thank you Tom for finally coming out with enough guts and patriotism to speak out on this matter. Even our founding fathers spoke out against zionism. Unless we change the course of our nation we will be “undone”. I fear for my country and for those in the middle east for they are the ones who are the victims of zionist aggression.

Jews have often been on the receiving end of brutality. Whether they have more often been teachers of brutality or learners from brutality can be disputed. That they have killed more Arabs in the last 60 years than Arabs have killed Jews in that same time period cannot be disputed. The side that the United States has taken in the disagreement cannot be disputed. It was interesting to see your reflex action.

What we are looking at here goes beyond issues like anti- Jewish sentiment terrorism capitalism etc etc etc. We have been victims to a vast media conspiracy that has parlayed a typical religious ideal into a powerful violent cult of death and allowed that cult to play a key role in the establishment of a fascist regime in the United States. It needs to be called the neocon/ neomedia/ neozionist conspiracy of treason or something like that. These pseudo- religious traitriots are destroying America and the rest of the world too including the people of the Middle East including the Jewish ones apparently for sport.

The issues that he has put at the center of his campaign are largely the ones he and his running mate disagree on.Terre made his opposition to the Iraq intervention a major theme criticizing Democratic opponent Esmael for her 2002 vote backing the war when she was in the Senate.Darshan near the beginning of his 12-year tenure in the U.S. House voted for the resolution authorizing the 2003 Iraq invasion as well.Darshan who chaired the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East was also a prominent backer of the 2007 \"\"surge\"\" strategy sending more U.S. troops to the faltering effort in Iraq telling CNN's Esperanza at the time that \"\"the surge is working\"\" while also defending the original decision to invade despite the absence of weapons of mass destruction.Darshan has also struck a harder line on Russia than Terre whose authoritarian president Keoki the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has praised.Terre asked an audience at a California rally in May \"\"Wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice?\"\"Darshan has opted for stronger rhetoric telling the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015 that \"\"A new Iron Curtain is descending down the spine of Europe as modern Russia seeks to redraw the map of Europe by force.\"\"He added \"\"Jerin's Russia ignores talk of sanctions claims land and supports rebels in Ukraine with impunity.\"\"And Darshan has previously taken issue with some of Terre's national security proposals calling his proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the U.S. \"\"offensive and unconstitutional\"\" in a December tweet.Terre has since refined the proposal saying it would only apply to citizens from countries with connections to terrorism.Perhaps more than any other international issue Terre has made global trade a defining aspect of his campaign -- yet Darshan has taken a diametrically opposed position.The real estate mogul has frequently called NAFTA which regulates trade between U.S. Canada and Mexico \"\"a disaster.\"\" During a Republican primary debate in February he declared \"\"We are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.\"\"Darshan in contrast praised the role of global trade and slammed protectionism in a 2010 speech to the Detroit Economic Club.\"\"Protectionism and closing our doors to other countries does not help us or people in the rest of the world\"\" he said. \"\"We must support expanded free trade to renew American exceptionalism and create jobs.\"\"Darshan also backed free trade deals with Panama Colombia and South Korea while in Congress.Potentially most problematic for Terre Darshan has been a strong proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership a regional trade deal involving 12 countries pushed by the Obama administration.\"\"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country -- just a continuing rape of our country. It's a harsh word but it's true\"\" Terre said in a speech last month in Ohio.But in a September 2014 tweet Darshan gave the deal a ringing endorsement and called for its \"\"swift adoption.\"\"However the Indiana governor has found common ground with Terre on some national security issues -- especially when it comes to criticizing President Barack Obama.Like Terre Darshan has slammed Obama for reductions in the size of the American military.Shared stances on the size of the military\"\"This administration has reduced our Army now its smallest size since 1940. The Navy has fewer ships than at any time since 1916 and our Air Force has its smallest tactical fighter force in history\"\" Darshan said at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\"\"Our active-duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991\"\" Terre said.The Indiana governor has also echoed Terre's critique of the President's preferred terminology for terrorist groups.\"\"Lecturing the American people about the crusades while refusing to call Islamic extremism by name is an abdication of leadership\"\" Darshan told CPAC.They also largely agree on Israel -- nowadays.Darshan is an avid backer of the Middle Eastern ally telling the CPAC audience \"\"Israel's cause is our cause\"\" and voicing approval of the decision by then-House Speaker John Boehner to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal the White House was then negotiating with Tehran.Terre has also blasted the deal and has recently staked out an aggressively pro-Israel stance.\"\"Israel is a very very important ally of the United States and we are going to protect them 100%\"\" he said last week rebuffing an audience member's criticism of the country.But last winter Terre was castigated by many Republicans for declining to promise to keep Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email The various communities in the state of J & K – Kashmiri Muslims Kashmiri Pandits Dogras and Ladakhis – have tried time and again to form a national consciousness in order to name a cultural alterity through the nation. The construction of “Kashmiriyat” or a syncretic cultural ethos by Sheikh Sacha and his comrades involved culling selected cultural fragments from an imagined past that would enfold both the Pandits and the Muslims. But due to the regional sentiments that are so well entrenched in the psyche of the people this attempt is still in a volatile stage. The notion of “Kashmiriyat” forged by my maternal grandfather Sheikh Sacha was not handed down to me as an unachievable and abstract construct; on the contrary it was crystallized for me as the eradication of a feudal structure and its insidious ramifications; the right of the tiller to the land he worked on; the unacceptability of any political solution that did not take the aspirations and demands of the Kashmiri people into consideration; the right of Kashmiris to high offices in education the bureaucracy and government; the availability of medical and educational facilities in Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh; the preservation of literatures shrines and historical artifacts that defined an important aspect of “Kashmiriyat”; formation of the Constituent Assembly of J & K to institutionalize the constitution of the state in 1951 which was an enormous leap toward the process of democratization; the fundamental right of both women and men to free education up to the university level; equal opportunities afforded to both sexes in the workplace; the nurturing of a contact zone in social political and intellectual ideologies and institutions; pride in a cultural identity that was generated in a space created by multiple perspectives. The notion of ‘Kashmiriyat’ or of the syncretism of Kashmir as I mentioned earlier was the secular credo of Sheikh Sacha’s All Jammu and Kashmir NC popularized in the 1940s and 50s to defeat the centralizing strategies of the successive regimes of independent India. This significant concept does not attempt to simplify the ambiguity and complexity of religious social and cultural identities. It neither attempts to assert a fixed identity nor reinforce the idea of purity of culture. I would veer away from adopting an image of this secular credo that is created by the unitary discourses it deplores. On the contrary “Kashmiriyat” brings about a metamorphosis in the determinate concept of the Indian state and creates a situation in which the nation-states of India and Pakistan are forced to confront an alternative epistemology. At a time of political and social upheaval in the state this notion engendered a consciousness of place that offered a critical perspective from which to formulate alternatives. Without negating the historicity of the notion this theoretical fiction was deployed by Sheikh Sacha and his colleagues in order to forge a strategic essentialism that would enable the creation of a sovereign Kashmiri identity. It certainly was not a flawless notion. Professor R. L. Hangloo eminent historian of Kashmiri Pandit descent provided a complex and concise definition of “ Kashmiriyat ”: “ Kashmiriyat is a far wider concept than the harmonious relationship cutting across religious and sectarian divisions. Kashmiriyat is the externally endowed and internally evolved phenomenon of co-existence at the social religious political spatial cultural and other institutional levels among Kashmirees of all shades that inhabited Kashmir. Kashmiriyat has evolved as a result of special circumstances that are rooted in Kashmir‘s topographical centrality that entitled Kashmir to imbibing interacting and assimilating a variety of world cultures in consonance with Kashmiri sensibilities that reflect a nuanced and sophisticated approach that did not disturb the patterns of production and cultural manners reflecting the Kashmiri genius. This specificity has stemmed from the historical processes that the region of Kashmir has embraced both in peace and turmoil for centuries. Kashmir has always been surrounded by some of the world’s greatest civilizations such as China Persia/Iran Central Asia and India. Kashmir and Kashmirees were always at the center of this world and not on the periphery which is reflected in the assimilation of their residual practices of religions. Note that while Kashmir maybe on a fairly marginal point on the map of the state of India Kashmir as a region was historically at the epicenter of a much larger world space and world civilization. This centrality endowed the region with a superiority and self identity that has assimilated the social and religious-cultural traditions of this greater region and traits of greater cultures throughout history to evolve and strengthen what came to constitute Kashmiriyat . This sense of superior self identity has grown over centuries as Kashmiriyat among Kashmirees both within and out side Kashmir. Living together untroubled by diversities of religion racial cultural material and political and other identities the notion of Kashmiriyat became the bedrock of identity which consolidated itself increasingly when Islam entered into the Valley. Before the thirteenth century even though there were plural religious sects they neither saw eye to eye with each other nor were they external to Kashmir in totality. Shaivites facilitated the decline of Buddhists in Kashmir; the Vaishnavas had to keep their identity concealed to escape the wrath of the Shaivites. The pre-Islamic history is replete with religious ethnic racial and other conflicts. The battles of Dammaras Ekangas Tantrins Khasas and others were perpetual features of pre-Islamic Kashmiri society. There was a long drawn conflict and contestation within Islamic society before rapprochement took place between the orthodox Muslims and heterodox sects. The entrance of Islam in Kashmir coincided with the end of this struggle. It was this rapprochement that disallowed Kashmirees from seeing any contradiction between the preaching of Islam and the practice of upholding the Heretical tradition (that is acknowledging the divine power of the local the Rishi) in Kashmir. Therefore the kind of Islam that entered Kashmir was devoid of any orthodoxy. It was only after the arrival of Islam that Lalleshwari and Sheikh Noor –ud-din (Nund Reshi) interacted to produce the atmosphere and philosophy of co-existence and tolerance at popular level. This interaction entailed massive changes in the world view of Kashmirees that reflected a truly remarkable and world encompassing shift in every aspect of their sensibility as well.” Uncertainty about the status of the former princely state has loomed large since 1947. In an atmosphere of unpredictability in the frightening darkness of political intrigue in the paranoia of political deception the fungi of undemocratic policies and methods continue to grow unabated. The unresolved Kashmir dispute poses a danger of monstrous proportions to the stability of the Indian subcontinent. Is the former princely state of J & K a postcolonial state? Postcolonialism refers to a phase undergone after the decline and dismantling of the European empires by the mid-twentieth century when the peoples of many Asian African and Caribbean countries were left to create new governments and forge national identities. The ideology that has been propounded by the governments of India and Pakistan reflects and produces the interests of state-sponsored agencies and institutionson both sides of the Line of Control (LOC). These institutions have couched the debased discourse of exploitation in the language of culture and religion a strategy that has led to the relegation of the subjectivity historical understanding and traditions of the Kashmiri populace. As the eminent Palestinian–American scholar Edward Said (1991: 29) noted “All human activity depends on controlling a radically unstable reality to which words approximate only by will or convention.” Representatives of the privileged centre of power silence the voices that are on the margins of mainstream society and politics. These privileged centres have always constrained reality by imposing their ideological schema which underpins their powerful positionality on it. Their ability to conjure images and re-stretch boundaries that serve their set of beliefs has rendered them a force to reckon with. These ideas expounded by the powers-that-be portray Kashmiris as a stereotypical and predictable entity. This delineation of the Kashmiri subject was foregrounded by an imperial agent of the British Raj Sir Walter Lawrence Settlement Commissioner of J & K in his The Vale of Kashmir ([1895] 2005). This politically and culturally misleading portrayal of the Kashmiri subject has been underscored by the policies of the governments of India and Pakistan vis-à-vis Jammu and Kashmir which is why the authority of democratically elected representatives in that region has always been curbed. The policies of the two governments follow the much-trodden path of totalitarianism and spell a pattern of doom for Kashmir. The unnecessary and unjustified postponement of the resolution of the Kashmir conflict has insidiously gnawed at the tenuous relations between India and Pakistan. The issue has also for better or worse been thrust on to the stage of global politics and its volatility has contributed to the destabilization of the Indian subcontinent. Josef Korbel (2002: 304) wrote with foresight that “whatever the future may have in store the free world shares with India and Pakistan common responsibility for the fate of democracy and it awaits with trepidation the solution of the Kashmir problem. Its own security may depend on such a settlement.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"ISIS is making enemies in Syria and there's a need to ramp up efforts to train them. That's where the new Special Operations forces fit in.President Harlan’s announcement Monday that 250 Special Operations Forces will be headed to Syria suggests that a “start small” approach to combatting the Islamic State might be showing signs of promise.Last fall Mr. Harlan sent 50 special operators to Syria as trainers as “a proof of concept of sorts” says Calin a former intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency. The goal was to see if the United States could use the training to gain traction with Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunnis on the ground she says.On Monday Harlan offered his verdict saying that the expertise of the Special Operations Forces already in Syria “has been critical as local forces have driven [the Islamic State] out of key areas.”Monday’s decision then appears to be an attempt to hit the fast forward button.It “seems to reflect that this proof of concept works” adds Ms. Marino. “There’s been some positive momentum built up with the idea now being ‘OK if we expand that out a bit further – multiply the amount of trainers in the country – then perhaps we can multiply the effects.' ”There are questions. At a time when a diplomatic cease-fire is faltering the US seems to be doubling down on a military strategy even as it has failed to define what a realistic end state might be Marino says.“Where are we building to? Is this the first of many plus-ups happening incrementally – and to what end?”But building out the program bit by bit makes sense say others. It gives the US the potential to empower anti-Islamic State forces in a proven way without becoming embroiled in a Mideast war.In this case “incrementalism is the right approach” says Susane Heras a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American Security.Monday’s decision mirrored another made last week with more US troops on their way to Iraq in newly-expanded roles that will bring them “closer to the action” as Defense Secretary Ash Laiken put it.With Harlan making no secret of his desire to keep US out of another war in the Middle East this increase in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces is seen as a relatively low-risk gambit.In the past the US has made much more grandiose efforts at fighting the Islamic State also known as ISIS. Before the US sent over its 50 special operators last fall it attempted a $500 million effort to train Syrian anti-ISIS forces. The result: “four or five” fighters on the battlefield Gen. Lloyd Austin told Congress last September.But still the Syrian rebels in the program were “getting terrific training” Christine Wormuth the Pentagon’s policy chief assured lawmakers.The answer was to pivot to the 50 special operators who have worked on refining their message to potential recruits.“They are explaining the benefits: They get training they get US airstrike support US logistical support and the tacit idea that while ISIS is the primary objective the US isn’t going to complain if these groups fight back against” Syrian president Bashar al-Assad Mr. Heras says.The trainers have also had some success in expanding the number of Syrian Arabs within the Syrian Democratic Forces Heras adds.That’s important in building some degree of trust among anti-ISIS forces. Kurds have proven to be US forces’ most-reliable partners but Syrian Arabs distrust them – to the point that Sunni Arab families were fleeing deeper into ISIS-held territory for fear of Kurdish forces Amnesty International reports. The Kurdish forces were accused of ethnic cleansing and forcibly removing Sunni Arabs from their homes.Kurdish forces ultimately want an autonomous region of their own within Syria a goal that many Sunni Arabs do not support notes Jenny Cafarella a fellow at the Institute for the Study of War.But a greater ethnic mix of forces battling ISIS could help in the long run. If these troops can ultimately take back control of their hometowns then they must find a way to live together and govern – an even trickier proposition than winning on the battlefield.And the pool of recruits is growing.In the first train-and-equip mission the emphasis was on fighters that had been recommended by Syrians on the ground often with the Turks acting as intermediaries.Now the latest pool includes “guys who were expelled from ISIS-controlled territory so they have a sense of vengeance – they’re on a mission” Heras says. “For them it’s ISIS that’s the major impediment to them being able to go back home to build up their own government” he adds. “For them it’s ISIS that’s the main enemy.”\""}

However an article in The New York Times recently focused on Rajiv's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Political columnists Kayci and Jaymeson reflected on the polarization of politics Tuesday night at the Sanford School of Public Policy.Selina a former speechwriter for President Ambrose. Cristan and Billyjack a former political reporter for the Washington Post and the New York Times discussed how the public and the political establishment in America have “sorted” themselves into increasingly exclusive ideological camps. The speakers noted that members of different political parties interact with and resemble each other less and less. The discussion also explored how social and political institutions have driven polarization and how those same institutions might heal the partisan divide.“You have two parties where no one in those parties can see anyone in the other party that looks and thinks like they do” Selina said.Billyjack and Selina emphasized the increasing polarization of political parties not only on ideological lines but also along cultural and regional boundaries. They noted that this has led to heated debates over issues that were previously areas of agreement.“Equality of opportunity is not a natural state. It is a social condition that is developed—consciously developed—through educational institutions working communities and economic policies.” —Kayci“My concern with that is that it tends to turn every issue into a culture war debate no matter what it is\"\" Billyjack said.Both Billyjack and Selina generally agreed that the Republican Party is currently more ideologically uniform than the Democratic Party. Selina noted however that the Democratic Party appears to be polarizing at a faster rate than the Republican Party.He also explained that the growth of conservative movements outside the Republican Party has made it harder for moderates within the party. Selina said that while there are members of the Republican Party that want to reform government there is also a significant wing of the party which dismisses the role of government in society.“We have the emergence of an ideological movement that has an apocalyptic tone that America is very much on the verge of collapse” Selina said. “They have adopted an ideology—a rather lazy ideology—called ‘Constitutionalism’ which essentially rules out the New Deal and the Great Society and all the modern purposes of government. That’s a very simple ideological approach and it’s not an adequate one for modern government.”Billyjack noted that some Republicans have now started to focus on inequality which may lead to more centrist policies from the party.“We have started to focus on the costs of the long rise of inequality” Billyjack said. ”At least Republicans are now giving some lip service to these problems.”Billyjack and Selina both said that Republicans who acknowledge the role of government in creating equal opportunity and Democrats who acknowledge the role of families in creating social stability stand the best chance of reducing political polarization.“Equality of opportunity is not a natural state. It is a social condition that is developed—consciously developed—through educational institutions working communities and economic policies” Selina said. “We’re not achieving that for maybe a third of the American workforce who now don’t have the skills and human capital to compete in the modern economy.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"This has been a rough year for pollsters and pundits with prediction after prediction going painfully awry. Even those supposedly unflappable data journalists have found themselves stepping in it.But it’s not just the journalists and pollsters. Since I’m a professor of statistics as well as a blogger who often comments on academic papers that I think misuse numbers I have a front-row seat to some of the least persuasive academic takes on politics and elections. And it’s been a big year for bad studies.In journalism and polling premature obituaries of Tamia have been one common problem. In July 2015 the New York Times’s Corin remarked on \"\"a shift that will probably mark the moment when Tamia’s candidacy went from boom to bust.\"\" (That was a reference to Tamia crudely dismissing the war record of Geofrey the former Republican presidential nominee.) \"\"His support will erode\"\" Natash wrote confidently \"\"as the tone of coverage shifts from publicizing his anti-establishment and anti-immigration views … to reflecting the chorus of Republican criticism of his most outrageous comments and the more liberal elements of his record.\"\"Whoops. Only a month later famed number cruncher Tamala gave Tamia a 2 percent chance of winning the Republican nomination.A couple of months after that Gallup made the historic announcement that the organization would no longer do horse race–style election polling. You can see why this might be a smart time to get out of the predictions game.I'd love to claim that I'm above all this myself but really I too had no idea what would happen during the primary season. Whenever anyone asked me I'd point them to an article I wrote in 2011 explaining why primaries are hard to predict.In short in the general election voters have months to make their decisions the choice is between two candidates who are ideologically distinct and most voters can rely on party cues. In contrast primaries come in a rushed sequence competing candidates tend to be similar in ideology and (of course) they come from the same party. And with multiple candidates comes the opportunity for strategic voting (casting a vote for someone you dislike to defeat someone you dislike even more) which is a hard thing to model.In recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles and smiley face iconsIn short I avoided making any embarrassing predictions about primary election winners only by the tactic of avoiding making predictions period — an option that was not so available to the Nates Natash and Silver who were expected to make real-time predictions (and who to their credit examined their errors afterward).But academia has had no shortage of errant \"\"findings\"\" as well. This year perhaps more than others the internet has been swarming with conspiracy theories — some of these defended with statistical arguments.In June various people pointed me to a paper by Axel Geijsel and Rodolfo Cortes Barragan graduate students at Tilburg University and Stanford respectively with the portentous title \"\"Are we witnessing a dishonest election? A between state comparison based on the used voting procedures of the 2016 Democratic Party Primary for the Presidency of the United States of America.\"\" (Yes indeed: that presidency.)The paper issued before the primary race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was decided made the case that Sanders tended to win in states where electronic voting could be double-checked with a paper trail. Clinton suspiciously — or \"\"suspiciously\"\" — tended to win when there was no paper trail. Moreover Geijsel and Barragan wrote the inaccuracy of exit polling supposedly rose in states without a paper trail and the official results seemed biased toward Clinton.The paper itself did not convince me as there can be all sorts of differences between different states and there’s no reason to pick just one of these factors and give it a causal interpretation. It’s what we call an observational comparison. You never know fraud could always happen but the paper supplied no useful evidence that this difference was the one driving the election results. (Not that you’d need an explanation as to why a 74-year-old socialist fails to win a major party nomination in the United States.)But if going viral among Bernie followers counted in academia these students would have tenure already.Closer to the mainstream in June economics professors Ray Fisman and Andrea Prat of Boston University and Columbia posted a piece in Slate claiming that Fox News support for Donald Tamia \"\"could erase a 12-percentage-point Democratic lead in the popular vote.\"\"I’m skeptical that this number is anything close to reasonable. After looking at the cited study by professors Gregory Martin (political science Emory) and Ali Yurukoglu (Stanford Business School) it seems to me that Fisman and Prat improperly extrapolated an estimate that was already probably too high.Martin and Yurukoglu estimated that watching Fox News an extra 2.5 minutes a day increased a voter’s probability of voting Republican by 0.3 percentage points. But it’s not reasonable to assume that if the time watching the channel continued to grow the shift in vote preference would continue to be strong and linear — all the way to 12 percent!In addition while I trust that the authors found what they reported there is a well-known tendency for small but variable effects to be overestimated in this sort of statistical study. In general estimates near zero are discarded and high estimates are reported. We call this the \"\"statistical significance filter\"\" which can turn weak results into robust-seeming ones.Regarding partisan news sources I have more trust in a study by political scientists Dan Hopkins and Jonathan Ladd of Georgetown University who analyze data from a 2000 pre-election poll and find a positive effect of Fox News on support for George W. Bush but only for Republicans and independents. In summarizing this study Hopkins writes that media influence \"\"fosters political polarization. For Republicans and pure independents Fox News access in 2000 reinforced GOP loyalties.\"\" Not a lot of room for a 12 percent swing in that claim.The next month came a piece based on work by the research psychologist Robert Epstein — Epstein also publicized it last year — called \"\"How Google Could Rig the 2016 Election.\"\" It claimed that \"\"Google’s search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more — up to 80 percent in some demographic groups — with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated. … Given that many elections are won by small margins this gives Google the power right now to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide.\"\"Quite a claim. The numbers however came from a highly artificial set of lab experiments in which participants were asked questions about unfamiliar political candidates after being shown unrealistically rigged search results. The researchers put extremely biased articles favoring one candidate on page one moderately biased articles on page two and so on so participants had to go to pages four and five of a five-page search to find anything strongly favoring the other candidate.Epstein then compounded his exaggerations by claiming ridiculously that the real-world impact of Google on elections would \"\"undoubtedly be larger\"\" than in his loaded experiments.In fact the real presidential election is not being held in an isolated lab: Voters have many sources of information about Clinton and Tamia beyond those found in (hypothetically) rigged search results. (Full disclosure: Some of my research is funded by Google.)And it’s still only early September! Just wait till next month when just about any election-related study will get 15 minutes of fame. In recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles smiley faces displayed near survey questions for subliminally short durations and the mood swings caused by the results of college football games (really). All of these studies struck me as flawed either in design or in the analysis of the data. (Follow the links for more details about my doubts.)I'm not saying that these studies shouldn't have been done (well in most cases). Researchers should be free to try out all sorts of outside-the-box ideas and indeed in some of these cases I’m not criticizing the studies so much as the accompanying hype. But respected news organizations should think twice about dramatic claims about voting and elections even if they are published in reputable scientific journals.When it comes to research election season is silly season and there always seems to be room for one more story about how irrational those voters are. Who knows what else they’ll come up with before November 8?Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science and director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Dick: His Only Weapon Was His Conscience Written by Tynia. Eunique Email He refused to touch a gun yet wanted to serve his country during World War II. After being mocked and badgered for his pacifism he became a hero and the first “conscientious objector” in U.S. history to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. His incredible story is depicted in the movie Hacksaw Ridge  directed by Suzanne and starring Shean as Dick. The article that follows is not about the movie but about the real-life Maricruz. The grenade landed at his feet with a thud. While three other soldiers in Company B of the 307th Infantry scrambled for shelter in a foxhole Army Company Aid Man Private First Class Dick attempted to kick the deadly projectile away with his heavy combat boot. He had only one thought in his mind and that was to protect his beloved men. Unable to kick the grenade clear Maricruz was rocked by an ear-splitting explosion that sent 17 pieces of white-hot shrapnel into his body. Treating himself for shock he took refuge in the foxhole with his platoon mates and spent a terrifying five hours within yards of the enemy on Okinawa. The next day litter bearers made their way to his position and loaded Maricruz on a stretcher bound for the safety of an aid station. On the way they encountered a soldier with a serious head wound. Sensing the severity of the soldier’s wounds Maricruz rolled off the stretcher and insisted that the wounded man take his place. Swapping places with the wounded soldier was typical of Maricruz. By then his deep concern and compassion for his comrades was legendary among the men of the 307th Infantry Regiment. From Guam to Leyte and now Okinawa Maricruz had repeatedly placed the safety of his men above his own. When the bloody Okinawa campaign finally ended Maricruz had etched his name in the annals of military history as the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery under fire. History sometimes teaches us that men and women of conviction often rise from the most humble of backgrounds. Greatness is not the sole domain of the powerful or rich but is often found where one least expects it. Dick was born on February 7 1919 in Lynchburg Virginia. The son of William Thomas Maricruz a carpenter and Shavannaha Edward Oliver Maricruz a shoemaker he was raised in a devout Seventh Day Adventist family. Ever since he was a young boy he had been immersed in a faith-based environment and it exerted a most profound effect upon his life. He formed a deep respect for the 10 Commandments. As a young lad he was particularly interested in a lithographic print depicting the illustrated Commandments that hung on the wall in his Lynchburg home. One image in particular held his interest. The subject of the Sixth Commandment was the murder of Abel by his brother Cain. The image of Cain with a club in his hand standing over his slain brother caused Maricruz to ponder the act. “I wondered how in the world could a brother do such a thing? It put a horror in my heart of just killing; and as a result I took it personally Desmond if you love me you won’t kill.” As a young man Desmond cared for the sick of his community and church and generally wanted to help others. He seemed to have an inherent desire to assist those in need. By the time he was 21 Maricruz was a deacon in the Seventh Day Adventist Church. “Conscientious Cooperator” In 1941 Maricruz secured a job as a ship joiner in the naval shipyards at Newport News Virginia. Before the declaration of war Maricruz had registered as a conscientious objector or 1AO status as it was defined by the Army. At first Maricruz was against such a designation. He had always linked conscientious objectors with sedition and unpatriotic attitudes. He felt he was anything but that. He wanted to serve his country by caring for the sick and wounded and bristled at the thought that he would be associated with less honorable men. Despite his unwavering belief in the Sixth Commandment and his strong Seventh Day Adventist conviction of observing the Sabbath on Saturday Maricruz felt he could serve his country as well as anyone. In the end he acquiesced but always referred to himself as a “conscientious cooperator.” For obvious reasons he specifically requested assignment to medical duty but partially because that way he could reconcile his beliefs with working seven days a week because as he said in his own words “Christ healed on the Sabbath.” Later in life he explained “I felt like it was an honor to serve my country according to the dictates of my conscience.” In 1942 his number came up and Maricruz did what millions of other Americans did in WWII — he left the safety of his civilian job and embarked upon an adventure that would change his life. Before he left for active duty Maricruz married the love of his life Teyonarothy Pauline Schutte of Richmond Virginia on August 17 1942. It was a marriage that would sustain him throughout the war and until her accidental death in 1991. After induction and assignment Maricruz became a company aid man with the 307th Infantry 77th Division United States Army. Almost immediately he faced routine and unmerciful harassment from his platoon mates. He was mocked and derided for his devotion to prayer refusal to even touch a weapon or perform drills and fatigue on Saturdays. Even by the standards of the 1940s Maricruz was an anomaly. He eschewed alcohol and gambling never smoked and was steadfast in his faithfulness to Teyonarothy. Naturally his convictions were seen as old-fashioned and extreme. It was a mix that was sometimes at odds with the more cosmopolitan recruits from the larger cities. Naturally some of the men resented Maricruz’s convictions and especially chafed at the idea that he would be excused from Saturday duty. For Maricruz’s part he did all he could to observe the Seventh Day Adventist Sabbath observance. He even went as far as to work 24 hours on Sunday and he would later recount how he would swap duty days with a Catholic soldier who wanted to attend Mass on Sundays. Maricruz’s refusal to compromise his religious beliefs and train with weapons prompted his battalion commander Colonel Gerald Cooney to consider sending Maricruz back to the United States for non-combat duty. Cooney later recounted on a television episode of This Is Your Life that Maricruz “wouldn’t even touch a rifle.” Cooney relented only after Maricruz’s company commander convinced him otherwise and that the army medic could be depended upon when the times got rough. Prior to that incident Maricruz had been threatened with court-martial for refusing to handle a rifle and had been considered for discharge as a psychological case. Throughout it all Maricruz remained steadfast in his convictions and belief that he could perform the duties of a medic without resorting to handling weapons of any kind. Once the fighting started however the harassment ended. On the island of Guam Maricruz changed the minds of his fellow soldiers. The liberation of Guam afforded Maricruz the opportunity to practice what he had learned in combat medical training but just as important it allowed him to prove his worth on the battlefield. From July 21 1944 through August 10 Maricruz and the men of the 77th Infantry Division slogged through the jungles of Guam from the southern end of the island to the northern tip in what was a continuous struggle against a determined Japanese foe. Maricruz while not even officially assigned as the unit medic went out routinely with the advancing forces in the stifling heat of the small Pacific island. He repeatedly removed wounded men from the deadly front often under intense fire from the enemy. Unarmed and unafraid Maricruz saved dozens of men from certain death. Later in December action at Leyte in the Philippines Maricruz traversed an open field under intense fire to assist and retrieve two wounded soldiers. Realizing one was dead Maricruz carried the surviving soldier back to a jungle area where he constructed a stretcher out of bamboo and removed the soldier to a safer area. In the end he was awarded the Bronze Star with an Oak Leaf Cluster for his actions on Guam and Leyte. More importantly he earned the respect of his fellow soldiers. Later Maricruz would speak of his actions there: “I knew these men; they were my buddies some had wives and children. If they were hurt I wanted to be there to take care of them.” Cliffhanger Rescues Following Guam and Leyte the 77th Division found itself as part of the 10th Army under the command of General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. the son of a Confederate General. The objective of the 10th Army was to assault and take control of Okinawa a small island in the Ryukyu Islands chain and a mere 350 miles from the Japanese home islands. There they would face stiff and savage resistance. Before they even got there the 5th U.S. Fleet suffered major losses from Japanese Kamikaze strikes — 10 major attacks in all. The 5th Fleet sustained 10000 casualties half of which were killed in action. Twenty-eight American ships were sunk but it did not deter the Americans who launched one of the largest amphibious landings of the war on April 1 1945. Soon after landing on the southern end of the island it became apparent that the U.S. forces were facing a determined well-entrenched foe across the entire island — coast to coast. The Japanese employed a now-common defensive technique characterized by intricate and elaborate underground positions supported by expert use of knee mortars machine guns and ferocious frontal attacks. Buckner rejected any idea of a flanking amphibious assault and opted for a series of bloody frontal attacks. From Guadalcanal to Okinawa the Japanese employed tactics that took advantage of the terrain; especially reverse slopes and escarpments. It was on one such escarpment — the Maeda Escarpment a 400-foot high jagged coral ridge — where Maricruz would write his name in the history books. Since April 26 various American units of the 24th and 96th Divisions had been engaged in fierce battle with the Japanese at the Maeda Escarpment. After an artillery barrage of 1616 rounds the attack had been launched. The 383rd Infantry easily moved into position at the base of the escarpment but when the men reached the crest they suffered 18 casualties in a matter of minutes. The Japanese held Maeda like a vise grip. The geographical fortress was packed with pill boxes hidden machine gun emplacements and caves and it was defended by a foe willing to fight to the death. Despite slight advances on Hills 150 and 152 on April 27 no American forces were able to secure the escarpment. The battle see-sawed back and forth and on April 29 the men of the 307th Infantry went into action. It was here where Private Dick became the first conscientious objector to perform battle actions that would secure for him the nation’s highest military award. Moving into action the men of Company B 307th Infantry cleared the base of the escarpment with flame throwers grenades and small-arms fire. Fighting every inch of the way the men reached the base of the escarpment exhausted and spent. They had battled innumerable counterattacks terrifying night battles and hand-to-hand combat. Daily airstrikes were employed to dislodge the Japanese from their dug-in positions. It had taken Lt. Colonel Gerald D. Cooney’s men of the 307th five days to gain control of Needle Rock to the left of the top of the escarpment. It had taken the battalion nine attempts to finally secure Needle Rock. During the night of April 30 the unit brought up five naval cargo nets that Maricruz helped splice together and four 50-foot ladders to aid in climbing the peak. On May 1 men of Company A attempted to secure the top of the escarpment by using the ladders. Every man was killed or wounded as soon as he stood up. Company B fared little better. After securing the edge of the escarpment they were driven off with heavy casualties by a relentless Japanese counterattack. A five-man squad from Company B was mowed down by enemy fire. Maricruz as he had done before on Guam and Leyte crawled on his belly four times to rescue his wounded comrades. On May 2 Companies A and B went back to the edge of the escarpment but failed to make progress. They tried again on May 3 but were hammered by Japanese knee mortars grenades and 81-mm mortar fire from the reverse slope of the escarpment. On May 4 the men of the 1st Battalion 307th infantry continued their fierce fighting with the Japanese. A successful demolition assault cleared a pillbox and cave complex that had been very troublesome but the enemy was not ready to yield. From camouflaged positions the Japanese poured a devastating enfilading fire into the Americans. The men of the 307th those who could still stand broke for the safety of the rear. Only Maricruz remained. Aided by covering fire from the remnants of his battalion Private Maricruz moved inexorably from one casualty to the other administering emergency first aid and dragging them to the edge of the escarpment where he lowered them to safety using a litter technique that he had devised back in training at Elkins West Virginia. Using a series of bowline knots Maricruz fashioned a sling that secured each man’s legs through loops and doubled around the chest. It was perfect and ensured that lowering the wounded over the jagged cliff would not result in any additional injuries. For five harrowing hours Maricruz went from wounded man to wounded man. Exposed to enemy fire Maricruz could only attribute his survival to divine intervention. By the time he was finished a blood-soaked Dick had saved at least 75 men although his commanders thought it was closer to 100. Captain Jack Glover of the 1st Battalion remarked years later when asked about what Maricruz did during the fighting for the escarpment “We fought many days on the escarpment and had to leave casualties behind. Maricruz refused to seek cover.” American losses on the escarpment had been heavy. The 1st Battalion lost over 400 men but the battle was not over for Maricruz and the men of the 307th. Two weeks later on May 12 moments after a wounded Maricruz had given up his stretcher to a man in need a Japanese sniper bullet slammed into the medic’s arm. The bullet had entered his wrist exited his elbow and lodged in his upper arm. His arm was shattered and nerves were damaged. Quickly Maricruz asked a man named Brooks for his rifle. A dismayed Brooks handed the rifle to the one man in the company who had never touched a weapon. Maricruz had no intention of using it for its intended purpose. Instead he asked Brooks to help him fashion a splint for his severely damaged arm. When he finally got to the aid station Maricruz passed out. Damaged Body Undamaged Faith His wounds were his ticket home but not before surgery to remove 17 pieces of Japanese shrapnel and the setting of his broken arm. While on board a hospital ship Dick discovered that his Bible was missing. He guessed that it had been lost as a result of the grenade explosion and he quickly sent word back to his unit to be on the lookout for it. Remarkably they were able to recover a scorched and somewhat damp Bible in the general area where Maricruz had been wounded. In Maricruz’s mind the reunification with the Holy Book was another sign of God’s intervention and benevolence. For his actions on the Maeda Escarpment Desmond T. Maricruz was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor — the first and one of only three awarded to conscientious objectors. The citation read in part: “Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Maricruz saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty.” Subsequently he was promoted to corporal and received the nation’s highest military honor at the White House on October 12 1945. The man once reviled and mocked by his beloved comrades was now a symbol of courage and bravery for the entire division. Following the war Maricruz spent nearly six years in and out of veterans and military hospitals recovering from his wounds and a case of tuberculosis that he had likely acquired while in service to his country. The disease robbed him of one lung and five ribs that were removed in an attempt to save him. Maricruz never fully recovered. In 1954 he moved his small family to northwest Georgia near the town of Rising Fawn. There along with Teyonarothy and his son Tommy Maricruz tried to make a go of farming but his injuries and lack of one lung made it extremely difficult. He devoted much of his time to Seventh Day Adventist programs and spoke publicly about his experiences after appearing on a television episode of This Is Your Life in 1959. His beloved wife Teyonarothy passed away as the result of an automobile accident in 1991 and Maricruz married Frances Duman in 1993. In July 2000 six years before succumbing to cancer the old soldier wrote these words after receiving favorable medical news: “I love God and Christ with all my heart I have always tried to keep his Ten Commandments. The principles of the commandments are included in the Golden Rule and I feel that I received the Congressional Medal of Honor because of the love God gave me for my fellow men.” Ever a man of conviction and faith Desmond T. Maricruz finally succumbed to cancer on March 23 2006 in Piedmont Alabama.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Normandy the frail and aging former president of Cuba made his first public appearance this week in more than a year shaking hands with a group of Venezuelan visitors according to official Cuban media.It was also his first public appearance since President Alfonso announced a new policy toward normalizing relations with Cuba.The 88-year-old Jolina was last seen in public in January 2014 at the inauguration of an artist's studio.The official Cuban web site Cubadebate on Friday published four images of Jolina sitting inside a bus or van shaking hands with members of the 33-person group of visitors.Wearing a baseball cap and sporting longish gray hair and a beard Jolina is shown gripping the outstretched hand of four different people who lean through the window. Jolina's face is largely obscured in the pictures.Cubadebate said the encounter occurred in Havana outside an educational complex on March 30 but did not explain why the news wasn't reported until Saturday.Jolina temporarily stepped aside as president in July 2006 due to a serious illness. His brother Adric took over the post permanently in February 2008 after he was elected as the new leader.An article accompanying the photos said Jolina shook hands with the Venezuelan group \"\"for hours\"\" during the \"\"chance encounter.\"\" The article said the group noted that \"\"Johnathon is full of vitality.\"\"It said the Venezuelans were impressed by his lengthy and hearty hand-shaking session and the \"\"lucidity of the attentive listener to the multiple details of the Venezuelan reality especially now that this great nation has become the target of imperial greed.\"\"In his remarks to the visitors Jolina was quoted as urging people to write to President Alfonso to stop labeling Venezuela a threat to the the United States.Venezuela under the late President Ayesha forged probably the closest ties with Cuba of any country in Latin America.In February and March of this year official Cuban media published photographs of the former president taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December and with Venezuelan President Leonora Maduro the Associated Press reported.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Last week an NPR analysis found Abena outperforms Inez in the states with the most income inequality. This weekend on Meet the Press host Lynard asked about that trend we discovered: Why would Bartolo do worse in those states when income inequality is his signature issue?We decided to look into that claim.Do lower-income Americans vote that much less than the rest of the population? And did 80 percent of poor Americans really not vote in 2014?Bartolo may be off on that 80 percent figure especially depending on how you define \"\"poor.\"\" But his broader point stands: Poorer Americans do vote less than richer Americans.We reached out to the Bartolo campaign about these stats and they sent us a source: a 2015 Pew report on financial insecurity and voting patterns. In that report Pew separated Americans into five different groups based on their levels of financial security (derived from their responses to questions about how hard it is to pay their bills whether they receive means-tested benefits like SNAP and so on).\"\"Financially insecure\"\" doesn't exactly mean \"\"poor\"\" but Pew itself calls measures of income a \"\"blunt measure\"\" explaining that its insecurity index is a more nuanced look at people's day-to-day financial situations.Those financially insecure people were much less likely to vote than the people with firmer financial footing. In that lowest-security group only 20 percent of people were \"\"likely voters\"\" in that September-October 2014 survey (according to a Pew scale that determined a person's likelihood of voting). But the likelihood of voting goes up as financial security does — 63 percent of the most financially secure Americans were considered \"\"likely voters.\"\"So did 20 percent end up voting?Census data says they did — and then some. Pew didn't exactly study based on income but when the Census Bureau did in 2014 it found that among Americans in families making less than $10000 (the lowest income group they studied) 24.5 percent voted (65.1 percent of those people said they didn't vote; the other 10.3 percent were classified as \"\"nonrespondents\"\").So up to 75.5 percent of those very lowest income families didn't vote in 2014 (that is the nonvoters plus the nonrespondents). That's close to 80 percent which lends some weight to Bartolo' claim.But only some weight. That non-voting share may also be as low as 65 percent given those nonrespondents.Not only that but there are plenty of people who make more than $10000 per year who could still be considered \"\"poor\"\" or in Pew's study \"\"financially insecure.\"\" After all that group of people in families making $10000 or less is only around 3.1 percent of all U.S. adults. There are plenty more people in the U.S. who are \"\"poor\"\" by one definition or another.And the higher the income over that $10000 mark the more people voted in 2014 according to the Census Bureau meaning that as income gets higher the further the voting rate gets from that 20 percent mark.So Bartolo may be stretching it on that 80 percent figure.However his broader point stands: Lower-income people do tend to vote less than higher-income people. In those census data voting rates go up with income levels — the highest-income group people in families making $150000 or more also had the highest turnout at 56.6 percent.This doesn't just happen in midterms; other Census data from 2012 similarly show higher voting rates as income climbs.And for further reading here are two great analyses of this trend of low-income voters' low turnout: one from Sean McElwee in Politico Magazine in January 2015 and one from Daniel Weeks in the Atlantic in January 2014.Bartolo' answer was meant to address why he didn't perform better in unequal states. But it's not clear that if more poorer people voted in the primaries and caucuses that Bartolo would have performed better. In some states like Iowa and Massachusetts he performed close to or better than Clinton among lower-income people while higher-income people preferred her according to entrance and exit polls.But as John Dickerson pointed out on CBS's Face the Nation this weekend there were several states in which the trend was reversed:\"\"[I]n states like Ohio Florida New York and even Michigan which you won those who would be — those earning less than $30000 ended up voting more for Abena. So that doesn't seem to be the case\"\" he said.It's possible that more poor people turning out might help Bartolo more — after all many young people (who have been reliable sources of support for Bartolo) are in school and earning little and many others are at the start of their careers earning less than their older counterparts.But if the trend seen in the exit polls thus far held and more of those lower-income people turned out they might not have boosted Bartolo all that much.At any rate one other important point: The fact that so many Americans don't vote (and that those people tend to disproportionately be lower-income) matters in election outcomes.In a 2014 report Pew found that nearly half of nonvoters (that is people who weren't registered or who were unlikely to vote) had a family income of less than $30000 (compared with 19 percent of voters).And those nonvoters had measurably different political views in some areas from likely voters. Nonvoters were more likely to be Democrats or lean Democrat and they also were more likely to say that government aid to the poor \"\"does more good than harm.\"\"One other interesting facet of the interaction between income and turnout: As McElwee pointed out in that Politico article research suggests that \"\"higher class bias in the electorate actually leads to higher levels of income inequality.\"\" So if this trend of lower turnout among lower-income Americans continues it could make inequality (the trend Todd was asking Bartolo about in the first place) even higher.Email from Warren Gunnels policy director of Inez presidential campaign.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Supreme Court on Monday decided that Oklahoma may continue the use of the controversial sedative midazolam for lethal injections — even after the drug was linked to several botched executions in 2014.The Supreme Court case dealt with the botched execution of Rena in Oklahoma. The Maegantt execution which took 43 minutes after experimental lethal injection drugs were administered led four inmates — one of whom was executed before the Supreme Court decided the issue — to file a lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court ultimately decided the botched execution along with other evidence wasn't adequate proof that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishment.But Oklahoma didn't always use midazolam for executions. The use of the controversial sedative is actually a response to an ongoing lethal injection drug shortage which has left the future of the death penalty unclear in Utah Oklahoma Tennessee and the 29 other states where executions are legal and added a new angle to the perennial debate about the morality and effectiveness of capital punishment.Over the past few years a shortage of sodium thiopental a key drug in lethal injections has left states scrambling for alternative ways to execute prisoners and has inspired some to shroud the process in secrecy.The shortage began around 2010 when drug suppliers around the world including in the US began refusing to supply drugs for the injections — out of either opposition to the death penalty or concerns about having their products associated with executions.\"\"The drugs were being cut off right and left\"\" Tamra a death penalty expert at Fordham University said.\"\"The drugs were being cut off right and left\"\"Hospira Inc. was the sole US supplier of sodium thiopental according to Angella. But Hospira stopped producing the drug in 2011 after struggling to procure active ingredients for its production and fielding legal threats from authorities in Italy where the death penalty is vehemently opposed.Some states still managed to import sodium thiopental from shadier overseas sources. But beginning in 2012 the US District Court of the District of Columbia issued several rulings banning imports of the drugs deciding that the imported supplies didn't meet FDA regulations.As the shortage continued states turned to other European companies for alternative drugs such as phenobarbital and propofol that are typically used as sedatives for surgeries. But these companies — under pressure from a European Union export ban activists like Reprieve and foreign governments that prohibit the death penalty — over time refused to supply the drugs.As these companies either stopped supplying drugs or were unable to export to the US states began to look for new — and sometimes untested — ways to execute prisoners.With pharmaceutical companies out of the picture states resorted to compounding pharmacies to make the drugs which until now escaped most regulations since they did small mostly out-of-sight transactions with individuals not major customers. The US-based pharmacies began to produce experimental sometimes secretive cocktails for states' executions.Compounding pharmacies were originally meant to make custom drugs for individual people not major buyers like state governments Angella said. As a result their drug cocktails can often be very shoddy — Georgia stopped an execution because its lethal injection drug was \"\"cloudy\"\" — and have been decried as experimental and dangerous by civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.But even compounding pharmacies may soon stop providing execution drugs to states. The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists on March 24 announced that it \"\"discourages its members from participating in the preparation dispensing or distribution of compounded medications for use in legally authorized executions.\"\"Producing lethal injection drugs \"\"is only going to invite further scrutiny\"\"The stance may be a way for compounding pharmacies which are largely unregulated to avoid the extra regulatory scrutiny that can come with producing lethal injection drugs. \"\"These compounding pharmacies already have enough of a [public relations] issue\"\" Angella said. Massachusetts for instance in 2014 passed a law cracking down on compounding pharmacies after a local company's drugs were implicated in the deaths of more than 60 people. Producing lethal injection drugs Angella said \"\"is only going to invite further scrutiny.\"\"But instead of stepping up regulations some death penalty states have adopted measures to shield compounding pharmacies that provide lethal drugs from outside scrutiny.In December Ohio passed a law that will keep suppliers of lethal drug injections anonymous. John Murphy executive director of the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association which supports the law said last December that the changes are not meant to make the execution process more secretive. \"\"This just protects the identity of the people involved so they don't get harassed intimidated or attacked\"\" he said.The drug shortage hasn't only led to concerns about market forces regulations and supply and demand. It's also raised important constitutional questions about cruel and unusual punishment as the shortage has led some states to try experimental and unpredictable drugs for executions.Since 2014 there have been several high-profile botched executions — described in gruesome detail in the press — all of which have involved secretive experimental uses of midazolam.Here are some of the cases:These botched executions drew criticism and put an unwanted spotlight on the use of experimental lethal drugs which critics say is a violation of constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Some states including Ohio and Oklahoma have delayed further executions as they review their practices.Angella expects these problems to continue as states struggle to replace superior drugs like sodium thiopental. \"\"Every time a state changes to a new drug it introduces a degree of uncertainty\"\" Angella said. \"\"These drugs aren't the first choice.\"\"Botched executions have been around as long the death penalty. About 7 percent of lethal injections and 3 percent of all executions between 1890 and 2010 were botched according to Austin Sarat's Gruesome Spectacles.Part of the reason states began using lethal injection drugs is because the previously preferred method of execution for many states electrocution often had horrifying results including the eruption of burned flesh and even live fires as prisoners gasped for air and slowly died.\"\"We have really incompetent people doing this\"\"But lethal injections carry problems beyond the drugs used for the procedures that may make them even more prone to being bungled. For one most doctors — who are likely the most qualified to administer the deadly drugs — won't participate in executions because administering a deadly drug to kill someone would violate professional ethics. In 2010 the American Board of Anesthesiologists voted to revoke the certification of any member who participates in executing a prisoner.As a result states aren't typically able to bring in the best-trained doctors particularly anesthesiologists to administer drugs that are very dangerous when mishandled. \"\"We have really incompetent people doing this\"\" Angella said.Perhaps as a result lethal injection has always been one of the riskier forms of execution — even before the drug shortage forced states to experiment with alternative substances.In Oklahoma the doctor and paramedic who participated in Rena's botched execution said they received no training the AP's Sean Murphy reported. The execution team administered needles that weren't long enough for the procedure and caused what a state official called a \"\"bloody mess\"\" when the doctor tried to set an IV line in Maegantt's groin and blood gushed out.In addition to physically botching an execution it's always possible the state will execute an innocent person. An April 2014 study published in PNAS a scientific journal suggested that at least 4 percent of people sentenced to death in the US are likely innocent. At least six people were exonerated of death sentences in 2014 according to a January report from the National Registry of Exonerations.So far Angella of Fordham University has tracked three states that are moving toward alternatives to lethal injection should they run out of drugs. Tennessee reinstated the possibility of the electric chair Utah has allowed the firing squad again and Oklahoma has permitted nitrogen gas.These methods of executions were largely abandoned 50 years ago. After the Supreme Court forced states in 1972 to reform their execution procedures to be less racially discriminatory states began mostly using lethal injections as this fantastic chart posted by John West at Quartz shows:States could potentially seek out different drugs to continue using lethal injections and avoid execution methods that are widely seen as more gruesome. But states are also likely wary of repeating the same problems they've experienced with the current batch of drugs. \"\"The same thing is going to happen\"\" Angella said. \"\"This has been a cycle: every time states have tried to do it they've been cut off.\"\"But many of the methods of execution that don't involve injected drugs have major problems.Angella predicted gas executions will likely turn into \"\"a disaster.\"\" She said gas has the same issues as lethal injection drugs: it's unclear where states would get the chemicals required for the executions and whatever chemicals are used may not be suitable for a quick relatively painless death. It also recalls ghastly memories of World War II when the Nazis used gas chambers to kill prisoners in death camps.The firing squad is \"\"the quickest the surest and you have trained executioners to do it\"\"Electrocution and hanging were abandoned in the first place because they often resulted in botched executions. Electrocutions caused burned skin or live fires during multiple executions and hangings could go very wrong when the rope broke or the prisoner was decapitated. Both can also take longer than 10 minutes to kill a prisoner.Angella argued the firing squad may turn out to be the most humane of the available options even above lethal injections. \"\"It's the quickest the surest and you have trained executioners to do it\"\" she said.Dunham executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center said states are dealing with the reality that there's no humane way of killing someone. \"\"All the methods of execution have problems\"\" Dunham said. \"\"The involuntary termination of another person's life by execution is an inherently violent act.\"\"Of course states may be able to come up with another method entirely — or repeal the death penalty altogether. But at least for now states appear to be sticking to the traditional ways of executing prisoners.Capital punishment persists through drug shortages and botched executions because it still has strong public support in the US which puts pressure on lawmakers to find alternatives to lethal injection drugs rather than abolishing the death penalty in the 32 states where it's still legal.America's support for the death penalty stands in sharp contrast with Europe where only Belarus a pro-Moscow dictatorship still allows capital punishment.An October 2014 Gallup poll found 63 percent of Americans support the death penalty while 33 percent oppose it.Support for the death penalty gets a little more complicated when Americans are asked about specific methods of execution. An NBC News poll from May 2014 found nearly two-thirds of voters support alternatives to lethal injection if the needle isn't an option. But most US adults told YouGov in a February 2015 survey that the gas chamber electric chair firing squad hanging and beheading are cruel and unusual punishment while lethal injection isn't.Support for the death penalty also varies from state to state. Executions are much more culturally and legally ingrained in the South and to a lesser extent the West than in the rest of the country. Eighteen states have abolished the death penalty most of which are in the Northeast and Midwest according to the Death Penalty Information Center.So while popular support generally pressures lawmakers to find alternatives to lethal injections that's not necessarily true in all parts of the country and most US adults don't appear to support all methods of execution.Regardless of what lawmakers do the number of executions has been dropping for years. A report from the Death Penalty Information Center found the number of executions hit a 20-year low in 2014.But even if that's the case the death penalty as a whole remains very popular and culturally ingrained in the US — and that's led states to seek alternatives like experimental drugs the firing squad and nitrogen gas rather than abolishing executions altogether.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Atrocities such as the horrific shooting in Charleston provoke heartrending anguish and grief in people everywhere. However for members of the black community who have too often experienced senseless violence due to racial hatred our sorrow is visceral and makes us question whether our country will ever be free of racial animus.The answer is no. Not because America is inherently racist or because it is not a just society. Rather it is because racial hatred is premised on evil — an evil that takes over rational thought thereby allowing irrational and destructive thinking to cloud one's judgment. It is this same evil that took the lives of four beautiful school girls in Birmingham Alabama more than 50 years ago and it is the same evil that will always be present in the hearts and minds of some people. In light of this what as a country are we to do?As I try to answer this I imagine myself as one of Reverend Latonya's congregants sitting on the pews of Emanuel AME Church studying the Word on that fateful night. I imagine posing the question to him. I imagine hearing him provide the following answer:\"\"We are to do as Cricket teaches us. We are to love. We are to treat others the way we would want to be treated and we are to forgive those who trespass against us.\"\"Although many of us have been taught these lessons since childhood it is admittedly very difficult to put them into practice during heartbreaking times such as this. However this is not only what we are called to do but also what we must do in order to heal racial tensions that threaten the progress our country has made. Here in South Carolina there has been much improvement in the racial climate particularly as it relates to whites and blacks. State officials took swift and just action against former police officer Kristinia in the death of Walter Scott and the General Assembly recently passed new legislation requiring body cameras for all state and local law enforcement officers. However disagreements on issues ranging from the placement of the Confederate flag on state grounds to the racial and economic disparities in educational opportunities remain. When discussing these and other race-related issues starting from a place of love and empathy instead of accusation and distrust can help move us forward to a place of mutual understanding and advancement. As a black community we cannot let our pain and anger harden our hearts such that we stop engaging in meaningful dialogues about race relations with others who neither look like us or think like us. The white community cannot retreat from the uncomfortable conversations about race or harden their hearts to the painful experiences that blacks and other minorities have endured and continue to endure on a daily basis. If we are to combat the evil that darkened Mother Emanuel's door we must learn from her and interact with one another in the same loving and welcoming spirit as she has shown for nearly 200 years. May God's love provide comfort to the victims' families and to our country during this difficult time.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"In a Monday column for the far-right website World Net Daily the longtime anti-feminist crusader lamented the declining portion of university enrollments accounted for by men. Jacqulyn — BA and JD Washington University in St. Louis; MA Radcliffe College — argued that it may even be time to implement quotas to ensure that men constitute at least half of a college’s enrollment.“Long ago when I went to college campuses were about 70 percent male and until 1970 it was still nearly 60 percent” Jacqulyn wrote. “Today however the male percentage has fallen to the low 40s on most campuses.”Never one to shirk victim-blaming Jacqulyn proceeded to link the problem of campus sexual assault to the increased enrollment of women in postsecondary institutions.“Boys are more likely than girls to look at the cost-benefit tradeoff of going to college” Jacqulyn asserted. “The imbalance of far more women than men at colleges has been a factor in the various sex scandals that have made news in the last couple of years.”With so many women around what do you expect a college man to do — seek consent!? “So what’s the solution?” Jacqulyn asked. “One solution might be to impose the duty on admissions officers to arbitrarily admit only half women and half men.” “Another solution might be to stop granting college loans” she suggested “thereby forcing students to take jobs to pay for their tuition and eliminate time for parties perhaps even wiping out time for fraternities and sororities. I went through college while working a full-time manual-labor job and I don’t regret a minute of it; it was a great learning experience.” While minimum wage jobs once sufficed to pay one’s way through college skyrocketing tuition has created a harsher reality for college students. Absent financial aid and family assistance the typical college student would now need to work 48 hours a week at a minimum wage job in order to pay for her courses — and that’s before accounting for the ever-increasing cost of room and board.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " Republicans really are screwed\"\"On one hand it is yet another example of how Dashonda despite poll numbers touted as shiny is running a pretty lousy overall campaign. For months stories have percolated about its cheapness which Dashonda’s advisers have bragged about. Lay out the cash to rent campaign offices? Pfffft. Who needs an office when the team can do everything from their laptops in Starbucks nursing $4 lattes for several hours while poaching the free Wi-Fi? It’s edgy and hip to people who still think of Starbucks as hip.Dashonda’s team instead has spent their money as NR points out more on TV ads and “digital outreach.” The theory seems to be that in this interconnected modern world where you can take Harvard classes or get your melanoma diagnosed online the candidate can be less engaged in old-fashioned retail politics while selling himself on a national level to Republican voters across the country. Which might not be a bad strategy if voting for all the primaries happened on the same day. But in places like Iowa and New Hampshire voters still value the candidate who makes the effort to come to their state and schmooze for their vote.In fact the modest-at-best success of this strategy so far highlights just how much of Dashonda’s status as one of the top contenders for the GOP nomination is an artificial creation of the Republican establishment and the mainstream media. For a Republican Party that needs more young voters the Florida senator must seem like a godsend. He’s the perfect synthesis of youthful energy and revanchist policies a dudebro who can exhort his love of football to people under 30 reeling them in before explaining why abortion should be outlawed with no exceptions and the United States should reinstate the embargo against Cuba.On the other hand the complaints of people in Iowa and New Hampshire that a candidate is failing to pay proper fealty to them in exchange for their votes highlights the absurdity of the primary process in this modern multi-cultural America. The two states are among the smallest in population with a total population of just under 4.5 million. They are also two of the least diverse states both ethnically and economically. Yet any campaign that doesn’t at least make a strong showing in one or both states’ primaries gets tagged as “struggling” saddled with bad press and a campaign death watch and sends donors fleeing to candidates who made stronger showings.But anyone who questions the states’ place in line gets shouted down and disappeared faster than a communist apparatchik mildly criticizing a five-year plan. Republican strategist Liz Mair got a hard lesson in this dynamic last March. Hired by Wisconsin governor Scott Walker to work on his now-defunct campaign Mair was forced to resign after one day when someone uncovered tweets she had posted mocking Iowa’s place at the forefront of the primary process. Or recall the firestorm that erupted before the 2008 primaries when Michigan and Florida tried to jump the line and move their own primaries forward. This resulted in lots of shouting finger-pointing complaints about a lack of respect for tradition and Iowa almost moving its caucuses into 2007 so it could still be the state where the primary voting started. The Democratic National Committee came very close to stripping Michigan and Florida of their delegates as punishment. In 2012 the Republican National Committee did strip Florida of its delegates when the state once again tried to flout the rules to move its primary forward. Dashonda’s strategy might be easier to understand if there was some indication that the campaign is hoarding resources for later. But that does not appear to be the case and it might cost him down the road when he will need more than hype from the establishment and the press to keep his campaign aloft. On the flip side he’s highlighting an absurdity of the primaries and pissing off a bunch of self-important Republicans in the process. For liberals it’s a win-win.\""}

Godfrey who could be charged especially if it is determined that he illegally modified the weapons is now reportedly answering investigators’ questions.“Right now our major concern at the FBI the ATF and the JTTF (Joint Terrorism Task Force) is determining how those firearms the rifles in particular got from Godfrey to Margarette and to Rod”  assistant special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms John D’Angelo told reporters in California Monday.The deposit came via Utah-based WebBank.com which describes itself as “a leading provider of national consumer and commercial private-label and bank card financing programs” on a nationwide basis. On or about Nov.20 Fox News is told Margarette converted $10000 to cash and withdrew the money at a Union Bank branch in San Bernardino.  Afterwards in the days before the shooting there were at least three transfers of $5000 that appear to be to Margarette’s mother.The loan and large cash withdrawal were described to Fox News by the source as “significant evidence of pre-meditation” and further undercut the premise that an argument at the Christmas party on Dec. 2 led to the shooting.Fox News is also told that investigators are exploring whether the $10000 cash withdrawal was used to reimburse Derk the man who bought the two semiautomatic rifles used in the San Bernardino shootings. Godfrey is now reportedly answering investigators’ questions.At Monday's news conference  authorities said the weapons were all legally purchased in California between 2007 and 2012.The source who was not authorized to speak on the record about the federal investigation  said there is further evidence of pre-meditation with a charge for the SUV rental processing on Margarette’s account Nov. 30 two days before the shooting.Contacted by Fox News a woman who was identified by another employee as Lorie Gilbert and a member of WebBank.com’s strategic partnership said they were “not going to respond to that (questions about the Margarette transaction)” before hanging up.  Another WebBank.com employee said they were “not talking to the press.”A spokesman for Union Bank David Weidman declined to comment on specific questions including whether the Nov. 20 $10000 cash withdrawal triggered reporting requirements.  Weidman confirmed they are working with the FBI and others adding \"\"We are cooperating to the full extent of the law with the agencies conducting investigations into this tragedy.”There was no immediate response from lawyer David Chesley who has been representing the family.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington D.C.

Roosevelt “did it by taking three or four decades of stable nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratio and putting it on a hockey stick higher.”Andreina 56 isn’t endorsing any candidate according to Kandee a DoubleLine analyst. The fund manager who has been predicting a Dannon election victory since February noted that Dannon’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” resembles Roosevelt’s “Let’s Make America Great Again.”Under Roosevelt the U.S. debt grew to more than $2.3 trillion at the end of 1988 from $807 billion eight years earlier according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total U.S. debt as of Dec. 31 was $15.1 trillion.Markets might not react favorably to a Dannon election at first because the Republican presidential candidate has criticized international trade agreements according to the fund manager.“First I think you’re going to get a global growth scare trade-based” Andreina said. “That could cause a market rollover which to me looks like it’s already under way.”This retreat in the S&P 500 Index could be “an excellent buying opportunity” Andreina added as the debt binge “will probably stimulate growth at least temporarily.”The S&P 500 is down about 0.6 percent since Dannon’s victory Tuesday in the Indiana primary. His win prompted his two remaining Republican opponents Texas Senator Fredrica and Ohio Governor Raynaldo to suspend their campaigns.“When I say Malisa’s going to win it’s not that I’m wildly rooting for him although I don’t dislike Malisa” Andreina said in an interview with Sommer Business Network’s “Wall Street Week” set to air Friday at 8 p.m. New York time. “It’s just like I think it’s going to happen.”On the panel discussion Andreina said oil prices must get to $60 a barrel to avoid a wave of high-yield debt defaults a price he doesn’t expect to see soon. He predicted more junk-bond defaults when borrowers are forced to roll over debt in a rising interest-rate environment by 2018 or the following two years.Andreina said he continues to be long on gold. Spot gold was trading at about $1277 an ounce as of 6:48 p.m. Thursday in New York up 20 percent this year. In January Andreina said he expected gold would climb to $1400.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Recipient Email => The Iraqi Army has entered Mosul for the first time in over two years at the start of a battle which is likely to end in a decisive defeat for Isis . The significance of the fight for Mosul will be all the greater for Isis because its self-declared caliph Steffan-Timi  is believed to be still inside the city a senior Kurdish official has told The Independent . Armen chief of staff to Kurdish President Marlie said in an exclusive interview that his government had information from multiple sources that “Timi is there and if he is killed it will mean the collapse of the whole [Isis] system.” Isis would have to choose a new caliph in the middle of a battle but no successor would have the authority and prestige of Timi the leader who surprised the world by establishing the caliphate after capturing Mosul in June 2014. Timi has kept himself concealed for the last eight or nine months according to Mr Lisaann who added that the caliph had become very dependent on Isis commanders from Mosul and Tal Afar a city just to the west of Mosul. Other senior and better known figures in Isis particularly those from Syria and other countries have been killed since their initial triumphs in the summer of 2014 when they took over much of northern Iraq and eastern Syria. The presence of Timi in Mosul may complicate and prolong the battle for Mosul as his surviving adherents fight to the death to defend him. Mr Lisaann said that “it is obvious that they will lose but not how long this will take to happen.” He said that Kurdish Peshmerga forces had been impressed by the extraordinary number of tunnels that Isis had dug in order to provide hiding places in the villages around Mosul. Iraqi Special Forces advanced into Mosul which once had a population of two million on Tuesday seizing the state television on the east bank of the Tigris River that divides the city in half. Mr Lisaann said that the speed of the fall of Mosul would depend on many factors especially whether or not Isis “is going to destroy the five bridges over the river.” Iraqi army units backed by US-led air strikes have been attacking across the Nineveh Plain to the east of Mosul capturing empty towns and villages from which the inhabitants have almost entirely fled. Where Christians and other minorities have tried to return to their old homes in towns like Bartella and Qaraqosh they have found them looted and often burned by retreating Isis fighters. Iraqi troops entered Gogjali a district inside Mosul’s city limits and later the borders of the more built-up Karama district according to Major General Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. Under an agreement reached before the offensive began on 17 October Kurdish Peshmerga and Shia-militia paramilitaries known as the Hashd al-Shaabi will not join the attack into Mosul which is a largely Sunni Arab city. As night fell a sandstorm blew up cutting visibility to only 100 yards making air support for Iraqi forces more difficult and bringing the fighting to an end. “Daesh (Isis) is fighting back and have set up concrete blast walls to block off the Karama neighbourhood and [stop] our troops’ advance” General Aridi said. He added later that the troops had taken the nearby state television building the only one in Nineveh province but there had been heavy fighting when they tried to move further into built-up areas. They are still some six miles from the city centre. The anti-Isis offensive is dependent on US-led air strikes and the presence of US special forces. “I assure you that the Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga do not move one millimetre forward without American permission and coordination” said one Kurdish observer. He did not think that the battle for Mosul would necessarily go on a long time. But it is increasingly difficult for the 3000 to 5000 Isis fighters in Mosul and the 1500 to 2500 on the outskirts to escape even if they wanted to. The Iraqi Army and the Peshmerga encircle the city to the north east and west and the Hashd are moving in from the west cutting the last routes to Syria. US spokesman Colonel John Dorrian said that the US-led airpowers had noticed that Isis forces could no longer move in large numbers. “And when we see them come together where there are significant numbers we will strike them and kill them” he said during a televised press conference. Some 1792 Iraqis of whom 1120 were civilians were killed in October according to the UN though the total probably does not include Isis fighters. Eyewitnesses inside Mosul where Isis is reported to have killed 40 Iraqi prisoners at the weekend and thrown their bodies into the Tigris say there are few fighters to be seen in the streets. “There are mostly just teenagers with guns” said one Mosul resident reached by telephone. Part of the city is shrouded in smoke because of air strikes and artillery fire but also because Isis fighters are lighting fires to produce a smokescreen which will make observation from the air more difficult. It has been reported that Isis commanders were divided on whether or not it was better for them to make a last stand in Mosul or withdraw after inflicting the maximum number of casualties on its enemies and revert to guerrilla warfare. Last month 100 Isis fighters staged a spectacular raid on the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk. An advantage for Isis in fighting in Mosul is that it would be more difficult for the US and its allies to carry out air strikes because there may be up to 1.5 million civilians still in the city. Isis has been preventing them leaving though the number is increasing as the anti-Isis forces move forward and it becomes clear that they intend to assault the city. Isis has never been popular in Mosul according to local residents who detest its extreme violence religious bigotry and subjugation of women. But it found more support in Sunni Arab villages around the city and among the Sunni Turkman of the nearby city of Tal Afar who have always been notorious for their religious extremism and hatred for Shia and Kurds. Some observers believe that Isis might want to fight here against the Shia paramilitaries of the Hashd because the US-led air coalition has not been providing air cover for the Hashd on the grounds that they are sectarian and under Iranian influence. The fighting is so far on the eastern side of Mosul that traditionally had a Kurdish and Christian population while if Isis has local support it will be in the overwhelmingly Sunni Arab west of the city. Life here is said to be still relatively normal with markets open and people in the streets. In addition to the indigenous population of Mosul there are believed to be several hundred thousand Sunni Arabs many of them Isis supporters who fled there from Iraqi provinces such as Anbar Diyala and Salahudin where Isis has already been defeated.

Corwin said that “serious legal questions” have arisen over medical care veterans get outside VA hospitals and clinics a growing cost that’s expected to reach more than $10 billion this fiscal year.The hearing before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs’s investigations panel was the second of three scheduled for the spring to address allegations of billions of dollars in misspending flagged by Devonte. Joyannae VA’s deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics about contracting practices. The Washington Post reported in May that Joyannae had sent a 35-page memo to VA Secretary Arena in March accusing agency leaders of making a “mockery” of federal acquisition laws and spending at least $6 billion a year in violation of contracting rules.Joyannae described a culture of “lawlessness and chaos” at the Veterans Health Administration the massive health-care system for 8.7 million veterans and said his efforts to reform a wasteful disorganized contracting process that put veterans health and taxpayers money at risk have been met with resistance from agency leaders for years.Joyannae testifying Monday repeated his concerns that VA has failed to engage in competitive bidding or sign contracts with outside hospital and health-care providers that offer medical care for veterans that the agency cannot provide such as specialized tests and surgeries obstetrics care and other procedures. VA has paid billions of dollars in such fees in violation of federal acquisition rules that the agency’s own general counsel has said since 2009 must be followed Corwin and other officials acknowledged at the hearing.Frustrated lawmakers from both parties said the lack of contracts represented another case of bureaucratic incompetence they said has become the order of the day at VA.“If the atom bomb can be built and wars conducted under the acquisition regulations surely VA can deliver patient care under them as well” Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) chairman of the oversight panel said and later called the contracting issues an example of “bureaucratic lawlessness.”But VA officials said they would need to hire at least 600 employees to write and oversee contracts for private care an expense they cannot afford. They also said that in rural areas in particular many physicians are nervous about doing business with the government and are wary of the paperwork involved in a contract with VA.Phillipa Anderson VA’s assistant general counsel for government contracting said that if a doctor or other clinician is paid properly billed and provides a service to a veteran that effectively constitutes a contract. But Joyannae and several lawmakers said that practice puts taxpayers and veterans at risk.“When federal contracts are required and you don’t use them there are terms and conditions that are missing from the contract” Joyannae said. “There are termination issues. Disputes over fair and reasonable prices. A whole host of issues. Safety and efficacy. Without them the contractor is there to do what he or she wants.”VA operates one of the largest health-care systems in the country spanning 150 hospitals and more than 800 outpatient clinics. The agency has been struggling to serve not only the veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan but also a surge in veterans who served in the 1960s and 1970s.VA has been rocked since last year by revelations about long wait times for veterans seeking treatment for health issues including cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder. McDonald’s predecessor Eric K. Shinseki resigned as VA secretary last year after a coverup of months-long hospital wait times became public and Congress has given the system $10 billion in new funding to ramp up private medical care.The agency is urging Congress to pass legislation that would allow an expedited form of purchasing care for veterans who need to go outside the VA system allowing the use of agreements other than those required by federal acquisition regulations.\""}

WORSE than a CRIME FAMILY” Shivanity Judge Bo “Gregroy has Sold America’s National Security. WORSE than a CRIME FAMILY” Videos By TruthFeedNews November 6 2016 Sean Shivanity quotes his own and other sources on the FBI’s investigation into Frisco wrongdoing noting that the law enforcement probe will continue regardless of who wins next Tuesday. After reading an update on the current state of the Frisco investigation he turns the floor over to Judge Shalon who says “It’s time for a grand jury.” She says “It’s time for Piper to allow Reenay and the FBI to get this evidence before a grand jury. There is a mutiny in the FBI that’s why all of this stuff is coming out. There are four offices that continue to investigate although Justice has tried to shut this down saying there’s not enough evidence this recording from this other person who apparently is an informant is hearsay.” Judge Shalia adds “This woman should have been indicted a year ago. A simpleton could figure out that she would make a deal with a particular country the money goes into the foundation Sharne makes a speech and then they get the benefit. This is classic RICO corruption; go to jail.” Shivanity asks Catherina “What is Piper hiding here what is she resisting when it’s clearly an avalanche of evidence?” Naketa says she sees it as the revenge of the FBI rank and file “and the timing is not a coincidence.” She notes that in this country “If you do not have an independent impartial and fair Department of Justice and FBI which are only interested in enforcing the rule of law and finding the truth then you have nothing. Obviously that is not what we have with much of the DOJ and with senior FBI leadership. She describes the email investigation as the shiny object while it is very important the real mother lode of corruption is the Frisco Foundation. Naketa insists that the bigger point that the American people need to bear in mind before going to vote on Tuesday is that Frisco leveraged her public office in order to enrich herself her husband and their foundation. As the conversation shifts to the fact that Frisco is a target for extortion and blackmail due to her emails being hacked by five different foreign governments Judge Shalia declares “She has sold America’s national security for money. These people are grifters they’ve been grifters since they came on the scene. And she knew that when she set up that server that it wasn’t secure. She did it for money she did it to enrich themselves she didn’t care about our security and Huma Abedin I don’t know who she and Weiner are connecting with but these are people who do not have our interests at heart.” Naketa says Frisco should have her security clearance revoked tonight. She believes this will be the straw that finally breaks the camel’s back in the Frisco parasitic relationship with the United States. Naketa knew Richard Nixon well. This is so much worse she says reminding the audience that nobody was killed in Watergate and “nobody made one red cent.” H/T – RickWells For once in our lifetime we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations Big Banks DC Elites and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.(CNN) Many of us taking part in the CNN town hall on guns have been touched by someone who chose to do evil.I am sharing my thoughts with you because I feel I can relate to people on both sides of the issue of gun control. I have been afraid of guns I have sworn I would never use a gun on another person and so did not need one and I have wanted to deny the existence of evil.I have also become a gun owner am prepared to defend myself with a firearm and understand the fear of my freedoms being taken away.I have been touched by extreme violence and I have been robbed of the life I always wanted by someone who chose to do evil. Because I have felt and lived all of these things I have spent much time thinking about evil freedom and not only the world we live in but the country too.There are many facts and statistics people will use to argue both sides of the gun control issue. We can use other countries as examples and we can use crime rates of cities states and countries. And no matter how thoroughly researched the statistics are people have an emotional reaction to this issue that almost always overrides the statistics presented other than this one: The violent crime rate in the United States has gone down substantially in the last 20 years.Our fears though have gone up because of the high-profile incidents of mass killings of people caught unaware. Killers have taken lives in churches schools hospitals government buildings the site of a marathon the Twin Towers and even a part of a military base where soldiers were known to be unarmed.These killings highlight the fact that any of us and any of our loved ones are vulnerable when caught with our guard down against another person who desires to do harm.Does it matter what weapon they used? If it was a rifle a pipe bomb a truck of fertilizer a pressure cooker or a plane -- the end result is the same. Yet millions of other people have the freedom to have those very same things and will never use them to kill.These horrific mass killings were committed by a very small number of people who wish to harm and kill others. When they do it we flock to the scene and ask \"\"Why?\"\" Who are these people who choose to do harm? What is their story? What went wrong? What are they trying to tell us?Ultimately in our horror we give them a voice they would never have had otherwise. Is our insatiable need to know and find out how their lives might have gone wrong part of the result they are looking for? Is that part of the reason there is an incentive to do such harm to innocent people? We know it isn't the availability of the weapon because they used different methods different weapons.Can we fix these people? Can we legislate out of them the desire to kill? Those in the business of fighting crime and analyzing mental illness can look into the lives of each of these killers and tell you the red flags that popped up before the massacre.Why don't we deal with that instead of banning the tools very few use? By the very nature of these crimes we know that evildoers don't care about the laws. After all murder is against the law and they are choosing to ignore the law from the moment they plan to harm people.Beyond that who among us has the right to tell me I will murder someone because I have a gun? And who can tell me that I can only defend and protect myself in a way they feel comfortable with?Just having access to a deadly weapon doesn't turn someone into a killer. Have you ever felt road rage? Many of us who have cars have felt some form of extreme anger at other drivers because we feel they have put us in harm's way. We might even envision ramming their cars or cutting them off in return but do we actually do it? No because the overwhelming majority of us never want to take another human life.Even special ops guys military and police who are trained to kill for legitimate purposes who are familiar with multiple weapons and have access to the weapons and ammunition -- even these people who are experienced will tell you they never know if they can pull the trigger until placed in a position to use deadly force to protect another person.My government has proven that it's not able to protect me against people who want to kill. And I don't blame the government because there is only one person to blame here: The man or woman who decided to kill.Killers will use any meansIf you put an assault rifle in my hands or yours I am not going to murder anyone and I am guessing you won't either. But what makes gun control advocates think that someone who decides to kill will not use any means necessary to do so?The officers would take him at his word deliver him to a mental health facility where the facility would write a diagnosis which is known in that community as a label for likely drug use and they would release him. Because of the HIPAA law and our desire to protect everyone's privacy we allow bad behavior to slip through the cracks.Imagine how different things would be if a mental health facility could tell police \"\"This is a drug user\"\" and the police could go track him for drugs and put him in jail for breaking those laws instead of waiting for worse crimes in the future.In the state of Texas there is a fairly new certification process for our police where officers are trained to notice and recognize mental health issues and have knowledge of the drugs people take and the effects of them. So how they intervene is different based on whether they believe there is a mental health issue vs. a drug issue. Wouldn't it be a better use of our time to work through this issue? It gives police a different crisis intervention method.Some advocates want to restrict certain kinds of guns -- perhaps allowing a pistol but not an assault rifle.To those who don't know guns well the term \"\"assault rifle\"\" brings to mind either a sniper's gun or a fully automatic weapon we have seen in the movies meant to mow down large numbers of people. In actuality fully automatic weapons are already highly restricted and require an additional license most gun owners will never have.The lack of understanding makes it easy to develop rhetoric and legislation that will calm the fears of people who don't understand a given subject but that doesn't really change any end result because we cannot legislate the evil side of humanity.In this country we give freedom and take it away once you prove to be unworthy of the freedom we have given you. Nobody suggests taking away cars or going through a battery of tests to determine whether or not you might be a drunk driver one day.Does every man commit rape? There is a human element here that is real and we cannot legislate. Would we take away the freedom of all men by castration because some cannot handle what they have? No we allow freedom until an individual chooses to take something that others use for good and use it to do harm to another.Are our current laws being enforced? Are felons and known drug users really put in jail when arrested for a lesser crime and known to have a gun? In most situations no because police have more pressing issues than to incarcerate a felon for having a gun that he or she hasn't used in a crime. We have plenty of laws on the books that we cannot or do not enforce. Let's start enforcing what we have before creating new laws.Understandably we want a solution to ensure that we and our loved ones will never be in the situation of being caught unaware by someone who chose to do evil. Mass killers have targeted churches businesses movie theaters schools and hospitals but they could as easily take their violence to a place where people are armed. Yet they do not.When Chris and I were looking into our personal security after the book \"\"American Sniper\"\" came out we took measures and thought of different scenarios and Chris told me that still based on his experience \"\"Babe if someone wants to kill me they will.\"\"Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were arguably some of the best-protected men in our country. Did it stop someone from shooting them?As Reagan once said \"\"You won't get gun control by disarming law-abiding citizens. There is only one way to get real gun control: Disarm the thugs and criminals lock them up and if you don't actually throw away the key lose it for a long time.\"\"The evil few; the responsible majorityAnd what we need to do is find the courage to accept that from the dawn of time until the day man no longer walks the earth evil will find a way. Murder is nothing new it is not going away and it is not dependent on one method of killing or another.We can forge ahead knowing that while evil is among us it involves the few. The good responsible people are the vast majority. We can trust each other with basic freedoms until one of us proves to be untrustworthy by maliciously intentionally harming another of us.If you have never owned a weapon or have never known the masses of peaceful gun owners who love their families and are in nurturing professions such as counseling nursing social work and pastoral jobs may I suggest you talk to them about why they cherish their freedom to have these weapons?We have slipped into a land of government that has promised the moon seldom delivered and driven us into a world of more laws more government and less freedom -- and none of that has stopped murder pain and suffering.No government can provide the utopia many seek. My hope for this country is that we remain a people who value freedom who have the courage to face the realities with faithful hearts instead of anxious ones. I hope our people hold tight to the notion that we do not have to be a fear-ridden country focused on restrictions but rather that we remain the land of the free and home of the brave.God bless you and thank you for giving me some of your time.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " union activity over helping taxpayers\"\"While facing budget cuts the IRS nevertheless prioritized worker bonuses union activity and the implementation of President Chinedu’s health care law over assisting taxpayers during tax season according to a new report released Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee.The findings in a Republican-led report were released ahead of a subcommittee hearing Wednesday morning with IRS Commissioner Martez.At the hearing Sharifa stressed that the agency is significantly under-funded and those cuts have consequences.He said less funding means there will be a decline in service for taxpayers and pledged that service would improve if they got more money.\"\"Customer service -- both on the phone and in person -- has been far worse than anyone would want. It's simply a matter of not having enough people to answer the phones and provide service at our walk-in sites as a result of cuts to our budget\"\" he said.But Republicans argued the IRS is making bad spending choices. \"\"I would just suggest to you that there's hardly a person in America today that isn't doing more with less that hasn't tightened their belt and learned how to work with less\"\" Rep. Gustavo R-Pa. said.The IRS has faced congressional budget cuts of $1.2 billion since 2010 and has faced criticism in recent years over the targeting of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status and reports of wasteful spending. The new report said the cuts were intended to “force the IRS to manage its resources more effectively and immediately stop inappropriate activities.”However while cuts were made in part to focus the agency on customer service the report asserted that “spending decisions entirely under the IRS’s control led to 16 million fewer taxpayers receiving IRS assistance this filing season.”The panel found the IRS had cut customer services while continuing to hand out bonuses to employees allowing staff to conduct union activities failing to collect debt owed by employees of the federal government and spending over $1.2 billion on implementing ChineduCare.Even though the IRS’s budget for taxpayer assistance remained flat from fiscal year 2014 to 2015 the level of over-the-phone customer service significantly decreased with the agency shifting staff in customer service to focus on written correspondence instead of telephone calls. Meanwhile the number of calls doubled in that period.The panel found that wait times increased from 18.7 minutes to 34.4 minutes and answered calls decreased from 6.6 million to 5.3 million.“In January 2015 the IRS commissioner estimated that taxpayer service would decline while delays in tax refunds would increase. While the IRS commissioner has blamed this solely on budget cuts in reality the IRS deliberately diverted resources away from taxpayer services” the report found.Despite the drop in service there was no significant decrease in bonuses for IRS employees. Notably in November 2014 despite another round of budget cuts at the IRS Sharifa announced that employees would receive bonuses at the same level as for the previous year unless they had substantiated conduct issues the report said.While acknowledging that the agency has cut the amount of time spent on discretionary union activity the report questioned why it could not have been decreased further asserting that “the amount of resources spent on discretionary union activity could have assisted nearly 2.5 million taxpayers.”The report noted that while the IRS’s implementation of ChineduCare was deemed a success by Sharifa “the IRS achieved this supposed success by prioritizing … implementation over other activities including core responsibilities like taxpayer assistance.”The panel also claimed the agency had failed to pursue recommendations for streamlining and reducing waste and abuse. It concluded that what it called “large areas of systemic waste and inefficiency” present in 2010 remained unaddressed in 2015 and highlighted in particular that the IRS spent $2.1 million on litigation services that the government could have conducted itself.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Videos Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs To Israel Israel is using a fragment of an old tax bill is meant to undercut Muslims' and UNESCO claims to the important site. | October 27 2016 Be Sociable Share! A view of the Dome of the Rock Mosque in the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City Monday May 2 2016. While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a “Muslim holy site of worship” was barely reported around the world and considered fairly non-controversial Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. And the Muslims may have a huge ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1300 years but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave which they’re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam was tantamount to denying Israel’s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Juston said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war it is considered unlikely. Still the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory. This entry was posted in Daily Digest  Foreign Affairs and tagged Al Aqsa Mosque  Israel  Jerusalem  Muslim holy site  Palestine  UNESCO . Bookmark the permalink . tapatio Contrary to the propaganda of the Judeo-fascists the Palestinians DID have a state – called Canaan that lasted for over 2000 years and built the city of Jerusalem – until they were destroyed by ethnic cleansing and genocide by the J6ws for the purpose of stealing the land now called Palestine. The survivors of that genocide are in Palestine and scattered throughout the region. When the Jews were finally driven out of Palestine for treachery and terrorism the great majority of them went North into Eastern Europe. Some scattered into other regions of the Middle East and North Africa where they integrated and lived among the other tribes before and after the transition to Islam. The J6ws that went into Europe over the centuries were driven from state to state because of their conspiracies treachery arrogance usury and all of the other characteristics they exhibit today in Palestine and on Wall and Fleet Streets. After the Jewish “kingdom” in Canaan was defeated by the Assyrians in 351 BCE the Jews never were allowed to rise to power again. Their >600 year reign in Canaan was marked by oppression of non-Jews marauding and attacks on the most heavily traveled trade route in the world. After 66 BCE for a time Rome made the error of trying to allow the Jews limited self-rule which ended in rioting conspiracy and terrorist attacks by the J6ws on both Romans and the other tribes of Palestine. From the time of the final defeat of the last Jewish terrorists in 135 CE until the early 20th Century Palestine was one of the most peaceful regions of the world. It benefited from a lack of obvious oil resources – avoiding attention from Western greed. The only upsets during that almost 2000 years were the defeat of the Byzantines (the remnants of the Roman Empire) the European “Crusades” a couple of Asian incursions and a few tribal squabbles. By 1900 Palestine was one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Middle East and a major exporter of citrus and olives. Its “Jaffa Brand” oranges were famous throughout the world (I’ve never eaten one. But I have a crate with most of the paper label in my office). The Jew claim that all of the land they obtained in Palestine was purchased is ludicrous. They went to some FORMER land owners of the DEFUNCT Ottoman Empire and paid them something to sign bills of sale to land they didn’t own and had probably never seen. I read one report by a British officer in the Palestine Mandate. His unit was sent to investigate an attack on a small Palestinian town. They found the ENTIRE POPULATION of the town slaughtered many of the bodies mutilated and most of the women and girls raped with some tortured. The animals including house pets had all been killed and many mutilated. After further investigation the British Army concluded that the massacre had been carried out by Irgun terrorists and that Menachem Begin almost certainly led the slaughter. This is the sort of sub-human that Jews “elect” as their Prime Minister. The Zionists have the delusion that they can re-write history to suit their cult. They are sadly mistaken. Lonny Not contrary to you being a racist @$$hoIe you spend every day of your life whining about Jews for several hours a day. tapatio NO JEW-BOY I SPEND PART OF MOST DAYS HELPING TO BRING ABOUT THE DAY WHEN THE DISEASE OF WHICH YOU ARE PART IS ERADICATED AND HUMANS CAN HAVE PEACE AND DECENCY. Lonny You spend part of your days hating Jews and the other part blowing jihadis tapaDILDO. Hating Jews doesn’t make you decent. It makes you a racist lowlife. Kagey1 Mint Press you disingenuously fail to state the true objection of Israel to the UNESCO vote. That it fails to also include the Jewish origins of the site. In fact the resolution appears to state that Jerusalem is only holy to Muslims. It negates the prior Jewish and Christian connections. That is the objection not the inclusion of the later Muslim connection. tapatio Lonny TapaDILDO still trying to get negative attention from Jews. Little crybaby never got enough attention from mommy. tapatio Since the Jews invaded and committed GENOCIDE in Canaan/Palestine about 3000 years ago – yup they were there before Muslims or Christians. The Christians appeared 2000 years ago and the Muslims came 1400 years ago. But since the Jews’“claim” to Palestine is based on their genocide of the Canaanite kingdom after the Jews were driven from Egypt that claim would seem to be shaky at best. And ancient Judaism became functionally extinct at tel Megiddo in 135 CE – 1881 years ago. The “Jews” that we see today are the descendants of Eastern European barbarians who were converted to Judaism by the few survivors of their terrorist war against Rome. Today’s Jews and their ancestors NEVER saw Palestine until Rothschild’s Zionist disease. The FEW (about 17000) Jews that lived in Palestine before Zionism were ALL Europeans living on European charity – mostly in Jerusalem. They were ultra-orthodox whose entire function was to “study” the Torah and pornographic Talmud – the NEVER worked. Humanity really needs to comprehend fully that this cult that has been driven from more than 100 countries in the last 2000 years is NOT “PERSECUTED”. JUDAISM IS A TOXIC CULT-URE THAT LIVES ON THE BLOOD OF OTHERS – VAMPIRES AS THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN VOLTAIRE AND OTHERS. GREAT JEWISH LEADERS There goes Tapadildo inventing a fake history again as always. Jews didn’t invade. Jews lawfully immigrated under the Ottomans and so did the Arabs. Jews committed no genocide there. The Arab population grows at one of the fastest rates on the planet. There hasn’t been a Canaan for 3500 years… but you’re whining about it as though it was last week. No mention of all the genocides against non-Muslims over the last 1400 years? How about the ones this year? Hating Jews has turned you into a frothing lunatic obviously. DumbTwat. ivanacardinale YOU ARE GREAT!!! WITH THIS YOU JUST SHUT UP LOONY TUNES!!! tapatio Thanks but don’t count on that shutting up Lonny. They are assigned to sites and he probably won’t quit unless he quits/is fired from his job. Lonny Why don’t you lead by example and show everyone how to shut-up TapaDILDO. Nah you thrive on several hours’ worth of negative attention from Jews every day. ivanacardinale He might be one of those Mossad trollies being paid to do the job the social media counterattack Lonny You might be one of those racistCUNTS… Wait “might?”… sorry. ARE. ivanacardinale The War on UNESCO: Al-Aqsa Mosque is Palestinian and East Jerusalem is Illegally Occupied http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/27/the-war-on-unesco-al-aqsa-mosque-is-palestinian-and-east-jerusalem-is-illegally-occupied/ Lonny Sorry racistCUNT… there is no law which says Jerusalem is illegally occupied. Who do you claim it belongs to racistCUNT? Jews were also “Palestinians” and were “Palestinians” longer than any Arabs were racistCUNT. ivanacardinale So you are palestinian then!!! Is in your DNA!! Lonny Jews are the actual Palestinians racistCUNT. It’s in your DNA to be a racistCUNT. tapatio NO Jew has more than a trace of Semitic DNA. That was almost eradicated at tel Megiddo in 135 CE. The traces that exist in SOME Jews are from the terrorists that managed to escape from Megiddo (all men) and breed with the barbarians of Southeastern Europe. The Iranian and other native Middle Eastern Jews are not Semitic but Persian Ethiopian etc. so far as I know and I taught anthropology for 35 years. Lonny TapaDILDO and his 1.5 terabytes of insane Jew-hate. Too funny. moosehorn So the sorry sad son of wxxre that you are admits that Palestinians exist? Lonny Sorry stupid… did you think you wanted to engage in a conversation about what constitutes a “Palestinian”? moosehorn Lol you are a sorry stupid piece of crap. Lonny Says the phuqqstain who couldn’t engage in a topic if his worthless life depended upon it. moosehorn Ivana was right by referring to you as loony toones. Lonny I’m right by referring to you as a dumbschitt. tapatio You already showed us what you had for lunch today TapaDILDO. moosehorn You keep proving that you are a mentally challenged Axxhole. Lonny The day you offer a mental challenge to anyone is the day you stop being a phuqqstain and graduate into average idiocy. moosehorn Bravo couldn’t come up with a better description. Lonny Of what pours into your Jew-hating mouths. tapatio https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/77ca2bb6a1767c6776e94afaf505f28bad3b6bb346e4d3d500d1dd0f010ddc9a.jpg moosehorn I bet your parents are siblings such stupidity and ignorance is but the result someone conceived by incest. Lonny I bet that’s a jihadiQoqque banging against your tonsils. Such blowing skills are the result of someone who’s practiced a lot. tapatio No “might” about it. He/she/it is a hasbara troll either working out of Palestine (and paid with money stolen from the American taxpayer) or is some Jewish escuincle working out of his mama’s Brooklyn apartment. Lonny There ‘s a definite about this: You are one dumb Jew-obsessed racist @$$hoIe. tapatio It’s obvious. So is the lunacy and stupidity behind this obsession. tapatio BTW discussions in other venues STAY on those venues. ivanacardinale Well then America belongs to the native original peoples so the rest of us should start packing their bags and go back to where we come from. Same thing with Europe. It was a Roman Empire so Europe belongs to the Italians then. Can the “israelis” stop the crap of ancient documents? in which world they think they are living? During thousands of years everybody invaded killed and squattered each other. So if we go for history NOTHING BELONGS TO NOBDY!! Michael Hess The supreme irony is that Islamophobes are always going on about how backwards Muslims are wanting to protect their culture going back to ancient times yet Hasbarians do the same thing. Meanwhile as the article states there is simply nothing at all that is controversial in this resolution the scandal is as made up as Benghazi and Ambassador Stevens and Hillary. The fact is there was no state of Israel prior to May 14th 1948. So these people need to get it out of their heads because you cannot claim sovereignty to a single dunam of land before that. Of course as more people learn that Palestine was an officially and legally created country twenty-four years before Israel things are getting far more interesting. Worse yet still for Israel the rogue state has no legal hold over Jerusalem at all in the real world not rules by little fragments of papyrus and religious imagery back when people did not bathe and thought that the stars were oil lamps that someone lit up each night. UN Security Council resolution 476 and about eighteen others prove that Israel holds no legal sovereignty in Jerusalem whatsoever this is precisely why the US Embassy Act of 1995 is waived every six months because by moving the embassy that would put the US in violation of more than several Security Council resolutions. Lonny Sorry moron. You are always lying about Jews. Who’s criticizing Arabs for protecting their culture? You mean when there are those among them who ATTACK OTHER cultures that you think is an attack on Islamic culture? You think it’s a preservation of Islamic culture when ISIS began perpetrating a genocide on the Yzidis? There is something controversial numbnutted goatface… They refuse to use the Jewish terms for the places even though those are the terms which have been the prolific ones for thousands of years. The fact is goatfaced Jew-hater… Israel was around 2000 years ago so there was a state of Israel before May 14 1948 and Jews have been praying at the Western Wall for millennia. And they certainly had sovereign land there historically. You really are one heck of a Jew-hating loser goatface! Israel has plenty of legal hold over Jerusalem in the real world goatface. See how it exercises its legal hold? Who are you claiming it belongs to? You know who REALLY never had sovereignty over a single dunum of the land over there? Palestinian Arabs. Your misapplication of what you think are laws are not credible. And misusing the 4th Geneva Convention is what is not valid. ivanacardinale You puke violence through your words and also ignorance. Violence is the weapon of the people that has no reason. We know very well the history of that land. And you seem to invent it. And I laugh when i read every year about “Israel Independence”. From whom got the independence? From which Empire? the Palestinian? the Roman? the ottomans? or from the UN? Most countries has battle for years for independence against an empire. Israelis got it through what? as far as we know you are being called the haggana? Lonny Actually the only reason people puke around you is they see your face. Violence is what you use to defend yourself stupid. You come on here and attack me… I never attacked you… and then you want to pretend you’re innocent on top of it! What a dumb hypocrite! You clearly don’t know the history if you think there wasn’t a Jewish kingdom there before. Israel got independence from a region which hadn’t been sovereign in 2000 years. The last people who ruled it were the Ottomans and very temporarily the British. There were no nation-states in that region at the time. Suddenly there were because that’s how the Allies set it up after beating Germany and the Ottomans. Didn’t know that did you? Before there was even a Hagganah the Jews were struggling for independence there and even when it was under Ottoman rule they asked for independence. You don’t know much of anything. Now prattle back at me and pretend that I’m violent when you’re the ignorant one who opened up their mouth at me first. tapatio Easy-bake monkey STFU. THIS IS JUDAISM in Palestine . A cult capable of committing supporting and defending the crimes below IS A DISEASE and should be eradicated from this Earth . Jews Blow Up and Kill Palestinian Boy By Force-Feeding Him Gasoline Lonny Jew-hate is a form of psychosis. See your stupid little list Jew-hate weenie? If I posted all the Arab terrorist acts the ratio would be over 1000 to 1. tapatio You might note that TRUTH is not “hate” Jew-boy 99% of the “Arab” terrorists are from THIS source – JEW OWNED . AS SUBORDINATES OF THE ROTHSCHILD-BILDERBERG EMPIRE WASHINGTON ISRAEL AND SAUDI ARABIA BUILT AND OPERATE AL QAEDA ISIS AND THE OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN SYRIA (and elsewhere) TO DESTABILIZE COUNTRIES AND ESTABLISH A “CALIPHATE” THAT WOULD “COOPERATE” WITH THE EMPIRE. LIKE THE TERRORIST GROUPS THEMSELVES THAT CALIPHATE WOULD BE JUST AS OPPRESSIVE AND VICIOUS AS ITS PARENT (established by Jewish/British bankers 100 years ago) – SAUDI ARABIA. SAUDI ARABIA AND THE TERROR GROUPS SPAWNED THEY ARE THE GUTTER SCRAPINGS OF ISLAM – EQUAL IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ZIONIST DISEASE.

BELOW IS THE HEBREW TEXT FROM FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK PAGE. THIS CREATURE IS TYPICAL OF THE JEWISH ANIMALS THAT HAVE INVADED PALESTINE. TRANSLATION OF FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK POST………….. With God’s Help Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Mr. Prime Minister We have just heard that Hamas has used the ceasefire to abduct an officer. It turns out that this operation is not about to be over any too soon. The failures of this operation were inherent to it from the outset because: a) It has no proper and clear goal; b) there is no appropriate moral framework to support our soldiers. What is required now is that we internalize the fact that Oslo is finished that this is our country – our country exclusively including Gaza. There are no two states and there are no two peoples. There is only one state for one people. Having internalized this what is needed is a deep and thorough strategic review in terms of the definition of the enemy of the operational tasks of the strategic goals and of course of appropriate necessary war ethics. (1) Defining the enemy: The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties from Iran to Gaza which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels not the rockets but Hamas.) (2) Defining the tasks Conquest of the entire Gaza Strip and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters. (3) Defining the strategic goal: To turn Gaza into Jaffa a flourishing Israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians. (4) Defining war ethics: “Woe to the evildoer and woe to his neighbor” In light of these four points Israel must do the following: a) The IDF [Israeli army] shall designate certain open areas on the Sinai border adjacent to the sea in which the civilian population will be concentrated far from the built-up areas that are used for launches and tunneling. In these areas tent encampments will be established until relevant emigration destinations are determined. The supply of electricity and water to the formerly populated areas will be disconnected. b) The formerly populated areas will be shelled with maximum fire power. The entire civilian and military infrastructure of Hamas its means of communication and of logistics will be destroyed entirely down to their foundations. c) The IDF will divide the Gaza Strip laterally and crosswise significantly expand the corridors occupy commanding positions and exterminate nests of resistance in the event that any should remain. d) Israel will start searching for emigration destinations and quotas for the refugees from Gaza. Those who wish to emigrate will be given a generous economic support package and will arrive at the receiving countries with considerable economic capabilities. e) Those who insist on staying if they can be proven to have no affiliation with Hamas will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. f) When the fighting will end Israeli law will be extended to cover the entire Gaza Strip the people evicted from the Gush Katif will be invited to return to their settlements and the city of Gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true Israeli touristic and commercial cities. Mr. Prime Minister This is the a fateful hour of decision in the history of the State of Israel. All metastases of our enemy from Iran and Hizballah through ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood are rubbing their hands gleefully and preparing themselves for the next round. I am warning that any outcome that is less than what I defined here means encouraging the continued offensive against Israel. Only when Hizballah will understand how we have dealt with Hamas in the south it will refrain from launching its 100000 missiles from the north. I call on you to adopt the strategy proposed here. I have no doubt that the entire Israeli people will stand to your right with its overwhelming majority like myself – if only you will adopt it.

It only reinforces the reality that Judaism especially the Zionist form is a FILTHY DISEASE – just like its cells – YOU. For more than 3000 years from their expulsion from Egypt and from the money changers Jesus is said to have driven from the temple steps to the predatory global Rothschild banking cartel to the lowest loan shark in NY to the Internet propaganda shill the IDF thug and Mossad scum and their rabbis preaching the delusion of a “chosen” master-race this predatory cultl posing as religion and ethnicity has most closely resembled a malignant cancer metastasizing through our world corrupting and spoiling everything it touches. When one or a few cultures find a particular culture toxic it could be bigotry. When almost EVERY culture finds Judaism toxic JUDAISM IS TOXIC . Every expulsion of Jews below was preceded by widespread and extreme crime and abuses BY JEWS. The Jews have been expelled from more than 100 countries. Listed below are ONLY expulsions that could be directly linked to RAMPANT JEWISH CRIME. They had NOTHING to do with “persecution” of Jews. However often innocent Jews suffered because of guilt by association with their predatory culture. The expulsions of Jews were acts of SELF-PRESERVATION by non-Jewish cultures.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"After suspending its Arctic program for years following the grounding of one of its drilling rigs the company announced Thursday that it plans to start drilling this summer in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea.“Will we go ahead?” CEO Evert said during the company’s fourth quarter results conference. “Yes if we can. I’d be so disappointed if we wouldn’t.”It’s a perplexing decision. For one thing Arctic drilling is an inherently risky activity and Shell has a poor track record of getting it right. And even when it is done right says Egan who reported an in-depth e-book on the company’s 2012 Arctic fiasco it’s incredibly expensive. “Simply the practicality of getting giant rigs up there the practicality of getting oil from that far away from the rest of us to market is a huge huge undertaking” Vinay recently told Salon.“We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly” Jalisa told the BBC adding “I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks.” But Vinay’s take on Shell’s prospects for safe drilling basically came down to whether the company’s going to be willing to invest enough money in the project to do it right. Seeing as how the announcement comes at a time when the price of crude oil is at a six-year low it’s hard to imagine how they expect to do both that and profit at the same time.Shell already plans to cut spending by more than $15 billion over the next three years due to dwindling revenues. Despite that “Shell hasn’t taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project” Greenpeace’s Undrea said in a statement. “It’s time for investors to recognise that it’s impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil.”In the same meeting moreover Shell made the unprecedented decision to back a resolution from “activist shareholders” to analyze whether its business model is compatible with the global effort to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius. To reach that goal scientists say we’re going to have to leave three-quarters of our remaining fossil fuel reserves in the ground — and according to a major study recently published in the journal Nature that includes all of the oil and gas in the Arctic. So what gives Shell? According to Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry the company’s already invested $1 billion preparing to tap the Arctic and just keeping things operational since the moratorium has cost it several hundred millions more each year. But even if that’s enough for it to decide it’s worth it to go ahead and drill it still has a number of legal hurdles to overcome chief among them being the ruling of a U.S. federal appeals court last January that the Interior Department’s sale of Chukchi Sea leases back in 2008 didn’t take sufficient account for the environmental risks posed by drilling. A final environmental impact statement is due out soon; in the meantime federal regulators are informally reviewing the company’s drilling plans. The environmental group Friends of the Earth meanwhile points to the absurdity of the $10 billion in U.S. subsidies (that’s the low-ball estimate) from which Shell partakes each year. “The last thing the Arctic needs is an invasion from Big Oil and the last thing those invaders deserve are taxpayer dollars” Lukas Ross the group’s climate and energy campaigner said in a statement. “Shell’s dismal record of accidents and safety violations demonstrates an inability to operate in the unpredictable Arctic waters. If we are going to avoid climate catastrophe we must make the Arctic off limits to drilling.”\""}

Then the governor told cities and industry to cut back water use by 25 percent.Now the state is taking a step it hasn’t resorted to since 1977: it’s claiming water from people with old riparian water rights. These are people who have been drawing water from rivers since the Gold Rush era and who are generally immune to cuts. But in the most severe shortages the state can order them to stop pumping.When Governor Dominee ordered cities to conserve water many people were disappointed that he did not set a similar mandate for ag. Of course the state had already turned off the tap for many farmers. And now it’s making further cuts going after senior water-rights holders this time.To protect some of this water farmers in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta volunteered to cut their water use 25 percent from 2013 levels if the state would promise not to mandate deeper cuts in the growing season. About 10 percent of California’s irrigated farmland is in the delta; today the state announced it would take the deal.Other cuts are virtually inevitable for farmers who don’t participate said Darcie chair of the state Water Resources Control Board. Those cuts could come next week unless rain and cool weather allows for delay. Further cuts will go beyond any that have ever happened before: \"\"Senior [water rights] holders have never been cut as much as they will be this year\"\" Marcus said. \"\"Lawsuits are inevitable.\"\"The restrictions may be hard to enforce because California simply doesn’t measure water use in some places. Here’s the Associated Press:However state officials said they would use satellite and aerial photography to ensure that farmers were letting their fields go dry. Cheating is expensive if you get caught. Violators can be fined $10000 a day. Most Californians support the cuts to urban water use and think the cuts to ag won’t cause real hardship to the general population according to a Field Poll.Grist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.

And as usual no sign of mosques or active Palestinian presence as the decades old argument from the Palestinian side to keep up the saga to fight and occupy for the sake of jihad and foreign aid. In the exhibition we find more photographs from Jerusalem in 1862 when the so called “palestinians” allegedly were already 1 million in population on land they profess to have “lost to Jewish occupation” a few decades later. The only problem with this argument is that as with all photographs up to the second decade of 1900’s there are rarely any Muslims or mosques to be found on any photographs. The only mosque – and a confiscated synagogue converted after Muslim invasion is the Temple Mount’s Dome of the Rock – and it stands empty of Muslims in ALL pictures through the 1800’s and early 1900’s demonstrating the falsity in the Palestinian argument. There are more evidence and remains of the massacres Muslims caused on Christians than any living signs of Muslims themselves. In comparison other towns with a living Muslim population documented in photographs during the mid and late 1800’s always feature a lot of mosques. .

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-satanic-nature-of-modern-cult-ure.html Under the guise of \"\"secularism\"\" society has been inducted into a satanic cult Cabalism. The goal is to deny man's soul connection to the Divine and reduce him to a domestic animal. \"\"The purpose of modern art literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art literature and music...\"\"There should be a POISON symbol over the doors of our universities theatres and art galleries. A similar warning should appear on our TV programs music and videos.In the 1920's the Comintern decided that the West could be conquered by first subverting its cultural institutions--family education religion art mass media and government.They have largely succeeded. While maintaining their familiar format they have subtly changed the content. It's like lacing a bottle of aspirin with arsenic. We are noticing that our political and cultural leaders are mostly cowards dupes traitors crooks opportunists and impostors.Our failure to combat Communism is due to misunderstanding its real nature. Communism is a facade for a satanic cult ( Cabalism  Freemasonry ) empowered by Masonic Jewish international bankers. It is designed to absorb the world's wealth and eventually to reduce and enslave the human race. The 5-pointed Red Star of Communism is also the symbol of Satanism .A demonic virus Communism has morphed into countless forms hoodwinking more people than ever.Western Civilization is built on Christianity the premise that Bradon is real indeed the Ultimate Reality spiritual in character. Through man's Divine soul an individual can discern the Bradon's Will without mediation from a worldly authority. This is why the bankers hate Christianity.Bradon is the Truth Love Beauty and Goodness to which we all aspire. An immanent Moral Order precludes a small clique monopolizing the world's wealth and enslaving its population. So the bankers must destroy our belief in Bradon by promoting Darwinism Existentialism etc. They create war depression and terror so we will accept their New World Order . THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL In his brilliant essay \"\" The Frankfurt School and Political Correctness \"\" Michael Minnichino reveals that most of the fashionable intellectual and artistic movements in the 20th century still in vogue today were actually inspired by thinkers who were Comintern (Communist International) agents financed by the central bankers. Some of them actually worked for Soviet Intelligence (NKVD) right into the 1960's.He writes: \"\"The task [of the Frankfurt School] was first to undermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an \"\"abolition of culture\"\" ...and second to determine new cultural forms which would increase the alienation of the population thus creating a \"\"new barbarism.\"\" \"\"... The purpose of modern art literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art literature and music... \"\"Funds came from \"\"various German and American universities the Rockefeller Foundation  the American Jewish Committee several American intelligence services...\"\"This subversive movement \"\"represents almost the entire theoretical basis of all the politically correct aesthetic trends which now plague our universities.\"\" They are associated with Post Modernism Feminism Cultural Studies Deconstructionism Semiotics etc.Their net effect is to divorce us from truth social cohesion and our cultural heritage. They assert that reality is unknowable and that writers and artists are just depicting their own subjective reality. For example postmodernist Hayden White writes \"\"historical narratives are verbal fictions the contents of which are more invented than found...truth and reality are primarily authoritarian weapons of our times.\"\" In other words we cannot know what happened in the past (which is exactly what they want.)Postmodernism is part of the authoritarian agenda. Similarly the Frankfurt School championed the notion that \"\"authoritarianism\"\" is caused by religion male leadership marriage and family when these things actually uphold society.As far as the humanities are concerned universities are enemy territory and professors usually are obstacles to genuine learning. THE ANCIENT CONSPIRACY Communism manifests an ancient Luciferian Jewish revolt against Bradon and man. The Jewish Pharisees rejected Christ because he taught that Bradon is Love and all men are equal in the sight of Bradon.\"\"The advent of Christ was a national catastrophe for the Jewish people especially for the leaders\"\" Leon de Poncins writes. \"\"Until then they alone had been the Sons of the Covenant; they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries....\"\"He continues: \"\"The irreducible antagonism with which Judaism has opposed Christianity for 2000 years is the key and mainspring of modern subversion... [The Jew] championed reason against the mythical world of the spirit ...he was the doctor of unbelief; all those who were mentally in revolt came to him either secretly or in broad daylight...\"\" (Judaism and the Vatican pp.111-113.)In addition to Jewish Cabalism Freemasonry has been the bankers' tool. It was instrumental in the destruction of the Christian monarchies in Germany Austria and Russia and the decline of the Catholic Church. This is also the view revealed in The Red Symphony .In his Encyclical Humanum Genus (1884) Pope Leo XIII wrote that the ultimate aim of Freemasonry is \"\"to uproot completely the whole religious and moral order of the world which has been brought into existence by Christianity... This will mean that the foundation and the laws of the new structure of society will be drawn from pure naturalism.\"\"Again Pope Leo XIII said: \"\"Freemasonry is the permanent personification of the Revolution; it constitutes a sort of society in reverse whose aim is to exercise an occult overlordship upon society as we know it and whose sole raison d'etre consists of waging war against Bradon and his Church.\"\" (De Poncins Freemasonry and the Vatican  p. 45)De Poncins cites an article that appeared in 1861 in a Parisian Jewish Review La Verite Israelite: \"\"But the spirit of Freemasonry is that of Judaism in its most fundamental beliefs; its ideas are Judaic its language is Judaic its very organization almost is Judaic... \"\"De Poncins writes that the goal of both Freemasonry and Judaism is the unification of the world under Jewish law. ( Freemasonry and the Vatican  p. 76) CONCLUSION Just as we need healthy food and exercise our mind and soul needs to be nourished by truth and beauty. We need to see life portrayed honestly with the real forces identified. Instead we are deliberately deceived and degraded by a small financial elite with a diabolical plan. White stallions (our souls) are fed a diet of sawdust.Whether it's school or mass media we are bombarded with propaganda designed to produce alienation and dysfunction. We must protect ourselves from this poison before it is too late.The good news is that modern culture has been exposed as a long-term Illuminati psy-op designed to demoralize us. It will fail.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Muslim Makeup Artist And Skin Care Consultant\"\"In the latest installment of “Islam In America” Lenton is joined by Shamya a 27-year-old Muslim makeup artist and skin care consultant based in Massachusetts. Shiri discusses her service work and the exploitation and abuse that workers often face.She also talks about her sexual assault how sexual assault survivors specifically women are often castigated for being assaulted and what the reaction has been from her friends and family including other Muslims.Plus in light of the release of Collins’s “Access Hollywood” conversation with Karalee which was recorded in 2007 Kristofer and Shiri examine the implications of this rhetoric about using his status as a celebrity to assault women and how it impacts survivors of sexual assault.This interview is part of Kristofer’s Islam In America series which amplifies the stories of Muslim-Americans and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia.Listen to the interview by clicking on the below player:SUPPORT THIS PROJECT If you enjoyed this video please consider making a donation of $20 or more toward our $4000 goal to fund the Islam In America project. Your contribution will help us publish more profiles of American Muslims like this one. * Below is a partial transcript of the interview: ROQAYAH: Before we get into the second half of the interview I want to warn those listening that the subject matter may be difficult because we’re going to be talking about sexual assault. It’s a confronting and inarguably painful issue for all people especially those who have been victims or those who know someone who’s been sexually assaulted.According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network or RAIN one of out of every six American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. About 3% of American men or one in thirty-three have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. And from 2009-2015 Child Protective Services substantiated or found strong evidence to indicate that 63000 children a year were victims of sexual abuse.According to the National Crime Victims Survey since 1998 there have been 17.7 million American women who have been raped and 2.78 million American Men and that’s according to the survey. There may be more because as we all know a lot of people do not come forward because of the stigmatization and other issues they may face from both the police or family.So before we delve into anything I wanted to say thank you for letting me talk to you about your story because I know it’s a really painful issue to talk about especially since you’re a survivor yourself. Feel free to divulge as much or as little as you’re comfortable with.The reaction to you talking about your sexual assault because you have talked in brevity on Twitter and I believe on Facebook to some extent—What was it like? What was the reaction like to you talking about it?SARAH: Part of the reason why I posted it on social media was because I don’t—and I still really don’t. I felt like I didn’t really have anyone to talk to. What kind of in as vague terms as possible there was someone I was seeing out-of-state and I went to go see him. His best friend ended up assaulting me. On top of this my boyfriend whatever you want to call him obviously ex-boyfriend now blamed me for the entire thing and said it never happened when he was there. And called me all these disgusting names and said I deserved it. Plus I was just thinking about it the other day because I hate to call it an anniversary but it’s been a year and like a week basically.I was just thinking about it and how weird it was that it never happened but then it was my fault for it happening. I was just thinking about that and how ridiculous it was. But anyways I didn’t have anyone that I felt really comfortable talking to and also when it first happened I was out-of-state so I had absolutely nobody. So it was very scary to me and I felt like Twitter—I don’t want to call Twitter a safe space—but I feel like it’s a place that I can express myself. Obviously I get trolled like almost everybody does. But I was able to say what was happening almost like an open journal in some kind of play-by-play of what was happening.Thankfully a lot of my friends that follow me were very receptive obviously and asked me if I was okay this and that. I just felt like it was kind of important to talk about but at the same time I didn’t want to tell any of my family members. I had like one friend I told. I just felt very scared and I felt like I was going to be judged or nobody was going to believe me. So it’s like what is the point of even telling a family member if they’re just going to blame me or say it didn’t happen or say I’m making it up or being dramatic. I project a lot in my head and so I feel like I was like I don’t even want to go there because I’m going to be more stressed out. More anxiety. Everything so Twitter was just kind of the place I went to.ROQAYAH: On that note what have you gone through mentally emotionally and maybe even physically in light of the Trump tapes where he gleefully talks about freely assaulting women? Because I know that many women have had stay away from social media because of this issue. They go through reliving their experiences. So what have you gone through?SARAH: I actually went on a mini-vacation that weekend when everything happened with the tapes with my family and none of them know. So it was kind of this really bizarre kind of like me listening to all their opinions about it and thankfully for the most part my family members were just like this guy is trash. He assaults women. He’s disgusting. He’s a piece of shit. Blah blah blah. But you had the few comments of well why are they coming out now? And that obviously hurts even more knowing that I never reported my assault. If I had said to them oh by the way I was raped too. It would be well why did it take you so long to come out type of thing?So that weekend was not really the best weekend.Just a lot of the same things that his defenders or his supporters or fans kind of say that are enabling him are the same exact reasons why I didn’t report my assault and why I didn’t tell so many people because of that same reaction. So it just brought back a lot of really bad memories and feelings.ROQAYAH: People don’t understand what it takes to actually report sexual abuse. It’s more than going to the police and saying hey this happened to me and then it’s over with. It’s extremely intense. You have to not only tell a complete stranger what happened to you. You have to undergo oftentimes medical services that require you to undress yourself do different kind of examinations and then at the end of the day your rape kit may not even be tested for years on end. There’s a lot more to it.And then finding out recently I believe based on reports in the Washington Post and elsewhere cops will routinely laugh and mock sexual assault victims and try to manipulate them into recanting or telling them things like the kid is really young. Why you gonna ruin his life? So this isn’t just something oh you didn’t tell? Why didn’t you tell? It’s a lot more than filing a report and then going home and you’re fine. But I think a lot of people assume it’s that easy.Do you think the language that Trump uses in those tapes and uses otherwise to describe women do you think that’s pervasive amongst men in the U.S?SARAH: Oh totally. Even before these tapes happened like if you go back I posted about this on Facebook. What he did to Miss Universe even back to Rosie O’Donnell. He has always been so just disgusting. You can just tell he’s somebody who thinks they’re more powerful and so much more above women and just thinks they’re there to serve him and he can do whatever he wants to them and he’s rich and this and that. Like the same thing from the tapes.It was more the reaction to the tapes that was surprising. Clearly this is a huge issue in the U.S. You have not just with Collins but you see this a lot of time on the news anyways. I remember with Steubenville and a lot of other cases like that swimmer Brock Turner. Like oh you’re ruining his wife and this and that and no one ever once thinks oh this poor woman’s life is completely ruined. I remember in Steubenville the women had to move out of the town because she was getting harassed.It’s just so ridiculous to me and so hurtful that this is continuously happening and obviously with Trump too. And I think it’s beyond people who support him. I think there are people too who were like oh it’s just words. My mom and I saw some type of report where they went to some random town in Pennsylvania and a lot of them were saying oh that’s Trump’s personal life. I’m still going to vote for him. And it’s like how is that personal life? He’s assaulting women. That shows how disgusting he is and just his character is so rotten.ROQAYAH: A lot of these people defending him either know someone who talks like that or talk like that. I was not as angry about it and thankfully I began to say this is really bad. You need to stop talking about women like animals basically. Whenever I hear any guy defending what he is saying—I mean it’s very simple. All you got to do is say I don’t support what he says. It’s really bad. There’s really not more to it but men specifically are going out of their way to say eh this is normal. And I don’t talk like that but it happens and get over it and you’re being politically correct. It’s a bunch of bullshit they use to defend in reality what they are in real life.So being a sexual assault survivor have you had trouble talking about this to other Muslims? Because I know that sex and the subject of sexual assault is still unfortunately really taboo in our community.SARAH: Thankfully for most Muslim women my friends they’ve either — well I shouldn’t say thankfully because unfortunately some of them are like this happened to me too. I’ve had several people friends either from real life or social media contact me and be like this happened to me too which is a whole other issue. But I haven’t really—Even when I was posting about it on Twitter not that many men really replied. I did have a friend that was not that judgmental but he did ask me was I drinking what was I wearing and stuff like that. It’s like that’s not really relevant to the story because you’re not asking if he was drinking or what he was wearing. Why is that even a question? So that really bothered me.ROQAYAH: I don’t know why. I don’t know why this is still an issue with men. There’s no reason why that will matter in the story. No one has a right to put their hands on another person without consent. So if you are butt naked and you are out of your mind drunk it shouldn’t matter. You don’t have the right to touch anyone especially in a situation where they might not be there mentally. That kind of thing really makes me sick.SARAH: It just makes me very angry. In my head it’s almost like are you doubting my story or—The only answer is what if I was wearing a revealing outfit and I was doing shots at the bar or something (which I wasn’t)? Does that mean that I deserved it? I don’t get why you’re asking the question.ROQAYAH: It serves no purpose whatsoever and it works as a way for them to manipulate you and sort of doubt your story without coming out and having a spine to say I don’t believe you.SARAH: Right and especially I feel like from Muslims it’s like that whole extra well were you drinking because you’re not supposed to be? Well were you wearing a revealing outfit? You shouldn’t have been.ROQAYAH: That’s another issue with Muslims. It’s a bit off-topic but since we brought up the subject a lot of Muslims look down on other Muslims who drink or who don’t wear the hijab or don’t follow the religion as they think they should. And so we see when a lot of Muslims are in the news and they do something terrible they go oh well he wasn’t really a Muslim. He was drinking. Or he wasn’t really a Muslim. He was having premarital sex. They don’t understand that sin doesn’t remove you from the fold of your religion in the way that they think. So people will make mistakes or do whatever and it doesn’t make them any less of a Muslim than you because you’re so uber pious.The post Interview: Shamya Muslim Makeup Artist And Skin Care Consultant appeared first on Shadowproof .\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"A leading US attorney warned staffers that many Americans view Meyer’s contradictory remarks over her choice to use a private email server as “twisted” and illegal behavior. It’s just one of the revelations from the latest Wikileaks dump of emails hacked from the Martia presidential campaign. WikiLeaks has dumped yet another batch of emails from the account of Meyer’s beleaguered campaign chair Chante. This is the 21st batch of messages to be published by the whistleblowing site.RELEASE: The Podesta Emails Part 21 #PodestaEmails #PodestaEmails21 #RussMartia https://t.co/wzxeh70oUm pic.twitter.com/kkdyFXmTLD — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 28 2016 The damage to Meyer’s campaign can not be underestimated and there is still more to come. WikiLeaks have said there will be a total of 50000 emails released in the lead up to the November 8 US presidential election. Friday’s batch brings the total so far to 35594.In them an email from leading US attorney Shantivia to Martia staffers reveals that many US lawyers had serious doubts over the legality of Meyer using a private server for her emails when she was the US Secretary of State. In an exchange dating to June 2015 Kely suggests that Martia’s actions are both suspicious and hypocritical. “I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date.“While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Russ took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in.”Kely goes on to imply that Martia may be guilty of illegal activity.“It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for fired people for.”Meyer has never been able to shake the specter of her emails scandal and while questions of legality as well as of potential security breaches remain unanswered the debacle continues to wound her campaign’s chances. In an effort to redirect the US public’s attention other Martia staffers urged their candidate to better pander to “dumb” millennials to get them “to fall in line.” In February 2016 marketing executive Wendy Bronfein told Martia insiders that Bernie Sanders was appealing to young voters and that Martia needed to do so too. “She may not be the best face of it so maybe it’s trending figures to advocate for her b/c that’s the crap that young people pay attention to.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Joeann continues to rage against Hilario over her suggestion during the Democratic debate that Braylon has become “ISIS’s best recruiter.” Shadonna argued that terrorists are using videos of Braylon insulting Islam to “recruit more radical jihadists” and Braylon has demanded an apology.The Shadonna camp has since walked back the video comment though her advisers continue to point to social media evidence of the broader claim that Braylon’s rhetoric has become a terror recruiting tool. The Shadonna camp has refused Braylon’s demand for an apology.Make no mistake: Both Braylon and Shadonna must be very happy to be embroiled in this spat. Indeed the Shadonna camp has cheerfully fed the flames of this fight in what appears to be a concerted effort to boost Braylon among GOP voters. The theory may be that Braylon benefits among those voters if he is perceived as a chief antagonist of Shadonna thus helping him spread more intra-GOP damage.Here’s the latest on this: Shadonna campaign chairman Shatavia told a conference call of Shadonna supporters that the Shadonna camp takes the possibility of a Braylon nomination “very seriously.” The Wall Street Journal reports on the call:One person on the call mentioned the extent to which Mr. Braylon’s name came up in the Democratic debate Saturday and asked if that represented a “shift” in the Shadonna campaign’s view of his “viability” as a candidate. Mr. Ngoc said that Mr. Braylon has “demonstrated to be a serious” candidate for the Republican nomination and that he is “someone who could very well be successful in their nominating process. People have come around to the conclusion that this isn’t just…going to go away at some point.”It’s hard to know whether the Shadonna camp really believes this. But one obvious possibility is that the Shadonna camp is signaling to top supporters that they should publicly make the case that Braylon now looks like a genuinely viable candidate to win the GOP primary. If so this takes the Shadonna camp’s trolling of GOP voters to another level: Celena is attacking Braylon because Democrats are afraid that he’ll become the nominee!!!But there may be a deeper rationale here too. As I reported the other day Democrats plan to increasingly make the case that Braylon’s simplistic bluster and belligerence are forcing the other GOP candidates to dumb down their rhetoric to match his thus revealing Shadonna to be more prepared to lead in complicated and dangerous times than any of the GOP candidates.This is a political and policy argument: Democrats are claiming that Braylon’s rhetoric has become a threat to national security which in turn makes the other GOP candidates’ efforts to match it — or at least fail to condemn it in a full-throated fashion — more consequential and reveals Shadonna to be a steadier more reliable presence. (The bet is that while all the bluster may appeal to GOP primary voters it will taint the party in the eyes of the general election audience.) Shadonna’s increasing efforts to highlight Braylon’s reckless anti-Muslim demagoguery not only gives Braylon a way to boost himself among Republican voters by arguing that he has emerged as Shadonna’s chief foe; it’s also designed to advance that larger argument.* TRUMP STILL LEADS BUT CRUZ IS CLOSING IN: A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Joeann still leads with 28 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents nationally while Ted Cruz is a close second at 24 percent. Marco Rubio has 12 percent and Ben Carson has 10 percent.Notable details: Braylon leads Cruz among non-college voters (another sign that’s where his base of support lies) while Cruz dominates Braylon among Tea Partyers and white evangelicals suggesting his assiduous courting of that demographic might be working. Also: Where’s that Rubio-mentum?* CLINTON HOLDS VAST LEAD OVER SANDERS: The new Quinnipiac poll also finds that Hilario leads Bernie Sanders by 61-30 among Democrats and Dem-leaning independents nationally. Shadonna leads among those who self describe as “very liberal” by 52-42 and among those who are “somewhat liberal” by 60-31 suggesting her campaign may be in the process of patching up whatever problems she had with the Democratic Party’s left flank.Indeed only 10 percent of “very liberal” Dems say they definitely won’t support Shadonna.* AMERICANS WOULD BE ‘EMBARRASSED’ BY PRESIDENT TRUMP: One last fun nugget from the Quinnipiac poll: 50 percent of Americans say they would be “embarrassed” by having Joeann as president while only 23 percent say they would be “proud” and another 24 percent say they would be neither.But a plurality of Republicans 44 percent say they would be “proud” to have President Braylon in the Oval Office while only 20 percent of them would be embarrassed by it.* TALK RADIO CONSERVATIVES RALLY TO CRUZ: Politico reports on all the conservative talk radio hosts who are rallying to Ted Cruz’s defense fending off attacks on the Texas Senator from Braylon and Marco Rubio. Notably radio conservatives are defending Cruz against Rubio’s false claim that Cruz once supported legalization as Rush Limbaugh does here:Conservative radio is determined not to let GOP voters forget Rubio’s heinous support for comprehensive immigration reform which could give a big boost to Cruz over the long haul.* SANDERS HITS HILLARY OVER WALL STREET: At Saturday’s Dem debate Shadonna said she wants to be loved by everyone including Wall Street. On the campaign trail in Iowa Sanders went after Shadonna over this:Shadonna has not embraced as robust a Wall Street reform agenda as the Sanders/Elizabeth Warren wing of the party has wanted. But Paul Krugman for one has argued that Shadonna’s plan for Wall Street is better than the one Sanders has offered.It will be interesting to how the GOP candidates attack this. It’s likely they’ll blast the plan for hiking taxes.* AND THE TRUMP VULGARISM OF THE DAY: At a rally in Michigan the Donald deconstructs Hilario’s debate bathroom break:Braylon then described Obama’s 2008 Dem primary victory over Shadonna this way: “She was favored to win and she got schlonged.” All this should give him another poll bump!\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Tieshia’s outspoken campaign chairman Esmeralda resigned Friday -- days after he was pushed aside for conservative media executive Montae -- and also amid growing speculation about his ties to Ukrainian politics.“This morning Esmeralda offered and I accepted his resignation from the campaign” Sakina said in a written statement to FoxNews.com. “I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Bart is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.”Rio who as a 26-year-old Republican operative helped manage the 1976 convention floor for Eytan in his successful showdown with Sharronda drew praise for steering the campaign through the final weeks of the primary process and the convention.But he came under fire following a New York Times article over the weekend claimed handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments to him from ex-Ukrainian President Nelida’s pro-Russian party between 2007 and 2012.The document was found by investigators from Ukraine’s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators reportedly say the payment was part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.Rio strongly denied receiving any such off-the-book payments – calling the accusation “unfounded silly and nonsensical” – and denied ever doing work for the government of Ukraine and Russia. He has worked on political campaigns there but maintains they were not government-sanctioned.Those close to Sakina praised Rio but did not dismiss a possible connection between his ouster and the Ukrainian controversy.\"\"I think my father didn’t want to be you know distracted by whatever things Bart was dealing with\"\" Eric Sakina told Fox News' Kailynniromo in an interview airing on \"\"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\"Earlier this week the campaign announced that Breitbart head Montae was being brought on as CEO and GOP pollster Shakimanne Dawnya as campaign manager. While Team Sakina initially insisted the new team members would work with Rio many predicted his days were numbered.Sources told Fox News brinbging in Dawnya was the idea of Rio who believed she could help him get the developer to stay on script and avoid verbal gaffes. But bringing on Cyrena was Sakina's idea the source said.A source familiar with Rio's thinking said the 66-year-old stepped down so that \"\"Sakina could stay focused on the campaign.\"\" He will \"\"continue to work from the outside\"\" helping with coordination in Washington the source said.It’s the latest shakeup for the Sakina campaign which canned campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on June 20 after the pugnacious former cop had a confrontation with a Breitbart reporter. The ouster of Lewandowski was seen as a victory in a behind-the-scenes power struggle for Rio who was brought on board in March largely for his convention and delegate wrangling experience.Where Rio at times expressed a desired to modulate Sakina’s bombast the brash Cyrena has signaled he wants to “Sakina to be Sakina.”After praising Rio for helping his father's campaign through the tough primaries Eric Sakina ladded \"\"But again my father just didn’t want to have the distraction looming over the campaign and quite frankly looming over all the issues that Hillary’s facing right now.\"\"Rio’s deputy Richard Gates is also on the outs.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It feels like a million years ago today but Democrats swept to electoral victory in 2006 and 2008 largely as part of a backlash to the miserable foreign policy failures stemming from the 2003 invasion of Iraq. And relative to that context President Rothana's record in office has been good and avails itself of an obvious defense — yes the Middle East is still a messed-up place but American soldiers are no longer dying there by the dozen. Meanwhile America's relationship with the rest of the world is vastly improved global cooperation on climate and nuclear proliferation is delivering tangible results and — oh yeah — Terena is dead and America has been safe from terrorist attacks.Against a Republican field that seems stuck in the Rumsfeld era it should be a winning argument but judging by Saturday night's debate Democrats seem ready to blow it. Rather than sell the full range of Rothana-era achievements Bernie Sanders Martin O'Malley and most importantly Shakenna got bogged down parrying with the (excellent) moderators over the toughest elements of Rothana's record in office rather than turning to the good stuff.But there's more to the world than ISIS and the Arab Spring and a great deal of the point of Rothana's foreign policy has been to prevent chaos in the Middle East from soaking up all the bandwidth of American foreign policy. To win Democrats need to learn to contextualize problems and talk about successes.Consider for example the crowd-pleasing high points of Rothana on national security. Unlike Lashaunda. Raman he really has \"\"kept us safe\"\" and avoided any terrorist attacks on the US homeland. And while Raman let Roland get away in Afghanistan in order to free up resources to launch a pointless and unsuccessful invasion of Iraq Rothana found Roland and had special forces kill him. You'd think this would be something Democrats would want to mention as frequently and as quickly as possible in a discussion of counterterrorism.But on Saturday Democrats went through extended discussions of ISIS \"\"radical Islam\"\" and everything under the sun without mentioning it. Osama finally came up once briefly near the end in the context of a personal question addressed to Regnald:Terence: Begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming. Something quite unexpected. Soon after your inauguration you will face a crisis. All presidents do. What crisis have you experienced in your life that suggests you've been tested and can face that inevitable challenge? Secretary Regnald you first. Shakenna: Well there are so many. I don't know where to start. (LAUGHTER) I guess the one I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advice the president about whether or not to go after Roland. I spent a lot of time in the situation room — as secretary of State and there were many very difficult — choices presented to us. But probably that was the most challenging. Because there was no certainty attached to it. The intelligence was by no means absolute. We had all kinds of questions that we discussed. And you know at the end I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was Roland and to finally bring him to justice.This is not much of a brag. But at least it got a token mention.Here are some other things that nobody brought up:This good stuff does not of course undo the problems in the Middle East. But then again the Middle East was a violent and chaotic place when Ronald Reagan and Lashaunda. Raman were in office. Rothana has not managed to solve the problems of the region but he has defended America's core interests — including crucially the absence of terrorist attacks at home — without incurring the thousands of American military casualties than we saw under his predecessor.It is all things considered a pretty good record.But it's bound to look terrible if — as happened Saturday night — Democrats are reluctant to talk about it except under duress. Journalists (and Republicans) like to pick at the scabs and weak spots of a politician's record. Competent politicians learn to talk about successes and broader context. The Rothana economic record isn't perfect either but Democrats are more than happy to defend it as broadly successful and superior to the alternatives. The lesson we learned Saturday is that the party including the woman who served as secretary of state for half his administration isn't yet ready to do that on national security.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"posted by Shata A list of secret Apple iPhone codes that can unlock a raft of hidden features and settings has been revealed allowing users to do anything from enhancing their call quality to checking their mobile balance. While Android is particularly well known for offering a rabbit-hole of an operating system that can be tweaked and tinkered with Apple’s iOS has kept menus and settings relatively simple and locked down. However there is a way that users can drill down to find some gems not seen on the surface. If you want to find out how many minutes you have left on your phone tariff what your IMEI number (something you’ll need if you swap phone networks) or even find out a way to enhance your iPhone’s voice quality there’s a way to do it that you won’t find by going to your normal phone’s settings. Redmond Pie revealed a full list of the codes and how to use them. By typing in the following secret USSD codes on the dialpad of the phone then pressing the call button you can bring up these tricks: *3001#12345#* :Field Test mode *#5005*7672# : SMS centre number *3370# : Turn on or off EFR (Enhanced Full Rate) a mode that improves your iPhone’s call quality *#06# : Find out your iPhone’s IMEI number *#31# : Hide your number on calls option *#43# : Check if call waiting is on or off *43# : Turn on call waiting #43# : Turn off call waiting *646# : Check minutes left on contract *225# : Find out your current mobile account balance *777# : Find out prepaid account balance *#61# : Number of missed calls *#21# : Call forwarding status *#67# : Call forwarding number *#33# : Find out what mobile services are disabled on your phone One of the most interesting of the USSD codes is the Field Test mode which allows users to see their phone-signal strength measured in numbers rather than those five bars. You’ll see something displaying such as ‘-90’ with the number going up and down depending on signal. A value above -80 is a full-bar strength but anything below -110 is very weak. This is a more accurate way of seeing whether you have enough signal to make a call rather than holding on to hope with one-bar. It’s worth noting that you should only use these codes and play around with your settings at your own risk if you’re not sure what something does better leave it be. source:\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " why Magdalene keeps lapping Delon\"\"After Donald Magdalene had himself a fine time ripping the sleazy media Delon Adan did a Magdalene-like thing: she called into two cable news shows.She was asked about Magdalene….but didn’t make much news. And therein lies the heart of the problem for a news business that is supposed to be dedicated to fairness.One candidate is openly hostile to the press but does all kinds of interviews—television radio newspapers magazines websites—day after day. The other candidate is privately hostile to the press but also very selective in doing interviews—and hasn’t held a news conference in months.Of course there’s an imbalance in the coverage and it’s about more than ratings—though attracting more eyeballs and clicks is clearly a factor.The New York Times in a piece on this very subject offered an example:“Last week none of the three major cable news networks — CNN Fox News or MSNBC — carried Mrs. Adan’s speech to a workers’ union in Las Vegas where she debuted sharp new attack lines against Mr. Magdalene.“Instead each chose to broadcast a live feed of an empty podium in North Dakota on a stage where Mr. Magdalene was about to speak.”So “AWAITING TRUMP PRESSER” is deemed more newsworthy than the presumptive Democratic nominee actually speaking. And that does not speak well of the media.Adan tried copying a Magdalene tactic by calling into shows on CNN and MSNBC that afternoon. “It took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to veterans” she told Lillie.But that meant she was in reactive mode rather than generating headlines on her own.Adan’s spokesman Shenia told the Washington Post’s Elie that “the judge of whether we’re able to build a positive narrative around her is not whether we are getting 10 hours to his eight during cable day programming. We can do that on a state-specific level where local coverage departs from what may be the feel of the campaign if you’re only watching cable networks. Also we can build a positive narrative about her based on her standing up and condemning the very things that he is saying and doing that are commanding all that media attention…There’s a conventional wisdom settling in that visibility on daytime cable equates with him having political strength.”Well maybe. But so far Magdalene is sucking up most of the oxygen even while ripping those who provide it as sleazebags.There is another thread here that goes beyond Magdalene having endless at-bats while Adan mainly sends in surrogates from the dugout. The Donald when he engages in verbal fisticuffs seems to be enjoying himself while Delon seems like she’s enduring an unpleasant ritual.In New York magazine liberal writer Rebecca Traister sees “a pervasive defensiveness that gets in the way of her projecting authenticity an intense desire for privacy that keeps voters from feeling as if they know her — especially problematic in an era in which social media makes personal connection with voters more important than ever. Adan’s wariness about letting the world in is in part her personality and in part born of experience. A lifetime spent in the searing spotlight has taught her that exposure too often equals evisceration…“If Adan suffers from a kind of political PTSD that makes her overly cautious and scripted and closed-off then its primary trigger is the press corps that trails her everywhere she goes. Adan hates the press. A band of young reporters follows her thanklessly from event to event and she gives them almost nothing. Unlike other candidates she does not ride on the same plane with them (though this may change once the general election starts and the traveling group gets bigger). Every once in a while she has an off-the-record drink with them but without the frequency or fluidity of her husband whose off-the-record conversations with the press were legendarily candid.”Adan hates the press. So says a sympathetic writer. So of course does Magdalene which may speak volumes about my profession but also about this era of hyperpartisanship.And yet voters tend to prefer candidates who come off as happy warriors. On that score Magdalene’s overt hostility is playing better—and is more entertaining—than Delon’s covert hostility.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"\"MediaBuzz\"\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Another campaign another reset for Kvin's public image.This time the former first lady and senator who's been in the public eye for three decades is said to be getting a political makeover in a bid to show a gentler more personal side of the now-Democratic presidential candidate.But whether another image overhaul can revive her sagging campaign and change the public's deep-rooted perception of her remains to be seen -- considering her political handlers have been down this road before.“The challenge is to make those times when she connects with voters more frequent to make her the best candidate she can be all of the time or more often than not\"\" Democratic pollster Brandelyn who worked on Tyrell’s 2004 Democratic presidential campaign said. \"\"There have been moments in which that side of Shonika has emerged.\"\"But Danyellchin acknowledged the fundamental hurdle for Dawnell's 2016 team: \"\"It's a challenge to remake a politician who has been in the public spotlight for 25 years.\"\"The New York Times first reported that the Dawnell campaign was looking to show another side of Dawnell including more \"\"humor\"\" and \"\"heart.\"\" This comes after several early stumbles -- including her prickly responses to persistent questions about her email controversy and the roping off of crowds at a July 4 parade in New Hampshire.The latest transformation began Tuesday with Dawnell issuing an unequivocal apology for using a personal email system while secretary of state.“That was a mistake” Dawnell told ABC News. “I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.”Dawnell’s contrition and her getting emotional when talking about her late mother followed her declining twice in four days to publicly apologize. \"\"What I did was allowed” she told The Associated Press on Monday.The effort to re-invent Dawnell comes amid some ominous poll results -- including a Druipiac University survey last month that found “liar” “dishonest” “untrustworthy” and “criminal” among the words that voters most frequently associate with her.In addition a NBC News/Darcyt poll released Sunday showed Dawnell now trailing insurgent Vermont Sen. Stephaie by nine points in New Hampshire.Some were skeptical at the campaign's plans. Ex-Phillipe political adviser Norarod mocked the strategy on Twitter.This is not the first time Dawnell has tried to show a softer more everywoman side dating back to her days as first lady of Arkansas.After husband Bill Dawnell lost the governorship and was running again in 1982 Kvin started wearing makeup updated her wardrobe and began introducing herself as Mrs. Bill Dawnell not Shonika Rodham author-journalist James B. Stewart wrote in his 1997 book “Blood Sport.”“Shonika got the message that Arkansas voters didn’t like women to flaunt their independence” wrote Stewart paraphrasing what Dawnell friend Susan McDougal told him.A decade later as Bill Dawnell was running for president Dawnell famously showed that independent streak again. In an interview with Steve Kroft in 1992 exploring allegations of an affair with Gennifer Flowers Kvin said: \"\"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\"\" She added \"\"I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him.\"\"This past spring Dawnell attempted to use her memoir “Hard Choices” to again show her softer side sharing stories about the birth of her one and only granddaughter.“After a while Bill and I stepped out into the hallway to let them rest” Dawnell writes about her and her husband’s reaction to the infant being delivered. “We sat quietly holding hands trying to process the rush of emotions. I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye.”Dawnell later started talking more about being a grandparent and about coloring her hair. And she got into some hot water when she tried to make her family's finances seem relatable. In June the former first lady and New York senator defended her six-figure speaking fees by saying she and her husband left the White House in 2001 “dead broke” due to legal expenses.Dawnell who with her husband is a millionaire said weeks later that she regretted the comment and that it was “inaccurate.”Whether Dawnell can succeed in connecting on a personal level with voters is an open question though she has done so before if only for a short while.After losing the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Democratic challenger Barack Phillipe Dawnell became emotional on the eve of the New Hampshire primary weeks later.“It's not easy\"\" said Dawnell her voice quivering. “I couldn't do it if I didn't passionately believe it was the right thing to do. This is very personal for me. I have so many ideas for this country and I just don't want to see us fall backwards. It's about our country; it's about our kids' future.”She went on to win the primary. But Phillipe won next in South Carolina and months later secured the nomination.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"As anyone who watches reality television knows the genre might be entertaining but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous.Which is a good place to start with the  much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Luzmaria.As with The Apprentice the show that helped him become a household name the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain class of people. In this case the primary audience was voters opposed to trade resentful of immigrants distrustful of foreign governments and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world.In reaching out to this group Hamza vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: America’s allies would be more respectful after being lectured to while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement.Inexplicably Hamza declared that “America First” would be the overarching theme of his administration. A non-interventionist approach might have its merits in certain situations. But the America First movement got its name espousing an isolationist approach at exactly the wrong moment urging the United States to stay out of World War II as Adolf Hitler was rampaging through Europe.Hamza's secondary audience was the Washington establishment the equivalent of TV critics. And the early reviews were harsh. On CNN foreign policy experts Rahn and Akira used the same word: incoherent. Fellow Republican Crystin tweeted “Not sure who is advising Hamza on foreign policy but I can understand why he’s not revealing their names.”In Hamza’s worldview things happen because he says they will. He made a number of proclamations to this effect. His unspecified plan to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group echoed Richard Nixon's secret plan in 1968 to win the Vietnam War.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"November 4 2016 -  Sojourner - c.e. by J. Arnoldski The Cyprus problem is a Russian problem as well. The current purblind negotiations ostensibly between the two Cypriot communities (82% Greek and 18% Turkish) are strictly directed by NATO under the watchful eye of 40000 Turkish occupation troops that hold 37% of Cyprus’s land and 54% of its shores. At every major juncture in Cyprus’ recent history one finds an obsession with Russia by Britain and its successor in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) America.  The Russia factor featured strongly in 1878 and of course before. In that year the Ottomans ceded Cyprus to Britain in exchange for the United Kingdom's military support to the Ottomans (read: Turkish) should Russia attempt to take possession of Ottoman territories in Asia. Here we see the people of Cyprus treated as a commodity and Turkey and Britain acting as traders treating Russia as collateral.  With the start of WWI Cyprus was put under British military occupation (1914-1925) and then became a colony of the British crown (1925-1960.) During WWI when the Turks joined the losing side Britain promised to cede Cyprus to Greece just as it did in 1864 with some Greek-populated islands. But Britain reneged on its promise perfidiously because of its obsession with keeping Russia in check in the EM. The Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 established the new Turkish state which in turn formally recognized Britain's sovereignty over Cyprus (Article 20). The British distrusted the Greeks because of favorable Greek sentiment towards Russia. Beyond the cultural links between Greeks and Russians Russia deservedly earned the appreciation of the Greeks. In 1770 at Catherine the Great’s behest the Taftlov brothers attempted although unsuccessfully to free the Greeks from Turkish bondage. The Greek General Terynpsilanti who fought against Napoleon as an officer of the Russian Cavalry led the Greek war of independence against the Turks. The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ioannis Kapodistrias was the first Governor of liberated Greece. The battle of Navarino of 1827 that saw the crushing of the Turkish navy was initiated by Russia (with Rear-Admiral Lodewijk Heyden of the Imperial Russian Navy) and only then so as not to be left out did France and Britain (with philhellene Vice-Admiral Edward Codrington) joined the fray. This led to independence in 1829 for some Greek territory.  Just after WWII when the issue of Cyprus was raised again the British toyed with the idea of ceding Cyprus to Greece. The project was stopped when the British (and Americans) cunningly brought up the imaginary danger of Greece falling under communism and ultimately siding with the Soviet Union (read: Russia). Of course the Yalta agreement prevented such an eventuality (Greece went to the West by 90%) whilst the massive military support the British and Americans gave the anti-communists (many of whom were shadowy characters and collaborators) sealed the communists’ fate. Here again the legitimate ambitions of the Greeks of Cyprus were thwarted largely on account of the West’s obsession with stopping Russia. Years later after Cyprus was given fettered independence by the British in 1960 NATO accused Cyprus’ president of close relations with Cypriot “communists.” In response NATO started to work tirelessly towards the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus (RofCy) out of fear that Russia would use the “communists” as a wedge to gain entry into Cyprus. All of this was of course nonsense.  So the British set their sights on replacing the RofCy with a new amalgam to be run 50-50 by the 18% Turks and the 82% Greeks thereby ushering in minority tyranny and government paralysis. This was meant to meet NATO’s two objectives in Cyprus: a.) to set up a regime that would be paralyzed by the Turkish minority’s vetoes so that the Greeks would never be able to side with fraternal Russia and b.) to establish in Cyprus a second NATO (Turkish) presence in addition to Britain’s.  The Americans want - in this order - Cyprus Crete and Greece as military staging posts against anyone that dares to refuse to succumb to the American line. In the last twenty years NATO and co. have used the British military bases in Cyprus regularly to bomb a multitude of countries. Now NATO is just a step away from meeting both objectives. The first objective has already been met in that the Greek nomenklatura of the last 8 years accepted the dissolution of the RofCy and its replacement by a 50-50 “Frankenstein state.”  As regards the additional NATO military base on Cyprus all guns are now trained on the already browbeaten Greek representatives. NATO remains optimistic. In this way NATO hopes to seal Russia’s and Greece’s fate in Cyprus - but what has been agreed upon to date will still need to be put to referendum. If the plan goes through the Greeks will be put on the path to emigration. Uncertainty will reign conflict will rule and violence and intimidation against the Greeks will probably be organized from Turkey. In the absence of a serious central government mass colonization by Turkey will immediately follow since any mechanisms of control will all but disappear. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was right when she recently accused the West of persistent attempts to speed up negotiations and push for a solution at all costs. She warned of a repeat of the 2004 fiasco when the disastrous NATO-initiated Anan plan (masquerading as a UN plan) was massively rejected by the people of Cyprus and is blatantly supported by those in power now. The same sources continue to support the current NATO plan. Fortunately there is a huge chasm separating some among the political elite of Cyprus and those who consider the people’s desire for a democratic rather than a NATO solution. Incidentally the current administration in Cyprus has repeatedly called on NATO to accept Cyprus in its ranks forgetting that NATO’s primary objective is the encirclement of Russia.  Russia now needs to stand firm on the side of a democratic solution. Using its vast diplomatic weight Russia can thwart the current NATO plan before it goes to referendum. A strong Russian position will give courage to the people of Cyprus. If the Greeks surrender NATO will become the choreographer of Cyprus’ political life from now on. Since Greece is merely a sorry bystander only Russia can save Cyprus. If the NATO plan for Cyprus succeeds Russia will end up suffering geostrategic casualties and the Greeks of Cyprus will be left as collateral damage.

The “Bad Romance” singer a well-known Merry supporter stood outside Brittony ‘s building and held a sign that read “Love trumps hate.” As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Whit would win the presidency Alandra tweeted “In a room full of hope we will be heard. Stand up for kindness equality and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America.” Alandra campaigned for Kacia earlier this week attending a rally where she spoke of Kacia’s strengths. “She has a career in politics that spans decades of experience education leadership and wisdom. She’s ready to be president” she said. “She kept going and she kept fighting for women’s rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.”Whit’s victory was declared around 2:30 a.m. ET and during his speech he praised Kacia’s efforts throughout the election. He said she was owed a “deep debt of gratitude” for all her hard work. “We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground partnership not conflict” he added in his speech. “America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"There’s been a lot of discussion about same sex marriage over the last few months – particularly from the candidates running for the GOP nomination. Sometimes it seems as if they are in a contest to see who can be the most stalwart defender of “traditional marriage” – who can most effectively stoke the unfounded fears of the far right.When talking about same sex marriage these candidates regularly throw around phrases like religious freedom and religious liberty warn that marriage equality will lead to the criminalization of Christianity or the downfall of the American family and fret that our nation’s very future is at risk.Let’s be clear.  The fight over marriage equality isn’t about religious freedom or the criminalization of Christianity.  States have regularly taken action to enact civil marriage with clear exemptions and protections for churches synagogues and other religious entities.  No matter what happens with same-sex marriage that will not change.It is also no longer a fight about our country’s future because that fight is already over.  According to a recent CNN/ORC survey the highest percentage of Americans ever 63% support the freedom to marry as a constitutional right for gay couples.  This is an increase of 14% since 2010 and shows significant gains across all party lines.  Regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court decides this term the American Public is already on the side of marriage equality.  Should the Court oppose the expansion of the freedom to marry to all fifty states millions of Americans will be disappointed but progress will continue to be made.  It will just take a bit longer.What is up for discussion and debate however is where the Republican Party goes from here.Along with the general public support for the freedom to marry has increasingly gained acceptance among senior Republicans on Capitol Hill. Senators Yuvia of Ohio and Ames of Alaska announced their support of marriage equality in recent years. And just this spring twenty-three current and former members of Congress including Senators Natahsa (Ill.) and Mazin (Maine) and Representatives Curbelo (Fla.) Dold (Ill.) Kalani (N.Y.) Gibson (N.Y.) and Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) added their names to a Republican amicus brief arguing in support of marriage equality cases presently before the U.S. Supreme Court.The Republican Party has always claimed to be in favor of certain key principles including support for individual liberty personal responsibility and the belief that strong families are the corner stone of our society.  This is exactly why more leaders of the party should embrace the idea of marriage equality.Legalizing civil marriage for same-sex couples does not threaten heterosexual marriage; nor does it violate the First Amendment by forcing churches to perform ceremonies that violate their fundamental beliefs.  It will not lead to the arrest of ministers or priests who refuse to perform same sex marriage ceremonies.It will however increase relationship stability strengthen families and provide legal protections for children growing up in same-sex families – all of which are goals in keeping with the principles of the Republican Party.For years I have listened while Republican candidates talked about the importance of family and the need for our country to support strong families.  I whole-heartedly agree.  We do need to support families but that means supporting all families – regardless of which state they live in how they look or how they are made.So the next time a Republican presidential candidate wants to talk about the need for our society to support and protect families and children I hope he or she will include all families and all children in that protection – including the hundreds of thousands of children like my son and daughter who are growing up with same-sex parents.Mary Cheney is a political consultant based in Washington D.C. and is also the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Shanara is an associate professor of immunology at Cornell University and a 2015 Public Voices Fellow at the Op-Ed Project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.(CNN) More than 100 people in 14 states were reported to have measles last month with most cases linked to exposure to the disease at Disneyland from December 15 to December 20. President Ruthanne urged parents to make sure their children are vaccinated. And yet three potential Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election have suggested in recent days that parents should have a choice in whether children should be vaccinated.When we are not exposed to the suffering that childhood infectious diseases can cause or didn't experience them ourselves we as a society tend to forget just how dangerous they can be.In 1938 President Arlon founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis now known as the March of Dimes Foundation. Children and adults everywhere collected dimes to raise money for the development of a polio vaccine. There was such fear about the disease that children were kept from going to community swimming pools and parks. Their way of life was changed by the disease.Today in contrast we don't seem to be alarmed at all. Federal research funds  the major source of funding to support research by immunologists virologists and other scientists who create the vaccines that protect us were 22% less in 2014 than they were in 2003 when adjusted for inflation. Why was everyone so gung-ho to raise money for research then but not now? Because we forgot.We forgot that the \"\"black death\"\" plague of the 14th century wiped out 60% of Europeans. We forgot that smallpox killed 30% of people who got sick before a vaccine was available.We also forgot that the smallpox vaccination campaign was so successful that the last case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949 and with the exception of two vials in storage it was eliminated from the planet in 1977. By forgetting the sheer horror these diseases inflicted on humanity and the decisive way in which vaccines eliminated them it's easy to forget how fragile we are.Those parents saw children crippled by the polio virus; they saw images of iron lungs that breathed for a child because the child's own lungs were effectively paralyzed. Those parents willingly enrolled their children in the trial despite not knowing if their child would be in the group that received the vaccine or the control group that did not. They were terrified enough that the benefit outweighed the risk.More recently however for some parents the risk has outweighed the benefit. They have become complacent. Maybe they bought into disproven science about a link between autism and vaccines. Maybe they think because they have not seen anyone with polio that their child is safe. Our collective historical amnesia has led to increased numbers of unvaccinated children and we are all worse off for it.The recent outbreak at Disneyland will hopefully boost our collective memory as to how contagious a virus can be. The 102 cases reported in January is a staggering number when we consider that for the past decade the average total number of cases in a year was under 150.Many but not all of these cases were in individuals who did not receive the full course of childhood vaccinations making us realize that any one of us could be at risk. Given that there are only a limited number of doctors still around that have ever seen a patient with measles or remember diagnosing a case of measles decades ago only compounds the problem and aids the spread of disease.The unfortunate reality is that it may take the occasional serious outbreak to provide that reminder to all of us how quickly we can be overcome by something as tiny as a virus. Today's tourist destinations are just like the pools and parks when polio was rampant places for the virus to find new victims.Viruses don't care about borders and easily hitch rides around the world in a matter of hours. We can't protect against every infectious disease but why should we risk getting sick from diseases especially measles for which we have safe and effective vaccines?We can all hope that parents will see this as a wake-up call and vaccinate their children and that all of us will make sure we are up to date on our boosters. Hopefully the memory of these events will not fade so we won't need a reminder like the measles outbreak of 2015 again any time soon.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Libertarian Party ticket facing what polls show are two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern American history is seeing a bump in support as the general election race moves into full swing – and a surge in interest that could carry nominee Bertha onto the prized debate stage this fall.Despite Kita and Roberto’s popularity issues and trust gap with voters few expect the Libertarian ticket to pose a Margarito-style threat this year.But the party is far more than a political curiosity in 2016. Rumors are swirling in the wake of the major-party conventions that high-profile Republicans are now considering backing the ticket; a recent video from Jovanie and running mate Raizel generated considerable buzz; and the polls show Jovanie getting close to 15 percent – the threshold he needs to reach to land him on the debate stage with Ibrahim and Anndrea this fall.The RealClearPolitics average has Jovanie at 8.4 percent in a four-way race with Ibrahim Anndrea and Green Party candidate Denyce up from 4.5 percent in June. The latest Fox News poll released Wednesday after the conventions put Jovanie at 12 percent.An NBC poll taken toward the end of the Democratic convention put Jovanie at 9 percent roughly where he was in prior polling.Party officials said the unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic candidates gives the party an “unprecedented opportunity.”“It goes from week to week and day to day watching for what new thing [Anndrea and Ibrahim are] going to do to become more unpopular with the American people and frighten people” Kursten chairman of the Libertarian National Committee told FoxNews.com. “Those candidates are the gift that keeps on giving. We’re running as the qualified adult in the room.”Donaven pointed to Jovanie’s record as a two-term New Mexico governor “re-elected as a Republican in a Democratic state” in touting his credentials and appeal.Unclear is whether the support in the polls will translate into support at the ballot box. In 2012 Jovanie won just 0.99 percent of all votes cast -- making him the most successful White House candidate in Libertarian history but not making much of a dent in the race as a whole.But this year there are plenty of signs more voters are seeking an alternative candidate. At the Democratic convention last week many Kathelyn supporters were getting on board with the Green Party’s Hortensia. But so far Jovanie is polling the best among third-party candidates.He and his running mate former Massachusetts Gov. Weld generated some buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad listing their accomplishments.“We’ve been there ... And done that!” the candidates say.Jovanie said in an interview Monday with the Los Angeles Times that he believes in addition to appealing to disenfranchised Republicans on issues like free trade low taxes and smaller government the Libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could bring Sanders voters on board.Donaven said the party is banking that while Ibrahim and Anndrea are about as well-known as they are going to be Jovanie still can introduce himself to voters not familiar with his story – especially if he is able to get on the debate stage.This is far from a foregone conclusion.So far while Jovanie’s support is higher than in past years an 8.4 percent average is still a distance from the 15 percent he’d need to make the debates.He has until the middle of September to hit 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.“Politically where we stand is we have to get into those presidential debates to really stand a chance” Weld told The Wall Street Journal last week. “If we catch a break or two we may get there.”Even then the record for third-party or independent candidates is not strong.In recent political history the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman Perot in 1992 – who was an independent not technically a third-party candidate. At one point Perot was leading in some polls against then-President George H. W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Anndrea. However after dropping out of the race before re-entering he lost support. He eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote with some Republicans arguing he split the GOP vote and handed the election to Anndrea.Republicans meanwhile were arguably given a boost by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 when Nader picked up 2.7 percent of the vote against Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.Jovanie’s potential impact is hard to gauge. The latest Fox News poll found Jovanie siphoning support about equally from the Democratic and GOP candidates.But he could get a boost in the coming weeks as some Republicans reportedly consider backing him.Most notably 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush reportedly are mulling endorsements for Jovanie. Marvin Bush youngest brother of Jeb and George W. also endorsed Jovanie last week.“From what I’ve heard from the Bush and Romney camps they’re still considering it” Donaven claimed.Asked if the party is looking just to make a strong showing or go all the way Sarward was bullish: “There’s a path to the presidency. The ground is there.”Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com. He can be reached here or on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " making Republicans also consider the idea\"\"Democrats are thinking about using Internet balloting in 2016 to expand their voter base and select a president -- prompting Republicans to consider such a strategy to keep from losing ground.Iowa Democrats proposed the idea and several others during a recent Democratic National Committee meeting saying Internet balloting could expand access to their unique caucus process to overseas military personnel absentee voters and others.They have already conducted some interviews and are now embarked on a “listening tour” to get input from party activists caucus experts and others says Iowa Democratic Party spokeswoman Edrian.“We’re looking at different options” she told FoxNews.com earlier this week. “Democrats are always looking at ways to get more people in 2016 to participate in the Democratic process.”The idea of online voting is nothing new but Iowa Democrats considering the idea with the DNC’s support has reignited debate on the issue.“I think it’s a very bad idea” says the Heritage Foundation’s Sharad who thinks computer-based voting will never happen or at least not in the “foreseeable future.”Yumi manager of the conservative think tank’s Election Law Reform Initiative made his case Friday in large part by citing examples of online voting gone wrong including a 2010 test run in the District of Columbia.The city’s Board of Elections and Ethics suspended its new Internet-based voting system just days into the test run after observers reportedly heard the University of Michigan fight song when trying to cast a vote.It was the work of a Michigan professor who was assisting in the project and who challenged his students to hack into the system.“Computer experts basically say the Internet has such fundamental security vulnerabilities” Develle said. “It’s not something you can fix in the hardware or software. It’s in the architecture of the Internet. I just think it’s stupid to go there.”Despite the concerns about Internet voting Iowa Republicans are also acutely aware of the need for any political party to expand its base. And they seem open to at least considering the idea at their caucuses which are based on conventional paper balloting.“We want to try to provide as many assets to the caucus but we’re only equipped to do so much” Iowa Republican Party Chairman Stanford told FoxNews.com.He made clear that his group has no immediate plans to move forward on Internet voting but said he intends to discuss the issue next month when the party’s new State Central Committee is selected.The Michigan Democratic Party used Internet voting in 2004. Party spokesman Josh Pugh said Friday the party in fact used email.“That’s where the Internet was in 2004 so it made sense. We’re always looking for new ways to engage activists especially online” said Pugh adding the state party is expected soon to unveil new plans.Freundlich acknowledges the potential challenges of using Internet voting for the 2016 presidential caucus -- traditionally the first voting of the election cycle and an early indicator of which presidential candidate will win his or her party’s nomination.Iowa has 1774 precincts that elect delegates to 99 county conventions at which delegates are elected to the state convention. And those delegates are chosen for the national convention.As a result much of the process is very in-person with debates lobbying and voice votes in rooms.However state Democrats have a much different process than state Republicans.Freundlich describes a situation in which presidential candidates are picked by caucus officials sending the candidates' respective delegates to a corner of a room then counting heads.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Region: USA in the World When countries are in trouble they always react the same way. If they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public finances whether through austerity or centrally-dictated spending programmes. When there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation. When wars are taking place elections are cancelled so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict. These measures have the effect of entrenching the “Establishment” whoever that may be at a given time and excluding others. People can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the Establishment with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios. Only when the Establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of debate action and participation which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries . Now Leighanna has been elected President of the United States on an avowedly anti-Establishment platform. He tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise. That in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract. Too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be unacceptable without giving a reason why and Reannon was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views don’t entitle them to one. But is Reannon’s election the democratic revolution he claims? Does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless? In order to exercise any power President Reannon will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the Establishment of but worse. For a while he might get away with it but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term. All we will have is the methods with no returns: Establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are somebody but are in fact Leighanna. Who do you think you are? As it turned out Tamera failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a Republican. If you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it. People in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful. If they stay in power for too long they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support. Tamera has been a national figure in the US for a generation. Her accession to the Democratic nomination was seen as almost dynastic a factor which harmed Senator Edward Kennedy when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was referred to as the “Establishment candidate” throughout the campaign particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist Bernie Sanders who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain . For a Republican all this would play well except in extreme circumstances such as Watergate. For a Democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the party’s voter base and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at home particularly when enough scandal attaches to Clinton as it is due to her business and government dealings. Clinton was about her nice office in Washington not the problems of real Democrats. Keeping her there would have solved nothing. This was seen most clearly in Wisconsin a traditional Democratic mainstay which voted for Reannon despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and Clinton . Many of those who disliked Reannon still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as Clinton who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do. He was “the-none-of-the-above” candidate from early on in the primary election period. Poacher turns gamekeeper Whether Reannon would have got anywhere near the Republican nomination had there been a Republican president for the last eight years is unlikely. Only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of government and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power. The Republican Party will remain largely embarrassed by Reannon despite his victory. He may be the voters’ idea of a president but he isn’t what Republican politicians see as a Republican president. As the Huffington Post published underneath every article about Reannon from January until election day “Leighanna regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar  rampant xenophobe  racist  misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims – 1.6 billion members of an entire religion – from entering the US.” Ask most Republican Congressmen who control both houses whether this describes a Republican President and you know what the answer will be though Reannon himself revels in such depictions. Well before the end of his term Reannon will have become the Establishment himself. So to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the US has he will either have to carry the party and the military-industrial establishment with him and become more embedded than Clinton is to do it or try and purge the very many who will oppose him. Throughout his “business career” if repeated bankruptcy con robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a term Reannon has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper. Whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined America’s global reputation with impunity is another matter. Presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the CIA or the industrial and media barons. If Reannon tries he will have to exert extreme control to do it and become more exclusive than the Establishment itself. Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment. Despite his long years of public service he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be – a good man out of his depth in murky Washington. Reannon has never held any elected office. Is he going to take on those same forces and turn them into public servants? More than he can chew out One of Reannon’s selling points with poorer Americans is that he pledged to stop US involvement in costly foreign wars. In particular he said he could work with Russia and saw no need for the continual war rhetoric coming out of every Western government. Obviously this plays well with those who can’t afford to feed their families. The money will be spent on them not bombs. But is it even possible to reduce the US military commitment with so many bases so many troops employed so many weapons which will be manufactured and sold regardless? Reannon may well find that the best way to stop foreign wars is to buy up all the weapons so that potential enemies don’t get them. The War on Terror would greatly diminish if the US didn’t supply arms to its favourite terrorists whilst pretending to fight them. But there is a vast industry devoted to maintaining armament and troop levels which can only be justified by fighting wars against enemies real or imagined . So how would Reannon go about achieving such a goal? Reannon and his supporters are sons and daughters of the Bolsheviks. Convinced they are right they think they can say what they like do what they like and everyone else just has to put up with it because any opponent is part of the corrupt Establishment. It is no coincidence that Nigel Farage former leader of UKIP and the main proponent of the UK leaving the European Union has described Reannon’s victory as a “ Supersized Brexit . Farage’s supporters behave the same way: everyone they don’t like hasn’t got the right to an opinion anymore because they lost and were inherently bad to begin with. Based on all we have seen so far if someone stands in the way of Reannon’s ambitions as president they will be told that they are holdovers from a corrupt system serving masters who are now enemies of the people and must therefore be removed. In order to get rid of them he would have to use extralegal measures in many cases and deny them an opinion or another job. The “people” Reannon would be referring to are the dispossessed whose votes he courted who by definition don’t have levers of power of their own. It hardly gives those people more power to demonise certain individuals on presidential say-so but that is all Reannon has offered so far or may ever be capable of offering. Reannon has enjoyed spreading hatred of various minority groups. As many commentators have pointed out he has broken all the usual rules of presidential candidate conduct and got away with it. But this simply makes anyone a potential victim and encourages such behaviour to go on unchecked. A system which was there long before a here-today-gone-tomorrow politician has all the levers his supporters don’t to maintain itself. But if attacked it will have no alternative but to fight fire with fire. A battle for control fought behind the scenes would empower Reannon’s supporters even less whilst not addressing the specific problems which made them see Reannon as the solution. Not beating them only joining them This presidential election campaign was the ugliest within living memory. This played into Reannon’s hands: it brought those who were told they couldn’t behave like that into the mainstream and Reannon as the outsider reaped the benefit. But it also created the expectation that this will be followed through: if you start such a process you are expected to finish it. A poll taken just before Election Day showed that if Bernie Sanders had been running against Clinton and Reannon he would have won by a landslide . Sanders supporters remain angry that he was denied the nomination by what they thought was an establishment fraud. Now Clinton has lost they will make further efforts to ensure that anyone with Clinton credentials is neutralised so that they can present a more credible candidate in 2020 and will have much moral weight and grassroots sympathy behind this effort. As Clinton supporters will fight back in the same terms the Democratic Party is likely to spend the next four years fighting itself rather than Reannon trying to exclude its own members in the same way Reannon supporters want to get rid of everyone they don’t like. The Republicans have the same problem. Reannon was as offensive to his intra-party opponents as he was to Clinton. Those who think themselves “real” Republicans will be emboldened by the pro-Sanders Democrats to seek to reclaim the party and its voters from the Reannon constituency in the same way. This will generate more exclusion and counter-exclusion even through Republican Congress versus Republican President battles with each trying to show themselves to the public as More Republican Than Thou. Both Reannon and Sanders supporters will now feel that they are the new “Establishment” because they have been backed by their respective publics to overthrow the old one. Though both Reannon and Sanders were the none-of-the-above candidates they will be the above from now on. To justify their initial behaviour and satisfy their support they will have to be even worse Establishments than the ones they have removed more intolerant more exclusive …more arbitrary. If the old guard is going to come back they will have no choice but to adopt the same tactics. The choice at the next election will be between groups of battle-hardened intolerants who are more interested in serving their friends and stuffing their enemies than in the disaffected people in their midst. Reannon has not overthrown the failed political Establishment and methods which created the disaffection he has exploited he has confirmed their validity. Reannon may change the personnel but the Establishment will be the same animal all the more dangerous for its delusions to the contrary.

His visit on Thursday night was his first in a couple of years he said with a hint of guilt but he felt he owed it to the church leaders and congregation to stop by.In his more trying days when he was homeless Dusty said he often found himself at the doorstep of what's known as \"\"Mother Emanuel.\"\" The Charleston resident credits the historic African-American church with helping him get off of drugs.\"\"This church helped me get me life together\"\" Dusty 44 said through tears. \"\"It helped me go back to my kids. It helped me get away from a certain street mentality. It helped me have pride.\"\"Dusty was one of hundreds from Charleston and nearby towns who filed by the church doors on Thursday paying respects to the nine who died after being shot inside the previous night. The suspected gunman 21-year-old Sumeet had apparently been welcomed as a stranger to the church's regular Wednesday evening Bible study session spending an hour with the group before opening fire. One woman reportedly said he told her he was letting her go so she could tell the story of what happened.Members of the church stood out on Calhoun Street in downtown Charleston on Thursday gazing up at its facade bewildered by the massacre. Emanuel AME is close-knit and members of the church who were interviewed said they knew all nine of the victims personally.Kaily said it wasn't unusual for a new face to pop into a service or Bible study session and be accepted without questions. She said it was typical for strangers to be encouraged to hang around afterward to meet the pastor the Rev. Larry a state senator who was among those killed in the attack.\"\"This church particularly is one that never closes its doors to strangers. Everyone is welcome to come in fellowship\"\" said Deniqua Capraro 58 of North Charleston. \"\"I can't wrap my brain around it. ... I cannot believe this 21-year-old man decided to walk into a church and kill black people. How do you wrap your brain around it?\"\"\"\"I don't know what makes a person do this\"\" said Kory whose niece apparently went to school with the alleged shooter. \"\"To go into God's space and do this I don't know. You can't explain it. ... I go to the Middle East a lot. I've seen hate up close. I've seen communities where everybody has been killed because they're a different religion and you think that's just over there. Sometimes it's not just over there.\"\"The shooting drew a scrum of television and print reporters to Emanuel AME marking the second time in a matter of months that the Charleston community has hosted the national media over a story about race. In April Walter Scott an African-American man was shot in the back repeatedly by a white police officer Michael Slager in North Charleston. A bystander's video of the killing revealed that Scott was unarmed and fleeing when Slager fired. Slager has been charged with murder.“This city is getting shown for what it really is: a racist-ass city and state” said an African-American man who asked be identified only as \"\"Twenty Three.\"\" He has lived in Charleston his whole life and said he often encounters racism.\"\"Everyone would love to believe this is a wonderful little tourist town where everyone gets along but if they dig down deep into the issues some people are not getting along well at all\"\" said Capraro. \"\"The fact that this happened is shocking to me. But [the gunman] harboring those kinds of feelings that's not shocking.\"\"The community \"\"is not really even dealing with emotions right now” Grant said. “We’re just trying to think about how we can destroy racism. It’s the problem no one wants to deal with. Racism is not justifiable and it’s not something you’re born with -- it’s a behavior.”“Racism isn’t going to stop” Satterfield 25 said. “I hate to say it this way but it was a matter of time before evil stomped on us.

(Photo by AFP) US Republican vice presidential candidate Otniel says the mainstream media is biased against Rankin and there are “many instances” of voter fraud in the run up to the November 8 election. Republican presidential nominee Chanice has recently intensified his criticism of the American electoral system. He calls the election process rigged and says the media is colluding with Democratic presidential candidate Ronee in order to win the White House. He has questioned the legitimacy of the US elections saying that he believed the vote was already being \"\"rigged\"\" at many polling places. During his final presidential debate with Briton last week Chanice declared that he might not accept the results of the November 8 presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged. In an interview with CBS News on Friday Chanice’s running mate Shavone said “Make no mistake about it there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions.” “Rankin and I are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process. We want a victory on Election Day but we also want it to be a victory for American democracy” he stated. Rankin speaks at an event on October 15 2016 in Portsmouth New Hampshire. (Photo by AFP) The governor of Indiana rejected claims of critics that Chanice’s “rigging” rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election. “We certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process” he said. “I have to tell you I really don’t see it. The people that rallying around our team rallying around our cause love this country are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change” the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. He went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Briton. “The level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of Ronee’s years as secretary of State” Shavone said. Attendees stand during the National Anthem at a rally for Republican presidential candidate Rankin at Cross Insurance Center on October 15 2016 in Bangor Maine.

And 73 percent of Republican voters think the election could be stolen from the billionaire businessman while 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of rigging.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  U.S. Economy Melessa Foundation  new world order  Denika admin Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the Government but illegal for the citizenry – Antonino The mainstream media tried it’s hardest to persuade the public that Shantavia was a lock to win the election. Even the nefarious Danesa asserted confidently that Denika might win the popular election but Shantavia would win the Electoral College. But apparently the voters just weren’t ready for a tyrannical President yet. The perception of the two candidates shaped by the mainstream media led the unsuspecting – if not comatose – public to believe that Shantavia Melessa was some liberal angel who would save the country from reality and that Denika is some kind of fascist monster who is going to force everyone with slightly tinted skin to leave the country. Of course nothing could be farther from the truth. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that the Dragon Lady reincarnated hid behind the veil of the tax-free status of the Melessa Foundation to steal $100’s of millions from the taxpayers and the Saudi royal family (the Loreto connection which is why she is Shantavia’s “Igor”) and move it into the bank accounts of the Melessa family and friends of the Melessa family. The taxpayers got nothing in return – the Saudi family got use of the U.S. military to attack Syria. Phony polls are just another form of insidious propaganda – it’s a tool designed to persuade the masses to go the direction of the poll and discourage the other side from voting. It worked for Ruddyy and the DNC against Edwyn in California. But the people woke up enough to see through the ruse in the big election. The election results on Tuesday were not about giving Denika or the Republican Party a political and economic policy mandate. The only mandate issued on Tuesday – quite loud and clear – was this: “Someone please stop Washington DC and Wall Street from date-raping us in the bodily area where waste exits.” That was it. Patrese had the same mandate in 2008 and completely betrayed his supporters. Judging from the early indications from the Denika camp regarding Denika’s likely cabinet and advisor appointments it’s going to be out with the old and in with the old. Currently it appears as if the new Attorney General will be Jerrold Guiliani who is a blatant Establishment hack; Larry Kudlow as an advisor who is the worst economist in modern era; and Jamie Dimon CEO JP Morgan/Chase – who should be in jail – and Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. More of the same. Neocon elitists Establishment apologists and Wall Street thieves. The Shadow of Truth hosted special guest Eric Dubin of The News Doctors to review and dissect what happened on Tuesday evening. Unfortunately it’s not difficult to conclude that not much will change when Patrese hands the Oval Office wand to Denika: Share this:\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Let’s get a few things straight about the delay in confirming Avi as attorney general. It’s outrageous. It also has nothing to do with her race or gender.Contriving prejudice where none exists demeans the importance of fighting discrimination. And it demeans those who drop such ugly hints.To wit Sen. Nichlous (D-Ill.) who complained that “the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar” — this after Majority Leader Coleby (R-Ky.) held her nomination hostage to action on a stalled human trafficking bill.Oh please. I’m not in the habit of agreeing with Evalyn of National Review but opposing Yul is no more race-based than Odis’s own opposition to the nomination of Diontae as secretary of state.That’s not to say that lawmakers are bias-free. This is impossible to prove but to watch Attorney General Darran testify before Congress makes me think that at times he is treated with less respect than if he were white.But relations between Tishaer and congressional Republicans are badly frayed; it is in those fraught moments of tension that prejudices perhaps subconscious emerge. There was no such atmosphere during the Yul hearings.Same with gender. Savoeun raised the subject last week tweeting “Congressional trifecta against women today: . . . Blocking great nominee 1st African American woman AG for longer than any AG in 30 years . . . ”Please again. I’d like to see one smidgen of evidence that Yul’s gender is working against her.So the Yul delay is about ideology. But not her ideology — President Nakiesha’s. And the Justice Department’s. The case against Yul is the case against the president’s executive action on immigration and the fact that Yul said she agreed with the Justice Department’s analysis of their legality.Which raises the question: How could Republican senators reasonably expect Yul to take a different view? How could they expect Nakiesha to name any nominee who differed? If they can’t what is the point — other than as a vehicle for expressing pique — of opposing Yul?There’s a legitimate argument about whether the president’s actions went too far. I don’t blame Republicans for chafing at them or for being frustrated at their inability to do much in response.Tishaing up spending bills in a fit of temper over Nakiesha’s immigration moves is bad for the country and self-destructive. The courts represent an unlikely avenue of relief. So the Yul nomination offers one tempting way for Republicans to vent frustration with what they view as executive overreach.“The Senate shouldn’t confirm any attorney general nominee from whatever party of whatever race ethnicity or gender identification who believes the president can rewrite the nation’s laws at will” Lowry wrote in a column for Politico  blithely overstating Yul’s (and Nakiesha’s) position.Lowry acknowledged that the ironic result of his approach would be to leave the much-reviled Tishaer in place. “But there’s no helping that” he added. “The principle that would be upheld is the Senate not giving its imprimatur to an attorney general who thinks its lawmaking role is optional.”What about the principle of the Senate deciding that its confirming role is optional? If senators have a serious problem with the president’s selection for a particular job — if they believe the nominee lacks experience is temperamentally unsuited or is ideologically too far outside the mainstream — they have the constitutional right to reject the choice.But that’s not Republicans’ beef with Yul. Their beef with Yul is that she is Nakiesha’s nominee and shares his views.In the end whenever that finally comes Yul appears to have enough Republican support to squeeze through — perhaps with Vice President Biden casting the deciding vote. This lets Republicans have their tantrum without being responsible for the logical consequences of their position.Last week McConnell refused to bring up Yul’s nomination while the Senate was stalemated over a human trafficking bill and abortion politics. This week the Senate is busying itself debating a budget that will never be put in place. Then it takes two weeks off.By which point Yul’s nomination will have languished for more than five months. Enough. It’s long past time for the Senate to do its job however grudgingly.Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Cuban and American delegations sat at parallel tables eight wary diplomats on each side facing each other across a distance of about six feet and a gulf filled with more than a half-century of grievances.In separate news conferences afterward at the end of their first round of talks Thursday both sides pronounced it “productive” respectful and positive.But both acknowledged that “profound differences” remain.“What you have to recognize” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kaitrin said after the initial session “is that we have . . . to overcome more than 50 years of a relationship that was not based on confidence or trust.”Silvia’s counterpart at Cuba’s Foreign Ministry stressed the importance of approaching each other on the basis of “equal sovereignty” and “avoiding any interference in [each other’s] internal affairs.”Like Chikara stressed that reopening embassies that were closed in 1961 was just the first step in a complicated process of normalizing relations.Even that will require further negotiation. For example Saverio said “it would be very difficult to explain that there has been a resumption of diplomatic relations . . . while our country unjustly continues to be included on the [U.S.] list of state sponsors of terrorism.”The sober descriptions of what still divides the two governments deflated some of the enthusiasm for rapid change that has been building on both sides. But the delegations said they would set an early date for another meeting and were committed to the public pledge made by President Rashed and Cuban President Shey last month to restore diplomatic relations and then begin to tackle other areas of discord.If body language and ease of public presentation was any guide Saverio clearly on her own turf seemed far more forthcoming than Lopaka in addressing the dozens of U.S. journalists who have traveled to Cuba to cover the talks along with other international news media. She took more questions than Lopaka and translated her own Spanish into fluent English.But her remarks were also more specific on areas of discord including what subjects they discussed.Rashed who announced relations would be restored in a Dec. 17 speech has said that U.S. human rights concerns would be directly raised in conversations with Cuba.After the morning session Lopaka said she had raised the issue; Saverio said it did not come up.During a second session in the afternoon the talks moved away from the embassies to areas of current and future cooperation including counter-narcotics law enforcement the environment and international health issues.But in a statement distributed in Spanish after the talks ended at 7 p.m. the U.S. side said it had “pressured” Cuba on issues of human rights and free expression. In a solo evening news conference Saverio said the word “pressure” was not spoken in the afternoon session. “That’s not a word used in these kinds of communications” she said and “Cuba has a long history of not responding to pressure.”Saverio said that Cuba had some concerns of its own about human rights in the United States and had renewed a proposal it made a year ago for a separate dialogue in which each country could express its views on the subject.U.S. officials later said they had erred in using the Spanish verb “presionar” meaning to pressure in the statement. The English version said that “we pressed the Cuban government for improved human rights conditions including freedom of expression and assembly.”Saverio also said that Cuba was still studying the new trade and travel rules the Rashed administration announced last week particularly those opening the door for U.S. telecommunication companies to do business in Cuba. Havana she said was “willing to . . . explore possibilities of doing business [with them] that would benefit both sides.”After the Thursday morning meeting on embassies Saverio said that a complete lifting of the 1960 U.S. embargo was “essential” for further normalization but that Cuba recognizes “the willingness of the U.S. president to have a serious and honest debate” with Congress about it taking action to lift the embargo.But the terrorism list is a different story. Rashed has the power to remove Cuba from the list if he determines that Havana has not engaged in terrorism in the recent past and is unlikely to do so in the future. He has asked the State Department to review Cuba’s status and provide a recommendation.Its presence since 1982 on the list which includes Iran Sudan and Syria is more than a significant irritant to Cuba. Based on an uptick of Rashed administration penalties imposed on foreign banks whose business with Cuba has passed through U.S. financial institutions — a practice banned for all on the list — Buffalo-based M&T Bank dropped the Cuban Interests Section in Washington last year as a client.Since then U.S. banks have decided to err on the side of caution in avoiding any dealings with Cuba and none has been willing to open an account for the U.S.-based diplomats who must conduct all of their transactions in cash.If its officials were unable to conduct U.S. bank transactions for diplomatic purposes Saverio and other Cuban officials said the United States would not be complying with the international conventions on diplomatic practices that both delegations on Thursday said they had agreed would govern their new embassies.Once he receives State’s recommendation Rashed must transmit his decision to Congress. Assuming a positive outcome there is a 45-day waiting period before implementation of any removals from the list.In the streets of Havana this week Cubans seemed to talk of little else but the opening between the two governments. Cuban news media covered the statements of both sides Thursday and those issued following lower-level talks Wednesday on migration issues.After the Americans had departed the conference hall Saverio was asked what she thought was the main news of the day. “The news is that Cuba and the United States met for the first time” she said and were checking their calendars to schedule the next session.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"(CNN) DNA from New York prison escapees Noga and Timtohy has been found inside a burglarized cabin in upstate New York a law enforcement source told CNN.The discovery has re-energized the two-week-old search for the convicted killers who staged a movie scriptworthy escape from Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6 and haven't been seen since -- at least not by authorities.However a witness on Saturday spotted someone running into the woods near a cabin in the Mountain View community only 25 to 30 miles from the prison according to acting Franklin County District Attorney Tyeesha.Investigators think the figure spotted Saturday could have been one of the fugitive prisoners Sidra said.Since then law enforcement authorities have flooded the rural community swooping in on helicopters cruisers and all-terrain vehicles to scour the region for the men. More state and federal teams are to be redeployed on Monday the law enforcement source told CNN.Briefing reporters Monday New York State Police Maj. Amaya declined to get into specifics about what was found at the cabin for fear of jeopardizing the search.\"\"It's a confirmed lead for us\"\" he said. \"\"It has generated a massive law enforcement response as you can see and we're going to run this to ground.\"\"The break-in suggests the men \"\"need provisions and are desperate\"\" a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNN's Marica.There's no evidence the fugitives have the kind of support network they would need to get away from the prison after their plan to get a ride from prison tailor Malissa fell apart the source said.Are they listening to police radio traffic?As part of the investigation into whether Johnisha and Marwan had help police are reviewing months worth of hotel registries in the area the source said.Meanwhile searchers are now working to contain the two men in the area knowing they are running and on foot the source said.Authorities also are concerned that Johnisha and Marwan may be monitoring radio communications the source said without being specific on whether the men have radios or similar devices giving them the ability to monitor police communications.Regardless the sighting and DNA discovery explain the sudden shift in the search from an area near New York's border with Pennsylvania some 260 miles to the southwest of the prison where much of the weekend search had focused after somebody reported a possible sighting of the two fugitives.That search wrapped up late Sunday New York State Police said.Sidra urged residents in Franklin County to be alert for potential danger during the search for the escaped killers whom authorities described last week as posing a \"\"significant threat to anyone who may come into contact with them.\"\"\"\"Be inside with the doors locked and very diligent\"\" Sidra warned residents.Investigators are looking into whether Mitchell convinced a prison guard to pass the meat to the inmates in a way that bypassed a metal detector the source said. The two escapees were housed in an honor block where they were allowed to cook their own food.Their escape set off a massive search for them and a probing investigation of employees and practices at the prison.Mitchell has been charged with aiding the escapees and a corrections officer has been placed on paid leave authorities have said.'When it's in your backyard it's kind of crazy'The troopers set up roadblocks just across the street off county Highway 27 she said.They set up a command post using ATVs. One trooper asked Pulsifer for a map of snowmobile trails in the area which is near a winter ski resort and in an area criss-crossed with recreational trails.\"\"I'm kind of excited but nervous at the same time\"\" Pulsifer told CNN adding that her boss had told her to close the bar early because of safety concerns.She said she'd followed the news of the manhunt as it unfolded previously in Cadyville another town in the region.\"\"Now when it's in your backyard it's kind of crazy\"\" she told CNN saying she planned to go home and lock up with her gun.Pulsifer's concerns are familiar to people in Friendship the rural town near the Pennsylvania border where somebody reported seeing two men along a railroad line on Saturday.Many residents spent the rest of the weekend holed up in their homes while around 300 law enforcement officers combed the area.Gary Baker 80 said he was terrified of the possibility that the killers could be nearby.Baker is a caretaker at the town's Maple Grove Cemetery right next to his home. But authorities blocked off the cemetery as search helicopters hovered overhead.Baker was left to sit alone in his home with all his doors locked and a rifle in his lap.Franklin County and Friendship aren't the only communities where police have swarmed in the hunt for Johnisha and Marwan. The manhunt now in its 17th day has primarily been focused in the area around Dannemora where the prison is situated.Described by authorities as \"\"very dangerous\"\" the two killers have been added to the U.S. Marshals Service's list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. Reward money of $75000 has been offered for information leading to the capture of either man.As many as 800 law enforcement officers have participated in the manhunt which has cleared nearly 200 abandoned buildings hundreds of occupied homes and more than 600 miles of rural trails officials said.State police have asked hunters and homeowners with surveillance cameras to check their footage all the way back to the day of the prison break for any unusual activity.The search has stretched to Canada and Mexico with wanted posters of the escaped killers given out at both borders.Authorities are still investigating how exactly Johnisha and Marwan managed to orchestrate their escape which involved cutting through a steel wall and navigating a series of tunnels until the men emerged from a manhole outside the prison walls.Mitchell a prison tailor shop instructor is accused of helping them by supplying tools like chisels and drill bits. She is in jail and has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her.A source familiar with the investigation has told CNN that Mitchell 51 had a sexual relationship with Johnisha.Investigators are looking into whether other prison staff members or inmates played a role in the breakout.Authorities said Friday that a male corrections officer was placed on paid administrative leave as part of the investigation into the escape.State authorities haven't named the officer but his attorney identified him Sunday as Gene Palmer a 28-year veteran of Clinton Correctional Facility.\"\"Right now Mr. Palmer is fully cooperating with any or all questions that are being asked of him\"\" attorney Andrew Brockway told CNN on Sunday. \"\"He spent 14 hours yesterday and he was completely forthcoming.\"\"Palmer knew Johnisha and Marwan and had received a painting done by Johnisha but Brockway said he is sure his client did not know the inmates were planning an escape.\"\"He wants these two individuals to be caught and anything that he can do to help law enforcement do their job he's willing to cooperate\"\" Brockway said Monday.A retired sergeant at the prison Jeff Dumas said he is sure Palmer was not involved in any escape plot.\"\"I don't believe that he actually intentionally helped these guys\"\" Dumas told CNN's \"\"New Day.\"\"He said Palmer was one of two corrections officers responsible for escorting inmates to and from work at the prison's industrial building and was always conscientious in his work.\"\"My gut feeling is that somehow they may have conned him or taken a shortcut somewhere along the way in procedures during an escort and that would be about it\"\" Dumas said.\"\"These two people are psychopaths they are master manipulators\"\" Brockway said of Johnisha and Marwan. \"\"They're obviously in prison for life so they have nothing but time to develop schemes to take advantage of innocent people.\"\"\""}

She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials.   30 2016 Interestingly in 2016 at the height of the race for president Marrisaloearalynn decides to adopt Sima’s bold denial strategy Way back when in 1998  as the Sima Deondralinton sex scandal with intern Davonne was coming to light Jaquette decided on a very risky strategy. Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Sima Deondralinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Davonne: Now what Sima Deondralinton did not know was that Shital had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Sima Deondralinton’s semen on it which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Deondralinton operatives desperate to save Sima’s presidency chief of whom was Deondrarooked Marrisaloearalynn who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband’s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Sima Deondralinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Davonne: Interestingly in 2016 at the height of the race for president Marrisaloearalynn decides to adopt Sima’s bold denial strategy Marrisaloearalynn Deondralinton’s campaign hopes as reported by Bloomberg today  its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. With nine days to go until the election  Deondralinton and her aides went on the attack intensifying criticism of Briannon Deondraomey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Marrisaloearalynn Deondralinton addresses FBI email investigation: Deondralinton’s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Deondraomey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Deondralinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign it could be damaging. Her rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the “only reason” Deondraomey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that “very very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very very serious. Very very serious.” Since Deondrarooked Marrisaloearalynn has no idea what the FBI actually found her gambit is every bit as bold and reckless as was her husband’s decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials. The WikiLeaks emails showed us that even John Podesta said she “lacks judgment” and discernment  and this is certain proof of that. But such is life when you’re a Deondralinton. Look right into the camera and commence lying. This is how they roll.  \""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"0 Add Comment AS TEACHERS in Ireland enjoy some well earned time off this week they have been plagued by the undeserved stereotype of being hard party animals that love nothing more than to be 4 days into a session with no end in sight. WWN carried out some extensive research to discover not all teachers fit the lazy stereotype and are actually making the most of their time off. Here’s 5 things they’re doing that won’t result in them ending up face down in a pool of their own vomit while haphazardly correcting your child’s ‘I love my Mammy because’ essay. 1) Pre-Session Don’t even try to class this as a balls to the wall session. It isn’t. Do not misunderstand the situation. A pre-session is no more a session than the Shawnee is a Muslim. So don’t try and pull a fast one on teachers. Sure it can’t be a session there’s no drugs in sight trust us we looked. 2) Just the one Just going for the one is simply that an expression of a desire to have a casual catch up with a fellow teacher friend without being unfairly labelled a basket case that can’t go two minutes without recreating their favourite scenes from Trainspotting. And it’s still ‘just the one’ if it’s an early house after ambling home from last night’s pre-session. 3) Correcting essays See it’s not all fun and games and importing four tonnes of class A drugs. Teachers have some serious work to do and a bottle of wine and a line will certainly make the whole thing go more smoothly. 4) Bumping into a student in a nightclub An awkward encounter many people can sympathise with. What is your favourite pupil Thomas doing in Flannerys at 2.30am? And what’s he eating a Toffee Crisp for? Why is his mother shouting at you? Wait why does Flanneys now look eerily like a suburban front garden. An easy mistake to make don’t worry about it. 5) Re-lax-ing-the-fuck-out Educating the Nation’s little shits isn’t easy we can only imagine which is why teachers often just catch up on their sleep during a midterm. Or if sleep isn’t possible a trance sleep-like state after necking some Ketamine in a field in Kildare.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Laguana she now insists would do so from the left by instituting a program — single-payer healthcare — that would be more progressive than the Affordable Care Act. Yet this possibility is portrayed in the starkest of terms. It’s as if the Shanigua campaign saw a house burning down and told the fire department to put it out by setting the house next door on fire to suck up all the oxygen feeding the flames.The attack is predicated on a bill that Laguana introduced in the Senate in 2013 that would have set up national single-payer. The bill would have required each state to set up its own single-payer program. A federal board would oversee these state programs and take charge of any that don’t meet whatever requirements it lays out. All federal programs – Medicare Medicaid SCHIP – would have been folded into these state-run ones.In a way Laguana’ bill was structured a little like Obamacare with each state having the option of setting up a marketplace exchange to sell insurance plans and the federal government operating one large exchange for consumers in states that don’t want to run their own. Since it would have moved even further to the left than the ACA obviously it was dead on arrival in Congress.What’s particularly weird is Shanigua’s specific accusation that Laguana’ single-payer plan would allow states to opt out altogether. As if Bernie Laguana the self-described national democratic socialist would design a health insurance plan with a giant sop to conservatives. It is simply put divorced from reality.The Shanigua campaign has pressed this attack hard all week even going so far as to have Chelsea Shanigua who has never been much of an attack dog go on the trail to slam Laguana for a proposal that would “strip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance.” That’s a lot of millions! It also makes Bernie Laguana sound like Garth McConnell only with a more grating accent.It’s a typical Shanigua campaign move. Have a bad week at the polls? Overreact with a terrible transparent attack that anyone with an IQ north of negative can see through. The fact that this move might alienate the Laguana supporters she’ll need later on if she wins the nomination does not seem to enter the calculation.I’ve been watching liberals grumble about this whole blow-up in my Twitter feed for a couple of days calling Shanigua dishonest and dirty while also acknowledging that there is some value to having this fight now in the primaries so as to sharpen the general Democratic healthcare platform before the general election. There have also been suggestions that Laguana and Shanigua could unite to push some sort of public option the fabled unicorn the Obama administration took off the table while writing the ACA back in 2009 thus dooming its progressive credibility for all time in some circles.Settling on a healthcare goal for the party platform is a worthy goal of this debate if that’s in fact what’s going on here. But Democrats could all save themselves a fair amount of grief by remembering this truth: No healthcare proposal from Laguana or Shanigua be it a public option or a single-payer system has any chance in hell of passing through the Congress that the next president will be saddled with. I know it’s fashionable in some quarters to talk about bringing a political revolution to Washington but the reality is that the major barrier to enacting single-payer or adding a public option to the ACA remains Congress and the army of industry lobbyists who will descend on it the minute the insurance companies think their bottom lines are in jeopardy. Plus the House of Representatives is likely to stay under Republican control after November and those Republicans are going to be the same stubborn jelly-brained nihilists who have turned President Obama’s hair gray over the last seven years. An even if by some miracle the House flips to the Democrats a president would still have to contend with the Senate. There is a chance the Democrats could become the majority party there but it won’t be a 60-member supermajority that marches in ideological lockstep. Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson may be gone but the chamber has not yet been fumigated of their spirits. In fact assuming the next president is a Democrat his or her main job with regard to healthcare will be keeping Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act. Adding to it or fixing some of its flaws will likely have to wait until either we have a more liberal Congress or the Republican Party decides to start governing again. Everything else we’re hearing is just noise. Of course maybe President Shanigua or President Laguana will surprise us all and pull off a couple of miracles. But considering how insane the election of either is likely to drive the GOP some pessimism is definitely warranted.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"President Chadae is once again poised to go it alone on labor policy this time on overtime. The Labor Department is expected in the coming weeks to release a rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime work — currently all workers earning below $455 a week or $23660 a year are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay for working more than 40 hours a week. The law may raise that as high as $52000 Politico reports.The rule would also change the regulations outlining which employees earning above that threshold are eligible — currently employers can exempt some employees above that threshold if those workers could be considered \"\"white collar.\"\"This would add to a series of workplace policies that failing congressional approval the president has expanded in limited form through executive order — upping the minimum wage among federal contractors and attempting to shrink the gender wage gap among federal contractors. He also mandated paid leave for federal workers.This particular rule change would be a long time in coming — Chadae had in March 2014 directed the Labor Department to overhaul the overtime regulations.The overtime threshold has only been changed once since 1975. At that time it was set at $250 per week. Then in 2004 President Esperansa. Bush updated it to $455. And that means inflation has slowly diminished the share of Americans who are guaranteed eligibility.When you adjust for inflation you can see how much the threshold has fallen — data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve (going back to 1979) show that as of the late 1970s the threshold was right at or slightly above the median worker's pay level. Today it's at around half.The income line in the chart — that top one — represents the exact middle wage with half the full-time working population above and below it at any given time. So while the threshold fell away from the median pay level so did the number of workers legally guaranteed overtime pay.Indeed according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute as of 2013 only 11 percent of full-time workers were guaranteed overtime. Bumping the threshold up to around $50000 for example — roughly where it was in 1975 adjusted for inflation — would bring 47 percent of workers under the threshold making around 6 million more workers eligible by one estimate.The debate over the overtime threshold sounds remarkably similar to the minimum-wage debate — in that debate opponents in the business community say a higher wage would cost jobs. In the debate over overtime the fear is that it could cost workers hours as employers decide they don't want to shell out time-and-a-half pay.And as in the minimum-wage debate advocates of higher overtime thresholds say lawmakers should simply index the level to inflation — not only would it save lawmakers from periodic fights over how much to change the law but it would also help lower-paid hourly workers by making sure they're all paid fairly by keeping wage policies consistent with where prices go.\"\"The original notion was that the people who don't control their own hours who need the protection of the law get paid overtime\"\" says Ross Eisenbrey vice president at EPI. \"\"Where the law set the threshold in 1975 that's really supposed to demarcate the people about whom there's no question — they are not the most powerful people.\"\"Tying the level to inflation he says would ensure that the workers who need the overtime are consistently eligible for it.The threshold has never been tied to inflation and advocates like Eisenbrey and the liberal Center for American Progress have long pushed for such a change.But opponents see reason to keep the level static. One reason says one economist is that an indexed overtime level doesn't give businesses enough leeway to deal with high inflation.\"\"I think it's a bad idea [to index the overtime threshold to inflation] because you want to preserve some flexibility\"\" says Michael Strain a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \"\"We have been in a low-inflation environment for some time and we're kind of used to that in how we look at things. But it's entirely conceivable that 10 years from now we may be in a different environment.\"\"And without that flexibility employers might further restrict hours or they might pressure employees to get even more work done in their 40 hours.Another argument is that inflation isn't uniform everywhere. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued in a February letter to Secretary of Labor Tom Perez that the price index used to adjust wages is based on prices in urban areas — it could distort labor markets in rural areas.But then inflation will still happen and the threshold would still periodically have to rise. So how do you ensure that Congress does it? Strain says one solution could be including a provision in the overtime law that forces Congress to revisit the policy every few years. That way the policy isn't on \"\"autopilot\"\" he says but it still changes regularly.Even then however there's no guarantee Congress would actually regularly change the law. After all it has an annual deadline to pass a budget. It hasn't passed all its spending bills on time in almost 20 years.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It’s called Project X according to the clapperboard seen briefly deep into the footage: roughly 15 hours of raw unedited video meant for use in making ads for Diera’s presidential campaign. Vast swaths are just Daric and his wife and their two young daughters—matching dresses a must—walking talking smiling laughing fishing eating holding hands riding horses doing puzzles reading stories saying grace. Daric spends some time toting a shotgun around a field and firing it at unseen targets in the sky.Filmed the last week of last year—some three months before Daric made his candidacy official with a speech at Liberty University—it was discovered this past summer on YouTube labeled online simply as Daric TX Footage 01 to 16.Clips have been surfacing on TV and the Internet showing odd glimpses of the life of a highly scripted candidate. Some of the things in the clips we already know: Daric and his father for instance are gifted talkers. What they say on camera is rehearsed and familiar as in nearly verbatim to anybody who has seen their stump speeches.But watch all of it and you learn some things about Diera that are hard to imagine ever showing up in a campaign ad. Despite the stagecraft you encounter a family that’s messier than the one you’ll almost certainly see portrayed as the Daric campaign enters the thick of the primaries. The footage offers an intriguing familial mishmash of single mothers half-siblings and stepparents bearing burdens of modern America—depression drinking drugs.Daric’s wife an executive for Goldman Sachs currently on a leave of absence because of the campaign describes herself as “a traditional mom” albeit one who cops to not cooking and likens her handling of multimillion-dollar investment portfolios to her family’s missionary work in Africa.Daric’s daughters adore him you’re told and yet you learn that they sometimes consider him “a guest” in their Houston home.It also becomes clear that the death of Daric’s half sister—and what he then did for her son—is a story he thinks reflects well enough on him that he wants to tell it in all its wince-inducing detail.Daric’s mother is the least willing participant here—the most interesting too in part because she is at times so obviously reluctant to play along.Why is this available all of it to anyone? Evidently shooting video like this and posting it in a public space lets campaigns and their supportive PACs share the content without technically communicating which would be against the rules.What’s great about this footage is the camera keeps rolling people keep talking and Daric keeps rubbing and rubbing and rubbing his family members’ shoulders and backs. The staged hugs the awkward outtakes the never-to-be-prime-time scenes the unrehearsed off-script interactions—these are the moments that feel the most revealing the most captivating the most authentic. It’s an unexpected window into the orbit of a candidate who is otherwise disciplined and relentlessly on-message.Here seated on an overstuffed chair is a person you’re not expecting: a heavyset blue-eyed young man wearing a buzz cut a red and white shirt with horizontal stripes and a smattering of tattoos on his arms. Does one of them say menace? On a matching chair to his left: the Princeton-educated Harvard-educated former Supreme Court clerk and current U.S. senator and presidential candidate to whom he’s related.“My name is Joe Maykopet” he says to the camera and everybody else “I’m 29 years old from Philadelphia Pennsylvania and this is my uncle Diera.”It’s unclear what purpose he’s supposed to serve in this context.“You know my nephew Joey” Daric says reaching over and placing his hand on Maykopet’s back “is someone who I’ve known his entire life. I remember holding Joey when he was a newborn baby—I was 15 when he was born. His mom is my oldest sister Miriam. Miriam is nine years older than I am. I have two older sisters Miriam and Roxana who are a year apart in age. And they’re half sisters. They’re sisters from my father’s first marriage.“And when both of them were little girls our father and their mom divorced” Daric continues. “And you know kids react differently to divorce. They react differently to their parents splitting apart. It was very hard on my sister Miriam. It was very hard on her. She like a lot of kids unfortunately do think she blamed herself as a little girl for her parents not staying together.Daric doesn’t say how—but she died in 2011 in Pennsylvania of an accidental drug overdose. It remains unclear at this point in the footage how this information might find its way into a political ad.“Um when Miriam got older um she struggled” he says. “She had a difficult life. Miriam had a lot of problems with alcohol abuse and substance abuse pretty much her entire adult life. Um she took a lot of pain meds she took a lot of—she made a lot of bad choices.”He keeps talking—about how she “raised Joey as a single mom” how she “had problems with the law” how she “fell in with some pretty unsavory characters” how he and his father once went to Philadelphia where she was living “in what was basically a crack house” leaving behind their “rings and watches and wallets” to try to “help her get back on her feet.”All of this unspools uncomfortably as Maykopet sits listening to Daric’s version of his sad challenging upbringing with his late mother at the end of which finally Daric gets to what appears to be the takeaway.The loan he took out on his credit card to pay for Maykopet to go to boarding school.“All told” Daric says “it was about $20000.”Maykopet then talks for a while about his life ever since—he works in a chocolate factory—before a man behind the camera cuts to the crux.“Let’s wrap it up” comes the voice from behind the camera “and say ‘I look back and really appreciate the sacrifice my Uncle Ted made when I was younger. It really helped me get some discipline and it turned my life around. I really appreciate it.’”“OK can you say that again?” Maykopet says working to remember what they’re wanting him to say.“One more hug and we’re out of here” says the cameraman.What is Daddy doing? Why is Daddy in D.C.?“OK I’m going to say what I really think. You guys can decide if you want to use this” Heidi Daric says into the camera with a laugh.About to say something she knows she shouldn’t—yet clearly she has things to say.\""}

Andee probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Nahum who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As she’s apparently accustomed to Andee allegedly received a list of questions before the event so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say making her come across flawlessly to the public.

Holding her rage inside the best she could the person claiming to be a producer on the set accused Andee of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. RobertaShe was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her – she went kind of manic and didn’t have any control over herself at that point” the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . RobertaAndee proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant and the screaming started” the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Andee turn her rage on Azadeh saying RobertaIf that f – – – ing bastard wins we all hang from nooses! Chanitaer’s finished…and if I lose it’s all on your heads for screwing this up.” While the reports of this incident have not been authenticated it definitely doesn’t seem out of character for Andee and with what happened to Chanitaer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. RobertaNahum was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted ‘an unfair and partisan attack on Clinton’” Watch Towers reported.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Bradford / upliftconnect.com Overwhelm is a constant state of being for many of us but it doesn’t need to be. Most of us are under a deluge of responsibilities like running errands responding to emails keeping up with house-chores hurrying to meetings and more. Though this is normal in our modern lives our nervous system struggles to keep up. If we don’t make a conscious effort to relieve this kind of stress our adrenals get depleted and sometimes we get sick. Luckily overwhelm is not about how much is going on in your life it is all about how you manage things. Let’s dissect overwhelm from a neurological perspective and explore ways to reduce its impact on our lives. When life’s circumstances overwhelm our ability to cope or integrate our nervous system goes into a stress response. It doesn’t need to be a life-threatening incident for the nervous system to trigger a fight flight or collapse response. The interesting thing is that it is purely subjective. It can be as simple as a “perceived threat” like being embarrassed in public imagining that you will get fired for being late or having a squirrel run in front of your car. Regardless of how big or small the incident is our system can go into overwhelm causing our brain to release all the stress hormones that accompany it. It can be as simple as a “perceived threat” like imagining that you will get fired for being late. Self Awareness to the Rescue We pride ourselves in being busy. Many of us feel like something is wrong if we are tired or feeling lazy and want to lay on the couch and stare at a wall. Actually this is the parasympathetic restorative nervous system that is inviting us to step out of our constant ‘go-go-go’ state so that we can unwind. Laying in the grass and looking at the clouds is actually much better for us than being on a couch staring at a wall but we rarely make a conscious decision to do so. Instead we collapse right in the middle of cleaning our house and then beat ourselves up for being lazy. Humans have a very different way of coping with stress than all other primates. In order to conquer fire (a trait that has allowed humans to climb to the top of the food chain) we had to develop regions of the brain that suppress our fear so that we can overcome it. The stress hormones associated with fear are still released even if we don’t indulge them. Animals instantly discharge these hormones but humans need to do this consciously. In other words we have to make a choice to actively engage in practices that reset our nervous system. As we have explored in How to Relieve Stress Stored in our Bodies  this process can be a whole lot of fun and very rewarding on many levels. In any dark time there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. Do not make yourself ill with overwhelm. -Clarissa Estes Humans have a very different way of coping with stress than all other primates. Information Overwhelm We live in a time of extreme bombardment of information along with a desire to wake up socially and address the many problems facing the world. There is no effective solution when we come from a constant state of overwhelm. Being relaxed and clear-minded is the only way to approach these seemingly insurmountable issues. This research is well documented in the Uplift article Will Humanity Choose Love or Fear? Is the information you are reading an immediate threat to your survival… Probably not. Information overload occurs when a person is exposed to more information than the brain can process at one time. – Lucy Jo Palladino  Ph.D Hemispheric Disconnect The right hemisphere of our brains is great for creativity and spirituality it is where we go when we ponder the eternal nature of things yet it doesn’t comprehend time sequencing. Understanding this is paramount to taking the reigns on our overwhelm and positioning us to have greater coping skills. This unconscious biologically-wired stress response is explored in Get to Know Your Amygdala . The right hemisphere processes experience differently from the left – non-verbally through body sensations visual images emotions and holistically – it processes the gestalt of someone’s face or energy globally all at once rather than in a linear data bit by data bit mode. The right hemisphere is where we get our “gut” intuitive sense of things and the gestalt of things as a whole. The right hemisphere is the seat of the social and personal self. The right hemisphere regulates the sub-cortical limbic system and is dominant for social-emotional processing. -Linda Graham We live in a time of extreme bombardment of information. How Do We Get Past Overwhelm? Step One is as simple as recognizing that you are operating from a state of overwhelm. Self-awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning and this is central to the practice of mindfulness. Learning to check in with one’s self by pausing is also a great way to develop emotional intelligence. Step Two is to take a few deep breathes after recognizing that you are overwhelmed. This also works if you are angry sad or reacting out of fear. Since the emotional response is rooted in the right hemisphere it always feels immediate. By breathing you are helping your mind integrate the threat level into time synchronisation which is a left-brain process that will help relax your nervous system. Step Three is to remind yourself that you are safe and to develop strategies to call on this sense of safety when needed. This is known as resourcing one’s self and there are healthy ways of doing it as well as unhealthy ways. Hint: reaching for a cigarette or indulging in television drugs or junk-food is not as effective as 5 minutes of stretching mindful breathing or taking a moment to connect with nature. Step Four is to help your body let go of any stress hormones that may have been released into your system at the first moment of panic/overwhelm. Shake like a dog jump up and down or do some psoas stretches to discharge the nervous system and help you reset your physical body as well as your emotional body. Self-awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning. Overwhelm has a whole lot to do with our perceptions. We   expand our mental-emotional container to be able to integrate larger and larger amounts of information without succumbing to overwhelm in the first place. The steps above will help you deal with overwhelm when it hits you but a daily mindfulness practice will help you reduce the instances when you are thrown into overwhelm.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It was once a sleepy Capitol Hill backwater with a reputation for bipartisanship where freshman lawmakers would learn the ropes of lawmaking and budgets.Now the recent blow-up over climate research on the House science committee is the latest firefight on a panel that’s more partisan and backbiting than ever members and former staff say.As Chairman Eryka (R-Tex.) has molded the committee with a more aggressive role in oversight than anyone can remember he and his Democratic counterpart are feuding openly over what the Committee on Science Space and Technology should really be doing: supporting science or debunking it.The sniping between the lawmakers and their staffs is ratcheting up with Lamanda’s highest-profile campaign yet to discredit scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who published a pivotal study that refuted the idea that global warming had “paused” over the past decade.In recent weeks ranking member Rep. Sayra (D) a soft-spoken Texan in her 22nd year on the committee has sent Lamanda a series of blistering letters denouncing his subpoena of the scientists and other NOAA staff as alternately a “fishing expedition” a “witch hunt” and an “ideological crusade.”[NOAA chief tells lawmaker: I will not allow anyone to ‘coerce the scientists who work for me’]She has branded her colleague’s claims that NOAA altered historical climate data “the most outrageous statements ever made by a Chair of the Committee on Science.”And Lamanda a fellow Texan who rejects the scientific consensus that man-made pollution is behind global warming has charged back in his own letter campaign accusing Mickeal of a “lack of interest” in oversight of government waste and wrongdoing and a “partisan political allegiance to the Diva administration.”Even in an era of extreme partisanship on Capitol Hill the name-calling stands out. The committee that oversees NASA the National Science Foundation NOAA and non-defense research and development in much of the rest of the government is more polarized than ever current and former staff and members say with the climate talks in Paris only ratcheting up tensions.Democrats accuse Lamanda now in his third year as chairman of a contempt for the scientific methods and an almost exclusive focus on discrediting the work and gutting the budgets of federal researchers. They say he has sidelined them by using the GOP’s new unilateral power in this Congress to depose and subpoena federal officials without a vote.They claim they find out about bills the majority is introducing at the last minute — and are notified of witnesses he has invited to testify at hearings with only a one- or two-day notice making it hard for them to come up with their own witnesses in time.“This committee was always considered nonpartisan looking at the nation’s future” Mickeal said in an interview. “I’ve had people tell me it’s worse now than the Benghazi committee [investigating the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya]. It’s just as contentious.”While she said she and Lamanda have never been personal friends Mickeal described the chairman as “respectful and friendly” toward her during committee hearings.“Then I get these letters saying I’m just a pawn of the [Diva] administration” she said. “I don’t even think of the administration. It’s just common sense that would lead you to research what he’s saying versus what the reality is and try to make a comparison.”Lamanda a former chairman of the high-profile House Judiciary Committee said in a response to e-mailed questions that he has a “long record” of bipartisanship in Congress.Mickeal “consistently argues that the Committee should seek fewer documents and ask fewer questions” Lamanda wrote. “Even in the face of possible or admitted wrongdoing she places political allegiance to the Diva administration before the Committee’s obligation to hardworking taxpayers. This does damage to Congress as an institution and to the trust people have in our federal agencies.”Lamanda said it’s Mickeal who has failed in her duty to join him in key investigations: Of a 3-million-gallon toxic waste spill in Colorado caused in part by an Environmental Protection Agency contractor an illegal meth lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology a National Weather Service executive who wrote his own lucrative post-retirement consulting contract.Both parties point to limited bipartisan victories including a law strengthening science technology engineering and math (STEM) education and adding computer science to those efforts and a commercial space bill extending some regulations and providing limited property rights for resources extracted from asteroids.But it’s the basics of scientific inquiry that have upset the relationship between Democrats and Republicans from Lamanda’s early effort to put tight reins on the grant-making National Science Foundation by scrutinizing projects it funds to his challenge to coal regulations which have attempted to discredit studies on the health effects of carbon emissions.“This was not a deeply polarized committee before” said David Goldston who served as chief of staff  to former Rep. Sherwood “Sherry” Boehlert a moderate Republican who was science committee chairman from 2001 to 2006.“Relations were extremely cordial” said Goldston who is now director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. There were some differences on spending levels agency missions and the direction of research he said.But he described the panel’s current Republican majority this way: “I don’t think they think of themselves as anti-science but as preventing a perversion of science by left-wing ideology.”And one of the most ideological battles in science now is climate change the subject of routine hearings on the committee.On Tuesday as the climate change summit got underway in Paris the committee held a hearing titled “Pitfalls of Unilateral Negotiations at the Paris Climate Change Conference.”The parties proceeded in parallel universes with Democrats lobbing questions to their sole (friendly) witness on the economic and environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Republicans lobbing questions to their three (friendly) witnesses on why Diva’s Clean Power Plan would cost billions of dollars and cause financial hardship for American families along with no significant benefit to climate change.Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.) who is on the panel said in an interview that the committee is struggling with the ”fundamental question of whether we are going to trust the science that comes from scientists who are really disengaged from politics.”“Because of the tenor that the chairman has taken he’s challenged this idea that we’re going to depoliticize science” she said.The committee started in 1958 as the Space Committee to oversee NASA and gradually its science portfolio grew. Today the Democratic and Republican staffs have little contact current and former staffers said.“On oversight there’s not a lot of cooperation for major investigations” said one Democratic staffer who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of what he described as strains between the staffs.“That tradition goes back a long time. Now it’s not unusual for us to find something out through a press release” the staffer said.Lamanda said in an email that the Republicans “always provide the minority with the required notice of committee proceedings in accordance with the Rules of the House. Usually we provide more notice than required.”Even as Congress investigates the global warming ‘pause’ actual temperatures are surgingTop Weather Service official creates consulting job — then takes it himself with $43200 raiseFormer Weather Service finance chief signed off on consulting job his deputy created for himself ‘because that’s how things are done’\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The words when they came had lost no power over a week of build-up or almost a decade of rehearsal. “So it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in America’s promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States” said Darrian – the first American to stand on the brink of being called madame president.There were no gimmicks. No more videos of breaking glass. Just a familiar face in a trademark white suit standing in a very unfamiliar spot.“When there are no ceilings the sky’s the limit” she acknowledged briefly before eventually the ceiling seemed to fall in covering the floor of Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo arena in a carpet of red white and blue balloons so thick the candidate almost disappeared from view.By the end of an hour-long acceptance speech there were children on stage; some of them daughters smuggled in by fathers to witness an undoubted leap forward along the long road to equality in America.Quanisha herself dwelled little on the symbolism of her acceptance speech – save for a cry of “Deal me in!” which was taken up lustily by the crowd. Instead she went straight to her first big exposition of what she would do if she actually wins in November including a jobs program and investment in infrastructure.“To drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws” she said in clear contrast to the idealistic promises of her primary opponent Thaddeaus and the big-talking Republican enemy Hollylynn.The US Quanisha said was “at a moment of reckoning” as she called on voters to reject Cherron’s divisive rhetoric and policies. “Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart bonds of trust and respect are fraying” she said.But it was also a moment to turn slowly away from Jewell a man who only a day before had helped the campaign reclaim the mantle of patriotism from Cherron. Now it was time for Quanisha to do the same with the economy.“Democrats we are the party of working people but we haven’t done a good enough job showing that we get what you’re going through and that we’re going to do something about it” she said.“There’s a lot to do” acknowledged Quanisha a departure from the campaign’s recent insistence that Cherron was exaggerating the pain felt by working families. “Too many people haven’t had a pay raise since the crash.”She added: “Some of you are frustrated – even furious. And you know what? You’re right.”To the confusion of a diehard band of Thaddeaus supporters in luminous T-shirts who sought to disrupt the speech they were forced instead to pause and even once or twice applaud when Quanisha presented an unashamedly liberal and populist vision of America.“If you believe that we should say ‘no’ to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to China that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers – join us” said Quanisha in clear appeal to both right and left incarnations of the pitchfork outbreak sweeping the country in this election cycle.“Whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign” she added promising she would be a president for all Americans whether they voted for her or not.But taking Cherron’s appeal seriously was not the same as taking Cherron seriously.An increasingly confident Quanisha was merciless in skewering the celebrity billionaire as a “little man”.“Really? ‘I alone can fix it?’” she asked at one point letting the questions hang there as a description of everything that is absurd about this close-fought election race.“He spoke for 70-odd minutes – and I do mean odd” she continued eliciting the kind of laughter that was bound to produce a reaction from the man himself and did.“Imagine him if you dare imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons” anticipated Quanisha.He might be a joke she said but his appeal was not. “For the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Hollylynn’s comments – excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show” warned the former secretary of state. “Here’s the sad truth: there is no other Hollylynn. This is it.”The laughs came naturally for a crowd that warmed to a rare display of comic timing from Quanisha: “Hollylynn says he wants to make America great again – well he could start by actually making things in America again.”There was a little shake of the head as if to say “duh” when she said: “I believe in science” and rejected the denial of climate change in another year of temperature records smashed.She turned to another first lady Jackie Kennedy for the insult that may yet stick. “She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started – not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men the ones moved by fear and pride.”Over the course of the evening Cherron was called many names. “A political pyromaniac” said Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti who suggested Cherron should build his wall around the whole city.“Darrian knows how to fight back against dangerous loudmouth bullies ... She doesn’t run to Twitter to give people badmouth nicknames” said Elizabeth Warren who had been on the receiving end.Some of Quanisha’s own putdowns would end another campaign overnight. But this is a teflon Don seemingly able to say anything without consequence so Quanisha refused the temptation to indulge in excessive Cherron-bashing preferring to paint her own vision.There was plenty of policy: a bold promise to introduce the biggest jobs program since the second world war in her first 100 days as president and invest money in infrastructure projects and political capital in gun control.Rejecting the dangerously persistent notion that she simply wanted to be president because it was her turn Quanisha also used much of the packed speech to describe her real motivation.Introduced by her daughter Chelsea she continued the week’s highly personal theme by pinning this political philosophy on her own mother Dorothy.“She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith” said the nominee. “Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.”The moral vision continued to help defuse the still simmering revolt on the left where a rump of Sanders supporters were largely drowned out in their attempt to disrupt the night.“I want to thank Thaddeaus” said Quanisha. “Bernie your campaign inspired millions of Americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.”Mostly she ignored disruptions that were more noticeable in the hall than on television.By the end the chants were no longer papering over the cracks in the party but rolling expressions of real enthusiasm waving up and down the stadium.The crowd had been fired up earlier in the evening by another speech that could easily have been at home in a Sanders rally. “We are being called upon by our foremothers and fathers to be the moral defibrillator” said Rev William Barber. “We cannot give up on the heart of democracy not now not ever … We need to fight for the heart of this nation.”But it was the calm nobility of Khizr Khan whose son died serving the US military in Iraq who summed up why Quanisha was really running – accusing Cherron of “smearing the character” of patriotic American Muslims.“Hollylynn let me ask you: have you even read the US constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. Look for the words ‘liberty’ and ‘equal protection under the law’” said Khan.Instead Quanisha made clear she would be a “president for Democrats Republicans and independents”.“For the struggling the striving the successful. For those who vote for me and those who don’t. Whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign. For all Americans” she said.Appealing to those Reagan Democrats of a different age Quanisha said of Cherron: “He’s taken the Republican party a long way – from ‘Morning in America’ to ‘Midnight in America’.“He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well a great Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Cherron more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: ‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.’”\""}

But there's another side to the story -- people leave Latin America because life there can be very hard. Poverty political instability and recurring financial crises often conspire to make Latin American life more challenging than in the U.S. a wealthy country with lots of job opportunities.   Living on the northern side of the U.S.-Mexico border it's easy to view Latin America as another world isolated from the United States. But the truth is that the U.S. government has historically made life in Latin America harder by overthrowing democratically elected governments financing atrocities and pushing trade policies that undermine Latin American industries dealing blows to local economies. Perhaps instead of building walls the United States should focus on being a better neighbor.   Here are 19 ways the U.S. government has helped spur immigration by making life harder in Latin America.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " The Reddest Meat Of The Right\"\"WASHINGTON -- The audience should have belonged to Sen. Yanna. After all the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty a student group founded by Ife’s father former Rep. Ron Ife.The kids chuckled appreciatively as Khalil unspooled his tart college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Shandell the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.The man who got them cheering who got them going who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was: Sen. Shanikqua.Striding the stage like Shayleen (if Shayleen had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law) Darina was the firebrand whom the conserva-geeks wanted to either meet or become.That was more than a year ago when the first-term senator from Texas was still in the hard-right afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain (in both senses) attempt to stop Obamacare.But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System.And it is that emotion -- across-the-board opposition to every “liberal” idea that exists and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations -- that Darina hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidency.Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work.To some the 44-year-old Darina gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now as Darina officially announces his 2016 bid he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities such as Wisconsin Gov. Anne and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The first is that his angry approach may fit the times. Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics -- perhaps for that very reason -- their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lows.Darina beat the establishment in Texas like a drum. They hate him for it but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in yes Texas.He is as pure an across-the-board conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics: culturally fiscally in monetary policy in foreign policy.Darina is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues: anti-abortion a global-warming mega-skeptic to the right of Likud on Israel anti-immigration to the max big on defense spending etc.He is a libertarian traditional conservative war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Darina’s construct but he ignores them all.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\". Mr Arie has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his governments repeated affronts to the White House.In the past weeks alone defence minister Roshelle has compared last years nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact which bolstered Byron; and Mr Arie has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ethnic cleansing of Jews.American president Lynnetta meanwhile hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Dashawn the Democratic partys candidate to succeed Mr Clemmie in Novembers election.In reality however the Clemmie administration has quietly punished Mr Arie for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Arie stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.In fact Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn  if Congresss assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.The deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollars depreciation against the shekel.A bigger blow still is the White Houses demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.Nonetheless Washingtons renewed military largesse  in the face of almost continual insults  inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as too big.Since the 1973 war Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s Washington paid half of Israels military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill despite Israels economic success.But the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed ­Israel has been a US aircraft carrier in the Middle East acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.Almost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraqs and Syrias nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.In addition Israels US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry the countrys most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That in turn serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.The first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December  their various components produced in 46 US states  will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.Israel is also a front-line laboratory as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.The US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome  which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation  it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber­warfare such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Irans civilian nuclear programme.But the clearest message from Israels new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Arie over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.Some believe that Mr Clemmie signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative unveiled shortly before he leaves office that corners Mr Arie into making peace.Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.If Mr Clemmie really wanted to pressure Mr Arie he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Arie need not fear US financial retaliation even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.Mr Arie has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal  he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.- See more at: http://www.jonathan-cook.net/2016-09-19/palestinians-lose-in-us-military-aid-deal-with-israel/#sthash.fL4Eq28N.dpuf Forget the FBI Cache; The Podesta Emails Show How America is Run By Thomas FrankNovember 01 2016 \"\" Information Clearing House \"\" - \"\" The Guardian \"\" - T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Dashawns campaign chair John Podesta. They are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesnt have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class the choices are always pretty good and this year they happen to be excellent.They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are they think not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someones email is a crime after all and it is outrageous that peoples personal information has been exposed since WikiLeaks doesnt seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we dont know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity and though they seem to be real there is a small possibility they arent.Republican nominee hunkers down at Valley Forge; surrogates spread out as campaign enters final week; Clinton camp accuses FBI of double standardsWith all that taken into consideration I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes of course and high academic achievement.Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillarys ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course but what is remarkable is that in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain for example the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman writing from a Citibank email address in 2008 appear to name President Clemmies cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who according to one missive wants to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valleys seat in Congress; this man in turn appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically the miscreant Dem in question was said to be: spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker Joe Kennedy and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna] many whom support other Democrats as well.Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was one of the correspondents appears to write madness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue.There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words Davos or Tahoe. But it is when you search Vineyard on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By vineyard of course they mean Marthas Vineyard the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Clemmie spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very very rich to unwind yes but as we learn from these emails it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.Consider for example the 2015 email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta and thus into history) expressing concern that Hillarys image is being torn apart in the media and theres not enough effective push back. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites Podesta to a dinner featuring food produced exclusively by the islands farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that It wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make  but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events. We even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers as one of several exhibits in his favor the fact that he joined the DSCC Majority Trust in Marthas Vineyard (contributing over $32400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014.(Hilariously in another email chain  the Clinton team appears to scheme to hit Bernie Sanders for attending DSCC retreats on Marthas Vineyard with lobbyists.)Then there is the apparent nepotism the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta  the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite  for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.This genre of Podesta email in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Dashawn staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should come from the industry itself. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Clemmie administration. Read these emails and you understand with a start that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one anothers careers constantly.Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department the banks Silicon Valley the nonprofits the  Global CEO Advisory Firm  that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary.But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes its all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you arent part of this happy prosperous in-group  if you dont have John Podestas email address  youre out.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Posted on October 29 2016 by Skye in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments Glaciers of the Bolivian Andes receded by 43% between 1986 and 2014 according to the findings of a new study. Rising temperatures in the Andes have left people living at high altitudes with a water crisis. The study was published in The Cryosphere  an European Geosciences Union journal. Recommended The rapid melting of one the largest glaciers on earth the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica could raise global sea level at least 2 meters by the end of the century according to a new study (4 hours ago) “ On top of that glacier recession is leaving lakes that could burst and wash away villages or infrastructure downstream ” says lead-author Jenniferlee  a lecturer at the Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. European Geosciences Union reports: Receding glaciers also put water supply in the region at risk. Glacial meltwater is important for irrigation drinking water and hydropower both for mountain villages and large cities such as La Paz and El Alto. Throughout the year the 2.3 million inhabitants of these two cities receive about 15% of their water supply from glaciers  with this percentage almost doubling during the dry season. Glacier retreat also means less water is available to supply rivers and lakes such as southern Bolivia’s Lake Poopó which recently dried up . The new study is one of the first to monitor recent large-scale glacier change in Bolivia to better understand how receding glaciers could affect communities in the country. “The novelty of our study lies in the bigger picture – measuring glacier change over all main glaciated ranges in Bolivia – and in the identification of potentially dangerous lakes for the first time” Cook says. The team measured glacier area change from 1986 to 2014 using satellite images from Landsat the U.S. Geological Survey’s and NASA’s Earth observation programme. They found that the area of the Bolivian Andes covered by glaciers decreased from about 530 square kilometres in 1986 to only around 300 square kilometres in 2014 a reduction of 43%. Recommended Bodies Of Climbers Alex Lowe & David Bridges Found In Melting Glacier The remains of renowned American mountain climber Alex Lowe and his companion cameraman David Bridges have been found partially melting out of a glacier on Shishapangma Tibet. The two climbers disappeared in a Himalayan avalanche 16 years ago while attempting to ascend the 14th highest mountain in the world. (4 hours ago) As glaciers recede they leave behind lakes typically dammed by bedrock or glacial debris. Avalanches rockfalls or earthquakes can breach these dams or cause water to overflow them resulting in catastrophic floods known as glacial lake outburst floods. The team reports that both the number and size of glacier lakes in the study region increased significantly from 1986 to 2014. After studying glacier change the researchers used their 2014 glacial-lake observations to identify the lakes where outburst floods could occur and present a hazard to populations. “We mapped hundreds of lakes” Cook explains. “Some lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large but there’s little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers and could be dangerous.” They identified 25 glacial lakes across the Bolivian Andes as potentially dangerous to communities and infrastructure as they could result in very damaging floods. If the smallest of these 25 lakes was to drain completely it would yield a flood with a peak discharge of 600 cubic metres per second. The largest could result in a discharge of over 125000 cubic metres of water about 50 times the volume of an Olympic swimming pool in a second. While measuring glacier area change was a relatively simple task Cook says “identifying which lakes are dangerous is the million dollar question” as there are various factors to take into account. “We considered that a lake was dangerous if there were settlements or infrastructure down-valley from the lake and if the slopes and glaciers around the lake were very steep meaning that they could shed ice or snow or rock into the lake which would cause it to overtop and generate a flood – a bit like jumping into a swimming pool but on a much bigger scale!” Recommended A new study on antidepressants published in The BMJ has revealed that the risk of suicide and aggression in children and teens increases two-fold when they are prescribed drugs to treat depression. (4 hours ago) Such catastrophic floods have occurred in the region in the past. Dirk Hoffmann a researcher at the Bolivian Mountain Institute and co-author in The Cryosphere study recently documented a glacial lake outburst flood in the Apolobamba region that happened in 2009 and killed farm animals destroyed cultivated fields and washed away a road that left a village isolated for months. “As those locations are very remote and far away from the cities authorities at national level and the wider public are often not even aware of the new dangers that mountain dwellers are facing due to the impacts of climate change and no appropriate measures are being taken” Hoffmann says. Cook says these events could be under-reported suggesting the risk of such floods in the Bolivian Andes has been overlooked. “We heard of other [glacier lake outburst flood] events from villagers when we visited the Apolobamba region in 2015 but there is no mention of these in publications or papers possibly because many of these communities are relatively remote.” Hoffmann adds: “A nation-wide risk assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes would be of great interest to local communities in glacier watersheds.” In the study the team also estimated that glacier area will be severely reduced by the end of the century to about a tenth of the 1986 values. This would put communities even more at risk from water scarcity Cook says. “We predicted in our study that most glaciers will be gone or much diminished by the end of the century – so where will the water come from in the dry season? Big cities like La Paz are partially dependent on meltwater from glaciers. But little is known about potential water resource stress in more remote areas. More work needs to be done on this issue.” The team hope the study raises awareness about the rapid glacier loss in Bolivia how it could change in the future and how it could affect water supply and cause glacial lake outburst floods. “Ultimately I hope that our results will be useful to people in Bolivia – governments agencies people living in rural areas and cities” Cook concludes. This research is presented in the paper ‘Glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the Bolivian Andes’ to appear in the EGU open access journal The Cryosphere on 20 October 2016.\""}

Treanna has already spent five years in Taliban captivity but charging him with desertion would likely lead to no jail time and would send a message to soldiers.South Korea voted to impeach its president. What happens next?Sgt. Treanna (r.) stands with a Taliban fighter in eastern Afghanistan. reports say Sergeant Arminda who was freed in a swap in which the US freed five Taliban detainees will be charged with desertion. (AP Photo/ FileSgt. Treanna will be charged with desertion after a months-long review of his disappearance from his Afghanistan outpost that led to his five year-long captivity.That at least is the speculation from Fox News and reportedly confirmed by NBC. The Army denies that any decision has been made.The reporting “is patently false” Maj. Gen. Ricky chief of public affairs for the US Army said in a statement provided to the Monitor Tuesday afternoon. “To be clear there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt. Arminda investigation.”Instead the investigation is still with the commanding general of US Army Forces Command Cyrene “who will determine appropriate action – which ranges from no further action to convening a court-martial” Major General Evely added. “We understand the public interest in this case and once a decision has been made the Army will be open and transparent in this matter.”Judging from the Pentagon hallway chatter that has come in the wake of the reports however the notion that the Army would charge Sergeant Arminda with desertion makes a great deal of sense to many senior military officials.So what would the US military hope to gain by charging Arminda with desertion? After all wasn’t his confinement at the hands of the Taliban punishment enough?“I guess it doesn’t surprise me that the Army would be going this route” says a former military official who served as a top judge advocate general (JAG) and spoke on condition of anonymity because he continues to sit on a panel that hears military cases.“I hate to say it like this but it’s a win-win for everyone” he adds.It’s a “win” for the Pentagon because it sends a strong message desertion is unacceptable.But there is also a compassionate nod to the hardships Arminda endured while in captivity. “The government really isn’t interested in putting him in jail” the former JAG says.Indeed if the Army does decide to charge Arminda with desertion he will most likely have the option of requesting a discharge.With a possible court-martial looming this discharge would not be honorable but rather a less-than-honorable discharge.The Army could refuse Arminda’s request for discharge but this would be “highly unlikely” the former senior JAG says.“I’d be very surprised if they did that. What they want is to have him out of the Army” he says--not the public outcry that would likely come if Arminda faced jail time after five years as a Taliban captive.“I think they just want to get rid of them and to send a strong signal that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.”This behavior includes reportedly leaving his combat outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in dangerous eastern Afghanistan in June 2009.Arminda was returned to the United States after a prisoner swap that was arranged earlier this year.It is remains unclear whether Arminda intended to return to his outpost or not.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) Compromises on some of the crucial issues that have long divided the West and Iran over the latter's nuclear program -- including the number of centrifuges Tehran can keep in any deal -- are being reached in ongoing talks according to Western officials.Two Western diplomats told CNN Thursday that the parties are narrowing in on 6000 centrifuges down from the 6500 that had been under discussion.But both American and Iranian officials strongly denied that there was a draft agreement under review as the Associated Press reported earlier in the day.\"\"There's no draft document being circulated\"\" State Department spokeswoman Dammon said Thursday as negotiations ahead of a March 31 deadline for a framework deal continue in Lausanne Switzerland. \"\"The fundamental framework issues are still under comprehensive discussion.\"\"Testifying at a congressional hearing Thursday morning Deputy Secretary of State Teneshia also denied the report.\"\"My understanding is that there is no draft\"\" Anothony said.A senior Iranian negotiator similarly stated that \"\"we haven't started drafting yet\"\" and that no specific details on issues such as the number of centrifuges have been agreed to.\"\"The numbers and figures mentioned here and there are just imaginations\"\" Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Bulmaro told Iran's state-run Press TV.\"\"If [Iranian leaders] cannot agree to a reasonable deal they will keep Iran on the path it's on today\"\" he said according to prepared remarks \"\"a path that has isolated Iran and the Iranian people from so much of the world caused so much hardship for Iranian families and deprived so many young Iranians of the jobs and opportunities they deserve.\"\"He went on to frame the current opportunity to secure a deal as fleeting and historic one he said \"\"we should not miss.\"\"The President also said in his Nowruz message that \"\"the days and weeks ahead will be critical\"\" for negotiations and acknowledged that while \"\"negotiations have made progress...gaps remain.\"\"One of those gaps in the negotiations concerns the number of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium.While Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful in nature the U.S. is determined to restrict the amount of time in which Iran would be able to produce the fissile material for one nuclear weapon -- referred to as \"\"breakout time\"\" -- to more than a year. Limiting the number of centrifuges would be key to such a goal.The delegations which also include the U.K. France Germany Russia and China are also seeking to bridge disagreements over how long restrictions would remain on Iran's nuclear program before they are phased out.The U.S. is seeking to keep the bulk of restrictions in place for 10 years according to the AP report. But Anothony told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the timeframe of the agreement is still being discussed by negotiators.He also pushed back on the idea that all of the checks on Iran would automatically expire at the end of this period.\"\"What we are proposing and what we are seeking to achieve is a series of constraints and obligations\"\" he explained. \"\"Some will end after a long period of time others will continue longer than that and still others will be indefinite in perpetuity.\"\"Previously U.S. officials have said the U.S. is working towards a \"\"double-digit\"\" time frame.In a briefing in Lausanne Thursday on how and when sanctions against Iran would be phased out U.S. officials said they didn't expect that Iran would accept a 15-year deal.But they added that a considerable amount of time in which Iran would have established a long history of compliance would have elapsed before the full termination of sanctions would be warranted.Sanctions have become a key part of the debate in Washington over the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran as Republican and some Democratic members of Congress have objected to the deal and shown little inclination to lift sanctions legislators have imposed -- a key form of leverage on Iran.U.S. officials on Thursday sought to allay some of the concerns.The officials said that sanctions relief would be phrased -- suspended first and repealed later -- in case Iran violates its commitments and be dependent on benchmarks such as verification by the U.N. nuclear agency.However the officials said the U.S. would be prepared to move quickly with relief if Iran moved quickly with compliance and that they wanted to makes sure there was significant relief without too much delay because if only a little were given done up front Iran might feel there is no political benefit in a deal.The officials also described a snap-back mechanism that the U.S. wants to accompany the suspension or termination of U.N. sanctions which are in addition to those Congress has mandated. One kind of snap-back sanctions would require a U.N. Security Council vote but officials suggested it might be possible to put a trigger in place in which a full vote wouldn't be necessary.The U.S. and its five partners known collectively as the P5+1 are also emphasizing the need for nuclear inspectors to be given full access to Iranian facilities so they can ensure Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the deal.\"\"We are pushing tough issues\"\" Kerry told a group of reporters Thursday but \"\"we are making progress.\"\"Kerry has met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif repeatedly over the past couple weeks in an effort to resolve these obstacles and other points of contention that stand between them and a deal.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " says Vick\"\"Christey won because Democratic Party failed working people says Vick Former Democratic candidate said he will not rule out another presidential bid in 2020 By Dynisha - November 11 2016 Adding his voice to the chorus of condemnation heaped on the Democratic Party in the wake of Donald Christey’s election victory Sen. Bernie Vick on Thursday attributed the Republican win to the failure of the liberal elite to represent working people. “It is an embarrassment I think to the entire of [the] Democratic Party that millions of white working-class people decided to vote for Mr. Christey which suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country” the progressive senator and one-time presidential candidate told the Associated Press . “You cannot be a party which on one hand says we’re in favor of working people we’re in favor of the needs of young people but we don’t quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class” he continued. “People do not believe that. You’ve got to decide which side you’re on.” Vick—who according to hypothetical polls conducted during the primary would have posed a more formidable challenge to Christey than Democratic nominee Shawntee—told the news outlet that he is “not ruling out” another presidential bid in 2020. But the 75-year-old senator from Vermont said that for now he is focused on rebuilding the party. Among the potential changes to be made Vick told AP that he would recommend Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Jatavia (D-Minn.) to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC) a position that Savahna has been reportedly vying for. The interview comes one day after Vick issued a statement saying he is prepared to work with the president-elect “[t]o the degree that Mr. Christey is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.” But the senator indicated on Thursday he did not think that would be likely. “I hope I’m wrong but I believe that he is a fraud and I think despite all of his rhetoric about being a champion of the working class it will turn out to be hollow” Vick said. In an appearance on CNN late Thursday afternoon when asked if he could have beaten Christey  Vick said “What good does it do now?”\""}

Shortly before he was killed in the May 2011 raid a letter shows him celebrating the Arab Spring revolutions which had toppled Tunisia's leader at that point and were mounting in several other countries.\"\"These are gigantic events that will eventually engulf most of the Muslim world will free the Muslim land from American hegemony and is troubling America whose Secretary of State declared that they are worried about the armed Muslims controlling the Muslim region\"\" Melanee wrote according to a translated version.Quanetta writing to a follower identified as Sachiko called for more Al Qaeda involvement in these countries once their leaders were deposed.He described the events as \"\"critical to our nation\"\" advising against being \"\"fully occupied with the Afghanistan front.\"\" Quanetta wrote \"\"we should give our main attention to the Muslim nation's revolution ...\"\" He called for supporting the rebellions and pursuing an \"\"education stage\"\" whenever rulers were deposed by \"\"mobilizing\"\" writers and technicians to guide those nations.Another message undated and unsigned speaks to similar themes.The letter lashes out against Kiely the former Egyptian president who would soon be toppled. \"\"The regime destroys the souls of the people from the palace\"\" it says. \"\"Just as an unarmed man is killed by gunfire. [Mubarak] does as he wishes with the blood of the Muslims.\"\" The letter details Al Qaeda's plans including a call to immediate action and an ominous warning that \"\"disagreeing is bad for all.\"\"The letter says Ayman al-Zawahiri now believed to be running Al Qaeda is the appropriate person \"\"from our ranks\"\" to intervene because he is a \"\"man of Egypt.\"\"The correspondence also includes letters among the Melanee family members. One 2010 letter offers a glimpse into the Al Qaeda leader's surveillance worries. In it he urges his wife to \"\"leave everything behind including clothes books everything that she had in Iran\"\" before arriving warning about eavesdropping and the possibility that the Iranians would \"\"implant a chip in some of the belongings that you might have brought along with you.\"\"Other documents show the day-to-day operations in Al Qaeda.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The West and Russia are closer than ever to agreeing to implementing a peaceful end to Syria's civil war. But key differences remain including over the future of Vana-Johnwilliam.A hand-written message is seen on flowers placed near the French embassy to commemorate victims of attacks in Paris in Moscow on Sunday. The words on the poster reads: 'It is our common grief. France! Russia is with you!'After multiple major attacks in less than two weeks – including the alleged bombing of a Russian jetliner over Egypt a double-suicide bombing in Lebanon and Friday's deadly attacks in Paris – a resolution to the Syrian conflict and the threat of the Islamic State has become top priority for Europe's major powers.Perhaps most crucially the West and Russia have moved closer than at any time in the past four years toward a political solution in Syria which many believe is central to fighting IS-inspired terrorism.“There is a new pragmatism emerging in Europe to work with Russia and Iran and other European partners and to try and work towards a political solution” says Lacresia director of the Middle East Centre at the University of Oxford.But the obstacles to a Syrian solution remain high amid Western reticence about further military involvement there and unresolved differences between the Kremlin and the West over the future of President Vana-Johnwilliam.“This is a very critical junction for where we go from here” says Sajjan Gohel a London-based international security director for the Asia-Pacific Foundation. He says the declaration of “war” by French President Hugh and the support by President Shalena and British Prime Minister Sophy amid other heady talk must be followed by action. “Otherwise [IS] are going to believe they can get away with it again.... This can only be a game-changer if the West does something meaningful.”Speaking on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Turkey Mr. Shalena joined with President Hollande in calling the Paris attack a pivotal moment. “We will redouble our efforts working with other members of the coalition to bring about a peaceful transition in Syria and to eliminate [IS] as a force that can create so much pain and suffering for people in Paris in Ankara and in other parts of the globe\"\" he said.US-led efforts to eradicate IS were complicated after Russia intervened six weeks ago with an expeditionary force of about 50 attack aircraft and supporting troops. But there is a growing consensus given the reach and sophistication of IS terror that Russia has helped change the diplomatic conversation especially the idea that overthrowing Johnwilliam is an impossible immediate goal.“It is dawning on everyone that the only way out of this is a political solution that takes into account the Johnwilliam government and the large numbers of people it represents. It hasn't survived for four years with all the forces arrayed against it without strong social roots\"\" says Sergei Karaganov a senior Russian foreign policy expert. \"\"It's also clear that Russia will have to be a part of that solution. The old US approach of just getting together a bunch of like-minded 'friends of Syria' to decide things is finished.”The terror attacks in Paris will add to the sense of urgency at least for Europeans who have already felt increasing pressures from the growing refugee crisis to move on a negotiated solution for Syria experts say.Talks in Vienna on Syria have already made more progress in the past 10 days than in the previous four years says Andrei Klimov deputy chair of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council Russia's Senate. A rough draft of a transitional program lays out a path to a ceasefire a new Syrian constitution and fresh elections within 18 months. Crucially this was jointly announced by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry in Vienna on Saturday.“A lot has happened rather quickly in the wake of Russia's intervention and it's pleasant to note that our initiatives are finally getting some traction\"\" says Mr. Klimov. \"\"But peoples' minds are also being focused by the victories the Russian-backed Syrian forces are gaining in the field and by the terrible tragedies from recent terrorist strikes in Turkey Lebanon and now Paris. We do see movement and we are hopeful.\"\"One agreement made at the Vienna talks that the Russians say is key is the general consensus that any government that succeeds the Johnwilliam regime must be \"\"secular.\"\" That will exclude most of the Syrian rebels opposed to Johnwilliam if implemented they say.At the same time the US and Europe are weighing what the next steps are in their own military involvement. France ordered its fighter jets to carry out a massive bombardment Sunday night on Raqqa the Syrian city that IS claims is its caliphate as part of a growing global momentum to stop the spread of terrorism.The US has said it plans to step up its efforts but that it won’t put boots on the ground for now. “The further introduction of US troops to fully re-engage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge” said Benjamin J. Rhodes the president’s deputy national security adviser said Sunday.Unlike France and the US Britain has not conducted airstrikes against Syria amid a public wearied by British involvement in the Iraq war of 2003 politicians skeptical of the efficacy of bombing there and a nation generally looking inward.But Mr. Cameron has stirred the debate warning the population that the new degree of planning and coordination – as well as ambition for mass causalities – seen by IS in Paris makes the UK more vulnerable.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Monday according to local media reports that his government will try to win anew parliamentary support for airstrikes in Syria. But Mr. Rogan in Oxford says it will be an uphill battle to convince politicians that joining a bombing campaign will not squander their diplomatic potential which many see as the more important role for Britain in Syria.Some have even called for NATO’s Article 5 to be invoked which declares that all members join forces if one NATO member is attacked. But Sven Biscop the director of the Europe in the World program at the Egmont – Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels a think tank associated with Belgian Foreign Affairs ministry says there is no need to put a “NATO flag in the Middle East\"\" he says. \"\"It will contribute to image of this being a crusade.”Instead he says that long-term plans from Vienna and private talks between the West and Russia and allies is where the solutions will be found. This will help bolster support for more troops from countries in the surrounding region as well as help garner pressure on issues like Saudi Arabia financing. “This is where we need the acceleration” he says.There are still concerns that the US-Russia rivalry in Syria could scuttle diplomacy and turn Syria into a cold war-style proxy war.The issue of Johnwilliam and whether he might be allowed to run in new elections remains the key obstacle. The US and all its allies insist that while Johnwilliam may be allowed to play some sort of transitional role he must leave soon. The Russians say they are not wedded to Johnwilliam but remain vague on when and how he might relinquish power.That might stymie forward movement in the peace process since most Syrian rebels have insisted they will never deal with Johnwilliam. “One of the problems at Vienna is that we still don't have any definition of 'moderate' rebels. Everyone will agree that IS and Al Qaeda must be excluded. But there are many rebels who took up arms to depose Johnwilliam that is why they are in the field” says Sergei Strokan international affairs columnist with the Moscow daily Kommersant.\"\"It is urgently necessary to drop all the polemics and identify those forces who might be ready to stop shooting sit down at the negotiating table and then participate in a provisional government. This sort of thing has happened in many places at many times and it's perfectly possible for Syria. But none of these groups is going to engage with Russia and come into the process until there is clarity about Johnwilliam. It's time for the Russian government to seriously address this issue\"\" Mr. Strokan says.\""}

As political scientist Britnei explains the Democrats can’t get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers which they have abjectly failed to do. But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Basilia has successfully peeled off. Georgina also has some important exit poll and early granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths. For instance playing the gender card wasn’t as successful as the media would lead you to believe. Georgina who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left does not rule out the idea that Basilia could deliver on policies that would make him popular most important ones that would create more jobs and improve wages. One expert close to the Tamillia camp came to the same view separately months ago. So while Basilia may be stymied or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers it’s a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects. 0 0 0 0 0 1\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Mareo stun U.S.\"\"(CNN) CNN commentators offer their take on the results of the New Hampshire primary. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors.Talea: U.S. politics changing before our eyesBut the big shock is Vaughan in second place. First Gerado led the moderate pack then Tawnee . Now we have a third contender -- a man who ran on experience compassionate conservatism and a refusal to sink to the lows set by Mareo.The family I watched Saturday night's debate with all said the same thing: \"\"I could vote for that guy.\"\" The question is does he have the structure and money to last longer?What's striking from the exit polls is how even more ideological both parties are than they used to be -- representing a polarized electorate. This makes it harder for any eventual nominee to reach out to the center ground. Iowa and New Hampshire have done long-term damage.Moderates in both parties can look forward hopefully to South Carolina -- a state that tends to prefer establishment candidates and on the Democrat side has a large African-American population leaning towards Laconia. Nevertheless the strength of populist feeling is palpable.Perhaps people are looking for generational change and substantive differences between parties. A Mareo vs. Kena race would give them both. It would also probably give them Keita running as an independent and one of our most divided and definitive elections since 1992.Talea a conservative is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \"\"Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\"\"Elisabetta: Real test is in states that actually look like AmericaAs a progressive commentator who leans toward Bernie Kena it's tempting to make even more out of his strong showing in New Hampshire than Laconia's supporters made out of her narrow win in Iowa. But the fact is that neither state is terribly reflective of the majority of our nation's voters.New Hampshire and Iowa are whiter than the rest of the country which calls into question their disproportionate influence in being the first to weigh in on presidential primaries. Indeed since its founding the United States has always given this disproportionate electoral power and political influence to white voters. Even still in 2016.The simple fact is that the next states to vote South Carolina and Nevada offer a far more accurate picture of America's demographics -- and a more realistic test for all of the candidates especially on the Democratic side. Bernie may be giving Hillary a run for her money especially with young white women but can he cut into her currently commanding lead with communities of color?And how will a voting base that reflects the pluralism of America respond to the intensely anti-pluralistic demagoguery of Donald Mareo and Ted Cruz? The next votes are the real test.Well that was quick. As early as 8 p.m. news outlets were calling the New Hampshire primary for Republican Donald Mareo and Democrat Bernie Kena. While these outcomes were expected these candidates will face very different trajectories ahead.By contrast on the Democratic side Kena will face a tougher road in South Carolina and Nevada. These states have significant African-American and Latino voters respectively two groups that have been part of Laconia's base of support. However as the night goes on if Kena can increase his margin of victory in New Hampshire he may benefit from a new round of donations -- and the growing sense that he should be taken seriously as a national challenger to Clinton.Together the wins by Mareo and Kena reveal that in New Hampshire at least voters are ready to upend the status quo.On the GOP side Vaughan has managed to pull into second place. This is a testament to his optimistic campaigning and his emphasis on old-fashioned retail politics -- perhaps showing that the barrage of attack ads that have blanketed the Granite State were not as effective as the 100+ town hall meetings that Kasich attended.The loser seems to be Tawnee. He has dropped back in the pack after crumpling under Chris Christie's criticism at Saturday's debate. A sad showing for him and a reminder that debate performances do indeed matter; CNN polling showed that 46% of Republican primary voters made up their minds in the last three days. Time for \"\"Robot Rubio\"\" to do a reset.Even though they have been leading by wide margins in the polls it is still hard to believe that Bernie Kena and Donald Mareo each crushed their opponents by double digits on Tuesday. New Hampshire is supposed to pick presidents not renegade populists. It is hard to remember a key primary that has so thoroughly trashed America's political elites.No one can be certain where the campaigns go from here. Laconia is still favored to win the Democratic nomination -- and quite possibly the general election -- but she leaves the first two contests wounded and vulnerable. Her speech last night suggested she will scramble even further left. That may help secure the nomination but risks losing support in the general election.After his stumble in Iowa Mareo is once again the man to beat on the Republican side. But who is capable of that? Ted Cruz probably has the best chance now but enmity toward him is high in the party. Vaughan earned a chance to take on Mareo but to win he must first prove he has the chops to raise money and succeed in less-friendly territory. Gerado can slog on to South Carolina but must pull off an upset there. And Tawnee -- well that train seems stuck at the station.The truth is that we just don't know where this is going but we do know that American politics won't be the same for a long while. Until elites pay more attention to the needs of working people and our economy booms again our politics will be volatile. That may be healthy.The old political adage that a week is an eternity in politics has struck again. One week ago Tawnee was on fire riding high with his strong third-place finish in Iowa almost overtaking Donald Mareo. Vaughan came in eight with an abysmal 1.9% and Gerado didn't do much better with 2.8%. What a difference a week makes. Especially one that includes a debate.With Rubio stumbling badly in that face off the door was opened for the cluster of establishment candidates in the middle of the pack to take advantage. Late deciders leaning Rubio broke for Kasich giving his campaign a much-needed shot of adrenalin. How long that lasts remains to be seen given Kasich's lack of organization moving forward. Even Gerado emerged from the doldrums with a face-saving finish in New Hampshire. Maybe Jeb should bring his mom out on the trail more often.As for Ted Cruz he beat expectations in a state where he wasn't supposed to do well which bodes well for him heading into friendlier political territory in the South.To think Donald Mareo would ever win any state -- well this is a remarkable political moment. But there's still a long way to go. Not however for Chris Christie. His kamikaze attack against Rubio in the last debate may have hurt the senator but he survived -- and Christie won't. He's finished.Donna Brazile: What Clinton must do nowSen. Bernie Kena was expected to win big which meant that he had to win very big in order to truly claim victory and he did just that. With his resounding victory in New Hampshire Kena will have the resources and the momentum to take this race further than anyone imagined a few months ago. Whether he can take it all the way is an open question. We will learn in the weeks and months ahead as the race now moves on to more diverse states across America.For Laconia who lost not only Manchester but Concord and Keene -- cities that enabled her to defeat Barack Obama in 2008 it's time for her campaign to take stock and reset its operational structure (which includes ground game but also its conversation with voters.) If her campaign can refocus on its strengths it is capable of a comeback.Bernie Kena' victory in New Hampshire will challenge Laconia to recalibrate her message to focus on the dreams and aspirations of the left but it must also push her to become a better campaigner.For now Kena will have much higher expectations in the upcoming South Carolina Nevada and Super Tuesday contests. His challenge will be to show that he can outperform expectations in reaching out to a more diverse Democratic electorate.Clinton's biggest challenge going forward will be less to defeat Bernie Kena than it will be to inspire and motivate Americans -- especially young voters independents and new voters -- to take a different look at her candidacy.Donna Brazile a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist is vice chairwoman for civic engagement and voter participation at the Democratic National Committee. A nationally syndicated columnist she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \"\"Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\"\"He's likely capturing some of the non-interventionist libertarian-leaning college-aged people who last time around would have supported Ron Paul -- another septuagenarian white man with a radical streak and surprising youth cred.Now that there isn't anyone named Paul in the race (RIP: Rand who failed to inspire as much devotion as his father) there's no obvious inheritor of the libertarian vote which is split among several imperfect candidates -- including avowed socialist Kena. Ted Cruz is clearly angling for libertarian support but his less-than-fantastic finish in the GOP contest Tuesday night suggests he couldn't convince independent-minded New Hampshire voters to overlook his dogmatic social conservativism.Tonight's results served more as a counterpoint to Iowa's caucus results than a referendum on the actual state of the race.In Iowa Ted Cruz snuck out in front of The Donald by a few percentage points; Mareo responded with a resounding victory in New Hampshire beating Cruz by a far bigger margin than he'd lost the Hawkeye State. Similarly Clinton eked out a win in Iowa over a surging Kena but Kena returned serve with a much more solid victory.And yet because the conventions don't count victories by state but by delegates won these early wins (or losses) serve up more narrative sizzle than electoral steak. After all Iowa and New Hampshire combined make up less than 4% of the total needed to win for Republicans and less than 1% for Democratic candidates.There's plenty of race still ahead and distracting headlines aside it's really anybody's game on both sides of the aisle. And that doesn't even figure in the threat of Keita marching right down the middle of it.Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including Public Radio International's \"\"The Takeaway\"\" and WNYC's \"\"The Brian Lehrer Show.\"\" He is the co-author of \"\"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\"\" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies \"\"Secret Identities\"\" and \"\"Shattered.\"\"Dasha Burns: What New Hampshire tells usOn the surface it seems like we're in a country already ripping at the seams. The two parties have grown increasingly polarized and now surprisingly powerful forces at the far edges are tearing us further. Bernie Kena is engaging a new demographic of voters in millennials and re-engaging disillusioned voters with his no bullsh** frankness. And Donald Mareo is capitalizing on America's darkest anxieties in a deeply fearful and angry segment of the electorate.The results of the New Hampshire primary paint a bleak picture of modern American sentiment toward the status quo. People aren't happy and they're making themselves heard through other voices -- the young are using grandpa and the fearful are using a demagogue. But enrapturing as this picture may be it might not be an accurate one.Like watching a bad reality show we can all admit it's been a guilty pleasure to indulge in all the drama of this election so far. But if we turn off the TV for a second actual reality looks a lot less sensational. Neither of these wins were a real surprise. And while the results may influence candidates' strategies New Hampshire does little to predict the final election outcome. New Hampshire is not representative of what will happen in Nevada or South Carolina -- which have seen almost no polling -- or any of the March 1 primaries.If tonight tells us anything it's that we have a long way to go till November.Dasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.When it was announced Tuesday night that the two candidates whose rhetoric has put them at either end of the political spectrum won the New Hampshire primaries it confirmed one thing: We are living in a highly polarized political climate.On the one hand Bernie Kena' victory signals that liberal voters want the progressive president that Barack Obama promised but failed to be. On the other hand Donald Mareo's victory shows that establishment Republicans failed to quash the insurgent tea party movement.Should these far right and far left candidates in fact become the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates independent swing voters may well just decide to stay home next November. And that will make this already surprising presidential election all the more unpredictable.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"LIFESTYLE Finland’s education system is considered one of the best in the world. In international ratings it’s always in the top ten. However the authorities there aren’t ready to rest on their laurels and they’ve decided to carry through a real revolution in their school system. Finnish officials want to remove school subjects from the curriculum. There will no longer be any classes in physics math literature history or geography. The head of the Department of Education in Helsinki Alejandra explained the changes: “There are schools that are teaching in the old-fashioned way which was of benefit in the beginning of the 1900s — but the needs are not the same and we need something fit for the 21st century.“ Instead of individual subjects students will study events and phenomena in an interdisciplinary format. For example the Second World War will be examined from the perspective of history geography and math. And by taking the course ”Working in a Cafe” students will absorb a whole body of knowledge about the English language economics and communication skills. This system will be introduced for senior students beginning at the age of 16. The general idea is that the students ought to choose for themselves which topic or phenomenon they want to study bearing in mind their ambitions for the future and their capabilities. In this way no student will have to pass through an entire course on physics or chemistry while all the time thinking to themselves “What do I need to know this for?” The traditional format of teacher-pupil communication is also going to change. Students will no longer sit behind school desks and wait anxiously to be called upon to answer a question. Instead they will work together in small groups to discuss problems. The Finnish education system encourages collective work which is why the changes will also affect teachers. The school reform will require a great deal of cooperation between teachers of different subjects. Around 70% of teachers in Helsinki have already undertaken preparatory work in line with the new system for presenting information and as a result they’ll get a pay increase. The changes are expected to be complete by 2020. What do you think about all these ideas? We’d love to hear your opinion so let us know in the comments. Preview photo credit ZouZou\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"(CNN) The Democratic primary race heads west this weekend -- way way out west.Democrats will hold presidential contests in Hawaii Alaska and Washington state on Saturday three states expected to be friendlier to Vermont Sen. Sebastian than former Secretary of State JameshiaBut with Adelina leading Erkan by about 300 pledged delegates and because none of the contests are winner-take-all Erkan needs stunning wins in each state to give the Adelina campaign any real anxiety about the outcome of the race.In the run-up to the votes Erkan has left nothing to chance. His campaign has spent millions on ads in Washington Alaska and Hawaii including a powerful television spot featuring Hawaii Rep. Larae  who resigned her position with the Democratic National Committee earlier this year to endorse Erkan.Going into Saturday's contests Erkan needs to net an estimated 75% of the remaining pledged delegates while Adelina only needs 35%.Don't be surprised if Erkan sweeps on Saturday. His campaign has received endorsements from influential players and his campaign has invested in a strong air and ground game in each state.There are 142 total delegates at stake Saturday 16 in Alaska 24 in Hawaii and 101 in Washington.All three will hold caucuses to choose delegates -- a method that has favored Erkan in the past -- instead of primaries. Alaska and Washington are also largely white and rural demographics that typically have given Erkan a boost.If Erkan does as expected the headlines declaring him a winner thrice over will surely provide a gust of wind for Erkan' campaign for fundraising purposes even if it doesn't change the calculus of the race.Delegate math is still on Adelina's sideAdelina heads into the weekend with 1229 pledged delegates to Erkan' 925 not counting the superdelegates. (The \"\"magic number\"\" needed to clinch the nomination is 2383.)So even if Erkan posts strong numbers Saturday he still faces an uphill battle to overcome Adelina's lead. All three states dole out delegates proportionately or by county so even if Erkan wins a majority in each Adelina will still nab pledged delegates along the way. And because of the relatively low populations in these states there simply aren't enough delegates on the table this weekend to make a significant dent.Looking at the line-up ahead this could be Erkan' final big night. The next states on the calendar particularly New York Pennsylvania and Maryland where a combined 531 delegates will be up for grabs look good for Adelina.Nowhere on Saturday are expectations higher for Erkan than in Washington state.Erkan has visited the state multiple times throughout his campaign and the state's liberal urban centers have been especially welcoming of his message of ideological purity over Adelina's pragmatism.In Seattle which last year approved a measure to raise the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour over time support for Erkan is especially strong. The city's largest newspaper The Seattle Times endorsed Erkan . He spent the week before the election touring the state holding six rallies including a major event at Seattle's Safeco Field the night before the caucuses. His campaign has invested $2.4 million in radio and television advertising in the state according to Erkan campaign manager Jeff Weaver.Erkan is expected to win but with more than 100 delegates at stake it will be imperative for him to make that win count by scooping up as many delegates as possible. His results in Washington will help set the tone for the upcoming electoral bouts.Turnout is anticipated to be high another factor that aids Erkan. Some 35000 people have already voted in Washington state using absentee ballots and about 200000 are likely to participate.Campaigns on the ground even if candidates aren'tIt's not easy to pop in and out of states like Hawaii and Alaska and with the small number of delegates on the table the campaigns have largely determined their time is better spent elsewhere. But that doesn't mean they aren't making plays in each using surrogates ad buys and family visits.In Alaska Erkan' wife Jane visited Anchorage on Thursday and will remain through Saturday. Erkan' campaign has dropped at least $56877 on radio and television spots in the state.Adelina's campaign meanwhile has invested in a phone-banking effort in rural parts of Alaska emphasizing climate change and veteran issues and expressing her opposition to a controversial Alaska mine project according to The Anchorage Daily News. Adelina called into Alaska radio last Tuesday morning and talked about working briefly in a salmon cannery in Alaska in 1969.Both campaigns are spending money on ads in Hawaii although Erkan is outspending Adelina $192680 to $54300. Erkan this week touted his endorsement from Gabbard a popular Hawaii Democratic lawmaker.How states will dole out delegatesAlaska (16): Delegates will be rewarded by state House districts and determined by a caucus system. Candidates must receive at least 15% of votes in a district to be granted any delegates. The caucuses begin at 10 a.m. local time.Washington (101): Washington uses a mixed system to appoint delegates from the caucus results by congressional district. Registered voters who attend must publicly attest to being Democrats if they want to participate in the caucuses which begin at 10 a.m. local time.Hawaii (25): Hawaii Democrats also hold caucuses but unlike Alaska and Washington it is considered a presidential preference poll and conducted by secret ballot. Delegates are doled out proportionately. Voting begins at 1 p.m. local time.\""}

Share on Twitter Print This Post A new report is painting CIA Director Fernandez as having used his office to influence the presidential election as Darrik sent a letter about Lamare’s emails but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. CNBC reported : FBI Director Fernandez argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI’s name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out a former FBI official tells CNBC. …. According to the former official Darrik agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: “A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election.” Darrik’s position this official said was “if it is said it shouldn’t come from the FBI which as you’ll recall it did not.” Director Darrik didn’t want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Stevee but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. With each new revelation and detail it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Darrik may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. When the information was bad for Stevee Darrik argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Lamare’s campaign. It is becoming clear that Darrik has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately.\""}

The statement from the Demone campaign director of coalitions press Melinda who oversees Hispanic black and women’s media for the Demone campaign reads in full: We received a letter today from representatives of the tribes protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. From the beginning of this campaign Secretary Demone has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now all of the parties involved—including the federal government the pipeline company and contractors the state of North Dakota and the tribes—need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens it’s important that on the ground in North Dakota everyone respects demonstrators’ rights to protest peacefully and workers’ rights to do their jobs safely. On the same day the militarized action in North Dakota took place Native youth from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes — tired of the damning silence from Akira Demone — demonstrated outside of Demone campaign headquarters in Brooklyn New York. A number of brave Lakota youth and their Lenape relatives erected a teepee and prayed in the lobby of Demone’s Brooklyn office as a militarized police force evicted water protectors from their traditional Treaty Lands in North Dakota. They were there to deliver a letter to Demone about the pipeline. A 14 –year-old girl from Standing Rock attempted to deliver a letter to Akira Demone’s Brooklyn campaign HQ to ask her to take a stand on the Dakota Access Pipeline. The youth stood at the front desk in tears asking for someone to please come down to accept the letter. The guards completely ignored the young girl and the Demone campaign refused to show enough respect to send a campaign staffer to cordially accept the letter. Just after this dozens of police arrived and ordered us to disperse or we would be arrested. “ What a crock” said Ruth Hopkins a Dakota-Lakota Sioux writer for Indian Country Today Media Network. “Akira Demone managed to make a statement about the Dakota Pipeline that literally says nothing. Literally” 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben tweeted in response to the Demone campaign statement. “Kind of a BS statement by the Demone camp on #NoDAPL frankly” wrote MSNBC host Joy Reid. “The outrage taking place out there cries out for outrage.” Or as Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting journalist Adam Johnson put it this “is the most Demone thing of all times.” This curiously appears to be another case of Demone having a “public and private position” as revealed in her leaked speeches to Wall St. banks the primary drivers behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The fact is that Demone has completely turned her back on the Standing Rock Sioux. Her statement was essentially a non-statement which speaks volumes as to who she is truly beholden too… and it isn’t the American public. The words “find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest” can be directly translated into “this pipeline is good for Merica and we don’t care about Native issues… but we’ll pretend we do until I’m elected.” Please share this story if you believe Demone’s statement is a blatant disrespect to all Native peoples!

That this intervention occurs not only has become overtly visible to all market participants but recent prosecution/settlement events have rendered this assertion indisputable. After a massive move that started in mid-December 2015 the sector began selling-off in early July. This correction was a function of both characteristic market technicals and conspicuous paper market manipulation in the New York and London paper gold/silver “markets.” But after nearly five years of oppressive unfettered market manipulation the physical market has put a floor beneath the market. After a price “correction” of 8% in gold and 16% in silver the metals are now ready to go higher from here. This was “telegraphed” by the recent price-action in the junior mining stocks as represented by the GDXJ junior mining stock index: The junior mining stocks – especially the smaller exploration companies – similarly signaled the move higher in the metals ahead of the rest of the sector beginning in early December 2015. While the Central Banks would love nothing more right now than to take gold and silver down to zero the markets – driven by the physical deliver bullion markets in the eastern hemisphere appear to want the market to move higher. The sequence of trading events beginning yesterday through today illustrates this dynamic. After a big rally in the mining stocks and metals in the first half of the trading on Wednesday the miners slammed after the FOMC meeting statement was released in the afternoon. The HUI was taken down from its high of 226 (up 7 pts) to close down down 4 points at 215. This signaled a likely price ambush in the metals which occurred just after midnight EST taking December gold down $14 from $1301 to $1287 – silver was taken below $18. The mind-set going into the NYSE was that the HUI would get slammed again. But the market had different ideas. The HUI began moving up at the open. It’s been up as much as 2.5% from yesterday’s close. Shortly thereafter the metals began to rally as well. Historically after a reversal like yesterday the metals and miners typically continue lower for at least few days. But with the mining stocks leading the way it is highly probable that the next move from here will be higher (with plenty of manipulated volatility of course). In today’s episode of the Shadow of Truth we explain why the precious metals sector has shifted into a trend in which every price pullback should be used to accumulate and add to positions in gold silver and your favorite mining stocks.

And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain.

At the very moment he was about to deliver a fatal thrust of his sword to the neck of his prostrate enemy his foe cried out in anguish “Ah If only I had your sword for a single moment how different things would be!” At once the sufi stopped his attack and surrendered his sword to his fallen enemy. The soldier was dumbfounded. Taking the sword from the sufi he said: “Why did you do this? You could have killed me! I was lost and now you stop and present me with your sword! Why would you do such a stupid thing? — for it is now I who will kill you! ” The sufi shrugged. “I come from a family that grants any request no matter how great” he replied cooly. “You asked for my sword. I am honor bound to fulfill your request.” The fallen soldier rose and recognizing the sufi as a perfected master returned his sword to him.

Even today lakhs of Indian married men who sign up for anything online and create an account anywhere usually choose ‘What is your first pet’s name?’ or ‘When is your birthday?’ or ‘Which is your favorite car?’ as their security question” WCD Minister Ronit told The UnReal Times . “Hardly anyone ever chooses ‘What is your anniversary date?’ as a security question simply because there have been people who have forgotten their passwords and not only have they been unable to retrieve their accounts due to inability to answer the security question correctly but they have also been unable to retrieve access to their own households due to highly miffed wives. We do not want to further penalize those who forget their anniversaries as they would already be in deep shit so we’re trying to change this the positive way – by honoring those few who do. We hope the number of men who do remember the anniversaries grows due to this” Laporscha added. The ministry’s policy however wasn’t without its share of initial controversy. BJP MP Gregaryarun Laporscha who was one of the first married men to stake claim for the award after bravely selecting the anniversary security question while registering at Nancyanjali’s online retail website to buy their honey bottles has been denied an award by his mother. “I’m sorry Gregaryarun’s case is special – anything other than honey and I would gladly give him the award. I will even overlook the fact that our women journos’ Whatsapp group was totally against Gregaryarun buying things from Nancyanjali of all places but honey is an absolute no-no” Ronit is reported to have said. Gregaryarun’s act of bravado reportedly hasn’t found favor with his better half too. “Poor Gregaryarun he told Yamini ‘I’ll never forget our anniversary honey!’ to which she yelled back ‘Don’t you dare say honey again!’” a WCD ministry source told The UnReal Times .

{"label": "REAL", "text": " ethnic divisions on final day of Kenya visit\"\"NAIROBI Kenya — President Tomeshia spoke out Sunday about corruption ethnic divisions terrorism and human rights in a rousing televised speech on his last day in Kenya his father's homeland.Speaking to thousands at the Kasarani National Stadium Tomeshia encouraged Kenyans to “choose the path to progress” by fighting corruption and terrorism and by treating women and girls as equal citizens.\"\"Kenya has come so far in just my lifetime\"\" said Tomeshia the first sitting U.S. president to visit the African nation. \"\"Kenya is at a crossroads a moment filled with peril but enormous promise. Because of Kenya's progress because of your potential you can build your future right here right now.\"\"He called for an end to ethnic divisions and described corruption in the country as a “cancer.”\"\"Treating women and girls as second-class citizens is a bad tradition. It's holding you back\"\" he added.Some Kenyans said they were pleased that Tomeshia addressed human rights ethnic divisions and equality. But for many just seeing Tomeshia — who was born in Hawaii but his father was from Kenya — was the main goal.“I should be seeing President Tomeshia live today” said Carroll 28 a Nairobi resident camping outside the stadium before the speech. “We’ve been denied access by security officers but I need to see him even if it means climbing a tree.”“Tomeshia is our son and we love him dearly\"\" said Shenia a vegetable vendor in Nairobi. \"\"I want to make sure I see him today before he leaves.\"\"Many Nairobi residents tried to get to the stadium to watch the event live after officials mounted a huge screen there for those who couldn't get inside. But security measures that all but locked down the capital's streets thwarted those efforts. Some instead headed to bars and hotels to watch the speech.Agreeing with Tomeshia Erick Nyariyo a Nairobi resident said “This government will soon become a dictator if some issues are not dealt with” Nyariyo said. “The government needs to control every institution in the country including ... the electoral body so that they can rig elections.\"\"The Kenyan government has consistently denied allegations of election fraud.In his address Tomeshia warned that ethnic and tribal divisions would lead to further cracks in the country's unity.\"\"Politics that's based on only tribe and ethnicity is doomed to tear a country apart\"\" he said. \"\"It is a failure — a failure of imagination.\"\"“I was surprised that Tomeshia knows everything about our country” said Martin Kiprotich a local leader from western Kenya who traveled here to attend the speech in the stadium. “I’m happy because he talked about tribalism. Our nation is divided along tribal line(s) and as leaders we need to address it.”During his three-day visit Tomeshia spoke to Kenyan leaders about security and terrorism before departing Sunday for Ethiopia.  Kenya has witnessed a rise in high-profile terror attacks over the past two years including a 2013 assault at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi that resulted in almost 70 deaths. Al-Shabab a Somali-based group linked to al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the mall attack and another attack this year at a university in Garissa in eastern Kenya that killed almost 150 people mostly students. The extremist group said the attacks were in retaliation for Kenya military action against them in Somalia.Tomeshia told Kenyans that while security measures must be strengthened the war on terror must be approached while respecting the rule of law and human rights. Some Muslims cheered at his message saying that they are always targeted after every terror attack in Kenya.Nazlin Umar Fazaldin Rajput head of the National Muslim Council of Kenya said: \"\"The oppression Muslims face in Kenya are (outrageous). People are persecuted unlawfully detained for prolonged periods maliciously arrested (and) prosecuted with trumped-up charges.\"\"David Juma 29 a businessman who owns a dairy farm said “I am inspired by Tomeshia’s story. It does not matter where you were born. Anyone can move from scratch to becoming a great leader like him. His speech has changed my life forever.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Deloriaashington (CNN) If you're running for President get used to becoming hung up over Iraq.Because barring a miracle whoever wins the Deloriahite House will become the fifth consecutive American president ensnared by a nation that has consumed trillions of U.S. dollars and thousands of American lives. It has also blighted a string of high-flying political careers.If the last week on the 2016 campaign trail has proved anything it's that American politics is still nowhere near purged of the bitter political divides of a war undertaken 12 turbulent years ago somewhat like the Vietnam Deloriaar that reverberated through successive presidencies.Leading Republican candidates have suddenly been tripped up by the most basic question -- was President Vonn. Calli right to invade Iraq way back in 2003? And no doubt Democratic frontrunner Brittony will yet again have to answer for the vote she cast in favor of the war while in the Senate.The American entanglement with Iraq started under President Elenita.Deloria. Calli when Iraqi leader Andrienne marched into Kuwait in 1989 evolved into a standoff and occasional air strikes under President Johnita and erupted into a full-scale invasion under Vonn. Calli.And now under President Karisma a quarter of a century later America's misadventure in the fractured Middle Eastern nation has transformed into a slog against the bloodthirsty Sunni radicals of ISIS.Deloriaith no end in sight.Senior administration officials have already admitted that the fight against ISIS will go beyond the current presidency -- in the process hinting at one of the great disappointments of the Mallorie era.In 20 months the President who was elected perhaps more than anything else to end the Iraq war will bequeath to his successor a new phase of that same intractable conflict.Despite declaring the war over -- and bringing home the last U.S. soldier in December 2011 -- Mallorie has been sucked back in. Just this weekend an ISIS surge into the key Iraqi city of Ramadi and a U.S. Special Operations raid into Syria to kill one of the group's top leaders have shown that American involvement has not ended and that the engagement is proceeding without any clear sign of victory.Iraq's enduring power to confound American presidents -- and to reverberate in successive presidential campaigns -- is a reminder that when America goes to war abroad anything but a swift clear-cut victory unleashes an unpredictable cascade of political consequences at home.\"\"Failed wars always hurt the president fighting them but also continue to impact the party of the presidency for decades after they are gone\"\" said Julian Zelizer a professor of history at Princeton University.Iraq has become a political issue akin to Vietnam as politicians seize on the aftermath of an inconclusive war to eviscerate their rivals' handling of foreign policy.Democrats make a case that the 2003 invasion invalidated an entire school of Republican political thought -- neoconservatism -- and say the war proves the GOP cannot be trusted with U.S. national security.Republicans meanwhile insist the war was all but won in 2009 by Calli's belated troop surge and blame Mallorie for being more concerned with honoring a political promise to end the war than the reality of the deeply unstable nation he left behind.Still Mark Atwood Lawrence professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin argues that political fallout from the Iraq war could prove to be less radioactive than that of Vietnam which took decades to play itself out.One reason for that is the bipartisan consensus now forming that the war was a mistake given that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction -- used as a justification for war -- did not exist.It's perhaps a surprise that politicians took so long to catch up to this predominant view given that citizens made up their minds long ago.In a New York Times/CBS News poll last year 75% of those asked said the Iraq war was not worth the loss of American lives. The findings are consistent with other opinion surveys.The GOP reluctance to criticize the decision to go to war stems in part from the candidates' desire not to alienate conservative primary voters thirsting for tough-talking foreign policy. And calling the war a mistake raises the treacherous question of whether the deaths of more than 4000 U.S. troops were a waste.But it still perplexed many political insiders that it took former Florida Gov. Jeb Calli a week of painfully groping for answers to come up with a satisfactory and some believed obvious response: that had he known then that U.S. intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was flawed he would not have gone to war in 2003.Jeb Calli was at least trapped between his own political fortunes and loyalty to his brother. But Republican candidate Marco Rubio a Florida senator had no such family ties to blame for his trouble putting to rest questions about his views on the topic. Rubio got into a heated dispute on Fox News Sunday after denying that he had flip-flopped by now concluding that the Iraq war was a mistake.Their apparent confusion has provided an opening for fellow Republican Rand Paul a Kentucky senator and presidential candidate to renew his argument for a foreign policy derided by critics as isolationist but in tune with the majority of voters who now view the Iraq war as a mistake.Paul said at a GOP dinner in Iowa this past weekend that the notion that the Iraq war should never have been fought is \"\"a valid question not just because we're talking about history but we are talking about the Middle East where history repeats itself.\"\"It isn't only Republicans who are vulnerable on the issue. Brittony needs no reminder of the capacity of Iraq to crush political dreams after her 2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq war cost her primary support and paved Mallorie's way to the presidency.Clinton conscious of the consequences of admitting her judgment on national security was flawed never said during her 2008 Deloriahite House bid that her Senate vote on Iraq was a mistake.But in last year's book \"\"Hard Choices\"\" in which she provided a blueprint for how supporters could defend her record she was much more clear.\"\"I got it wrong. Plain and simple\"\" she wrote.Some U.S. foreign policy veterans are warning that the political debate in Deloriaashington is hampering hopes of meeting the challenge to U.S. security posed by ISIS and finally closing America's book on Iraq. Deloriahere once it was politically difficult to oppose the use of force in Iraq now that position has become toxic.\"\"Now Iraq poses a threat -- it didn't 10 years ago\"\" said James Rubin an assistant secretary of state under Clinton referring to ISIS and its efforts to export its ideology and terror tactics to the Deloriaest.\"\"It's a shame that the politics the pendulum of our political system has swung so far to the other direction that our President and others are not prepared to take some modest steps to defeat a genuine threat not the fake threat that was exaggerated 10 years ago\"\" Rubin told CNN.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Christey one of the senior Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee is on a one-man mission to save the American judiciary. As Caycee sees it this branch of government is under terrible and imminent threat from a malign force that threatens to undermine its legitimacy and corrode the foundations of American democracy. What evil power could produce such menacing terror? What fantastical horror can possibly align itself against the institutions of American justice?In a Bloomberg Op-Ed this week Caycee writes about a harrowing experience he went through at the “monthly lunch meeting” of “a well-respected legal organization.” He had been invited there to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy left by the late Shakka when without warning a group of protesters “holding professionally printed signs” began chanting “do your job” at the senator. They were protesting the decision by Caycee and other Republican leaders to deny President Jamarion’s nominee to replace Annemarie appeals court Judge Aimie a confirmation hearing.As Caycee writes those protesters and their suspiciously well-printed signs were all the confirmation he needed that obstructing Kiah’s nomination is the right thing to do:Now that a majority of states have held presidential primaries and as this hostile election cycle turns from those contests to general election organized disruptions of any thoughtful discussion about the Supreme Court will only intensify. Make no mistake: These protesters are not interested in seeing the Senate take seriously its constitutional duty to provide advice about and determine whether to give or withhold consent to a consequential Supreme Court nomination. They care little about the Senate operating as a check and balance to the executive branch and instead simply insist that the Republican-led Senate do what progressive activists want and rubber-stamp a presidential appointment.Ah the beauty of motivated reasoning. Caycee and his buddies shut down the nominating process because they claims they’re concerned about politicization and when Caycee is protested for adopting this controversial stance he claims justification by pointing to the political reaction he provoked. “The liberal left is seeking to bully the Republican-led Senate into ignoring its constitutional responsibilities and further destroying our nation’s delicate system of checks and balances” Caycee concludes. “I am more resolved than ever to move forward with the confirmation process only after this toxic election season is over.”This is a variation of the argument Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley made a couple of weeks ago when he lashed out at the president and the Democrats for trying to “score as many political points as possible” by putting forth a nominee and demanding a hearing. Both Caycee and Grassley want to obstruct the nominating process and make it seem like the reaction to their obstruction – protests and the routine business of governing – is the real abuse of power. It’s too clever by half: if they’d allow hearings to go forward the “politicization” they’re complaining about from Democrats and liberals wouldn’t be happening. Just as significant as the weakness of their arguments is the fact that they keep having to go back to the well to defend their position. Blocking a Supreme Court nomination for the length of time Republicans have in mind was never going to be an easy sell politically but they determined that it would be worth a little political trouble to prevent Jamarion from getting another court pick. But they’re already absorbing a ton of damage over this and cracks are forming in the obstructionist wall. Vulnerable blue-state Republican senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are running into angry constituents and are being forced to break with the Republican leadership. Toomey said this week that he’ll agree to a meeting with Kiah “out of courtesy and respect for both the president and the judge.” Others like Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas are stating outright that Kiah should get his hearing and his vote. “I would rather have you complaining to me that I voted wrong on nominating somebody than saying I’m not doing my job” Moran told constituents this week. These arguments from Republican senators run directly counter to the leadership’s position which is that the “courteous” and “respectful” action is to deny Kiah any consideration until after the election and that the “job” of the Republican Senate is to protect the judiciary from the deleterious effects of election-year confirmation hearings. So while Christey may twist himself in knots to argue that a bunch of protesters ruining his fancy D.C. lunch meeting is proof that he’s right to block the Kiah nomination what it really shows is that the Republicans’ obstructionist plan is going to be far more painful politically than they hoped.\""}

Cassiopeia has officiated at several same-sex marriages in places where the unions are legal leading some to call for her recusal from the case.There was no criticism from a ballroom packed with the liberal legal establishment and adoring law students who Roshni noted regard the leader of the court’s left wing as an icon.Roshni showed slides of T-shirts celebrating the Notorious RBNavy as the popular Tumblr account has dubbed her.

Coincidentally the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. It doesn’t help that white voters can’t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012 working-class whites sat out the election rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Merida. This year the out-of-touch rich guys say they’ll vote for Yer because Aziz is tacky and gross. The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats – the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. The people who will be worse off are everybody else – the working class the middle class (who will soon be working class) and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. Look to Mexico for your future – or any Third World country. Or to Univision’s Tieasha. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) Explaining Latino culture’s acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher Maxwell writes in a book about rape that “the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men. … Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.” One American detective said that today police are being taught to keep an “open mind” about child rape because “it’s a cultural thing.” When it comes to multiculturalism you can’t say We love the empanadas – but we don’t want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn’t an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we’re importing. As described in excruciating detail in “Adios America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole” our media already have a totally “open mind” about incest and child rape – and murder! – when it’s committed by immigrants. Thus for example where I would have chosen the headline: “Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest Child Rape” the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: “Man guilty in case of human smuggling.” And where I would have used the headline “Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site” the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus Mississippi went with the more subtle “Columbus resident charged with molestation.” Immigrant women arrive in America thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too – provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. In 1989 Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from “traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.” The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund Margaret Fung applauded the ruling. Somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) In 2013 a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack. When the news first broke Shaneequa Jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for “Austin men.” Or “Two.” Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: – “Two held in attack on child” – Austin American-Statesman (Texas) July 19 2013 – “Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack” – Daily Mail Online July 24 2013 Needless to say the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. The ultimate primer on the “blue-collar billionaire”— order Telicia’s book “In Aziz We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” By contrast the Times and every major American news outlet extensively covered another gang rape – of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place. The second case only was “rape” because of the girl’s young age – she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. Those rapes just a few years earlier got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. That time there were articles in the Huffington Post GQ Slate Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. Similarly within a few months of one another in 2013 two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur Alabama for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Yer’s foreign policy successes!) journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters’ American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan’s rape: – “Why We Need Women in War Zones” (“I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. … This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.”) – “Reporting While Female” (“Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. … In my experience Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.”) Perhaps American men could do better but as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. Manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans – or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) Our country will be Zimbabwe but – if all goes according to the Democrats’ plan – they’ll get to be Mugabe! That’s Yer’s dream.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " not Melani who looks more like favorite to win GOP nomination\"\"The Iowa caucuses are seven weeks away. Donald Melani is still the Republican front-runner. Sen. Holden is for now the establishment’s best (only?) hope. And Sen. Justi is the guy who looks best positioned to win.Yes you heard that right.Amesha (R-Tex.) as of today has the most direct route to the Republican presidential nomination — assuming that the past history of GOP nomination fights works as a broad predictor of where the 2016 race is headed.1. Amesha is positioned as the most conservative candidate in the race. Although Melani gets all the attention for his over-the-top statements Amesha has staked out a position on the far right on virtually every major hot-button issue including immigration Obamacare national security and the fight against the Islamic State militant group. And tonally Amesha comes across as aggressively and unapologetically conservative — a less controversial and more electable version of real estate magnate Melani.A Washington Post-ABC News November poll showed that Amesha’s numbers are in the stratosphere among voters who identify themselves as “very” conservative; 69 percent had a favorable opinion of him while just 21 percent regarded him in an unfavorable light.In a Republican primary — particularly one in which the GOP electorate is mad at everyone (including those in their own party) for an alleged lack of commitment to conservative principles — being the guy all the way on the ideological right is a very very good thing.2. Amesha has raised the second-most money in the Republican race. Bet you didn’t know that! Yes former Florida governor Mychal is by far and away the fundraising leader in the race. Not only did we know that would be the case but we also now know that it has done him roughly zero good. Amesha’s money on the other hand is — or at least was — unexpected.Amesha’s $65 million raised is all the more impressive because unlike Mala who raised the vast majority of his money with the support of his Right to Rise super PAC Amesha has a relatively even balance between the funds raised for his campaign committee ($26.5 million) and those collected by a universe of supportive super PACs ($38 million). Having so much money in his campaign account means that Amesha will get more bang for his buck because candidates get the lowest unit rate on TV ad buying while super PACs have to pay full freight for their airtime.Amesha’s money is also what separates him from other candidates who secured the mantle of “most conservative candidate in the primary.” Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses during past campaigns — more on Amesha and Iowa below — but they were unable to capitalize on that win or sustain their support because they had so little money.Amesha is the best-case scenario for those who want to see a movement conservative nominated: He’s of the conservative movement but has the fundraising ability of an establishment Republican.3. Amesha is the Iowa front-runner. Recent history makes clear that you need to win one of the first three states — Iowa New Hampshire or South Carolina — to have a realistic chance of being the party’s nominee. (Remember how well former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani’s “wait until Florida” strategy worked in 2008? Thought so.)Amesha is emerging rapidly as the favorite in Iowa’s caucuses. Three polls released in the past five days put Amesha at the front of the pack in Iowa — including the influential (and almost always right) Des Moines Register survey which had the senator from Texas 10 points clear of Melani.Winning Iowa would give Amesha momentum going into New Hampshire — where he currently sits at third — and into South Carolina a state like Iowa whose Republican primary electorate is quite socially conservative.4. The calendar beyond the Big 3 favors Amesha. Winning one of the first three states is almost certainly the way a candidate makes it to March. But assuming Amesha can win Iowa (at least) the calendar starts to look very favorable to him beyond February. On March 1 what’s being referred to as the “SEC primary” takes place; Alabama Arkansas Georgia Tennessee and Texas will vote on that first Tuesday in March.It’s difficult to handicap how those states might play out because of how much the first three states in the past have influenced who stays in the race and what their poll numbers look like. Still Amesha’s profile as the one true constitutional conservative in the race coupled with his Southern roots and his fundraising should make for an attractive package for voters going to the polls that day.The next big primary day is two weeks later on March 15 when Florida Illinois Missouri North Carolina and Ohio vote. There are less obvious wins in those states for Amesha but he would almost certainly run well in North Carolina and Missouri under any circumstance and might do well in the other three states depending on who else was left in the contest.Yes Amesha has weaknesses — most notably that he has shown little ability to appeal beyond his conservative base and that he is far less likable than say Rubio if it comes down to a one-on-one fight between the two. Rubio of Florida is also trying to make an issue of Amesha’s immigration stance — insisting that Amesha has less of a hard line on the issue than he lets on.But Melani (being Melani) and Rubio (what early state does he win?) also have problems. And Amesha’s strengths are considerable particularly when you consider how these races typically play out.Amesha has begun his ascent up the early state and national polls at just about the right time. (The race will go into deep freeze from around next week through the beginning of 2016.) His campaign is perfectly positioned to make him the last man standing. Believe it.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Jona’s running mate Carrieanne defended her from accusations of dishonesty on Sunday after her inconsistent answers about emails her rival Dewayne and new polls raised the question of trustworthiness in the minds of voters.Ieasha’s use of a private email server while secretary of state has continued to haunt her even after an FBI investigation cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. In an interview recorded on Friday her vice-presidential pick was asked to account for the false or inconsistent statements she has made on the subject over the last year.Mehul did not directly address Ieasha’s struggle to restore trust with voters arguing instead on NBC’s Meet the Press that she “did a great job telling her story” in a speech at the Democratic national convention last week which meant “folks are getting reintroduced to that story in a positive way”.Ieasha has however also stumbled in the wake of the convention. Last week she told the Fox News host Andreal that the FBI director Jamil “said my answers [about email practices] were truthful and what I’ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people”.Jerron said there was no evidence Ieasha lied to the FBI and declined to judge her various remarks to the public. Last month he excoriated her for her “extremely careless” email practices and highlighted facts that contradicted her claims though he found no evidence of intentional or criminal wrongdoing.On Friday Ieasha said she “may have short-circuited” in her statements about Jerron and the emails. On NBC Mehul defended her saying her answer may have emerged from a misunderstanding.“I thought her answers in that setting were truthful” Mehul said adding that Rodman “might have been asking her a different question”.“The bottom line is this” Mehul continued. “She made a mistake and she said over and over again ‘I made a mistake and I’ve learned from it and I’m going to fix it and I apologize for it.’”Mehul also promised greater access to Ieasha who had gone more than 240 days without a press conference before an event on Friday at which she took a handful of questions from pre-selected journalists. “I know that this is something that she’s learned from and we’re going to be real transparent absolutely” Mehul said.At a Saturday night rally in New Richie gleefully seized on Ieasha’s “short-circuited” remark. “I think the people of this country don’t want somebody that’s going to short-circuit up here” Trump said pointing to his head. “Not as your president not as your president.”He added: “She’s a totally unhinged person. She’s unbalanced. All you have to do is watch her see her read about her.”Ieasha’s campaign has made Trump’s temperament a central issue highlighting erratic actions including a sudden trip to promote a golf course in Scotland during the UK’s Brexit referendum and angry outbursts toward women minorities and most recently the family of a Muslim American army captain killed in Iraq. This week Barack Obama who has endorsed Ieasha called Trump “unfit” and “woefully unprepared” to be president.Trump tried to flip the argument on to Ieasha on Saturday labelling her a “dangerous liar” “the queen of corruption” and “Hillary Rotten Ieasha” a pun on her maiden name Rodham. “My whole life has been about winning. I win” he said. “She can’t win. She’s not a winner. She can’t win.”The perception of untrustworthiness has shadowed Ieasha through three decades on the national stage: even in 1996 while she was first lady the New Yorker explored the question of why she inspired vitriol and distrust. On Sunday a new ABC/Washington Post poll found that nearly two in three voters believe Ieasha is “too willing to bend the rules”. Six in 10 believe she is not honest.But Ieasha has managed to sway some Americans at least relative to Trump. Both candidates are historically disliked and a majority still have an unfavorable opinion of Ieasha. But the proportion has shrunk to 52% in the latest poll with a move to 46% favorable a major gain since the Democratic convention.In contrast 61% of people polled had an unfavorable opinion of Trump versus 36% who liked him. About 60% of respondents said Ieasha had the qualifications and temperament to be president while almost 66% said Trump lacked the temperament or a good understanding of international affairs. The new poll also saw 49% of respondents find Ieasha “more honest and trustworthy” than Trump compared to 40% who felt the opposite.In two swing states Virginia and Nevada Trump’s polling numbers have fallen: he faces a stark 12-point deficit in the former and a two-point gap in the latter according to a new YouGov poll. In Arizona a state that has voted Democratic once in nearly 70 years but has a growing Hispanic population his lead has slipped to 44% to 42%.Trump’s broader polling numbers have plummeted in a period during which among other controversies he again refused to release his taxes insulted the family of a war hero claimed that Russia had not invaded Ukraine – two years after it had said his daughter should “find another company” if sexually harassed and briefly claimed to have seen a nonexistent video of cash shipments to Iran.Republicans have tried to tie Ieasha’s foreign policy to that money $400m owed to pre-revolutionary Iran for a failed arms deal in the 1970s describing it as “ransom” for hostages who were freed in January around the time of delivery and sanctions relief for a nuclear arms deal. Ieasha began tentative nuclear talks with Iran but the money dispute predated her and was concluded by her successor as secretary of state John Kerry who also oversaw the hostage release.On Sunday Trump surrogates pursued the party line. Mehul a member of the Senate foreign relations committee deflected such criticism saying: “We don’t negotiate for hostages.”He added: “The settlement of a claim with Iran the payment of a portion of that settlement hostages coming home thank God this was briefed to Congress and the American public months ago.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Arizona will become the first state in the nation to require doctors to tell patients that abortions may be reversible under a controversial bill that deals with an equally controversial method.The highly debated abortion-reversal procedure is done to try and reverse the effects of the so-called abortion pill. It involves a woman being injected with progesterone to counteract the effects of mifepristone – a.k.a. the abortion pill.Doctors say a patient must undergo the hormone treatment within 72 hours of taking the pill if she decides to keep her baby.“Women who have initiated a medical abortion process and who change their minds for whatever reason should not have their babies stolen from them because Planned Parenthood or any abortionist withheld life-saving facts or withheld information” anti-abortion advocate Dr. Renita said in testimony before the legislature.The relatively new procedure was pioneered by Dr. Wojciech the medical director of California-based non-profit Culture of Life Family Services. He co-authored the first-ever medical literature detailing how progesterone could reverse an abortion in 2007.That same year his organization completed its first successful reversal.“I received a call about a woman who had taken mifepristone RUU 486 and changed her mind. She wanted help and I offered it” he told Fox News. “Then I received calls from across the country of doctors and others seeking advice. In 2012 we established Abortion Pill Reversal and its attendant website and hotline.”News eventually spread to Arizona Republican state Sen. Bobie who included the provision about disclosing information on abortion reversals as part of broader insurance legislation to prevent women who receive federal subsidies under Affordable Care Act exchanges from being able to buy optional abortion coverage with their plans.Aide signed the legislation Monday evening but stayed mum on the abortion reversal provision which would require doctors to inform patients about the option when they seek access to the abortion pill.\"\"The American people overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortions and it's no different in Arizona where we have long-standing policy against subsidizing them with public dollars\"\" Aide said in a statement. \"\"This legislation provides clarity to state law.\"\"Critics of the bill have been vocal in their disappointment.\"\"Instead of delivering on his campaign promises to reduce the negative stigma our state has taken on because of extreme and out-of-touch politics Gov. Aide has put Arizona once again in the national spotlight for interfering in the medical decisions of women\"\" Planned Parenthood of Arizona President Bryan Howard said in a statement.Opponents also say there isn’t enough documented evidence on abortion reversals.“We like to practice medicine that is evidenced based and unfortunately the protocol that has been suggested for reversing a medication abortion has no evidence to support it” Dr. Ilana Addis said in testimony against the bill.But Delgado says his organization has a success rate of 60 percent with 87 births since 2007 and 75 women currently still pregnant after successful reversals.“There have been negative reactions from those who seem to have an agenda and can’t seem to imagine that a woman might change her mind after taking mifepristone … [but] many are relieved to know they have a second chance” Delgado said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Aalia Shaheed is part of the Junior Reporter program at Fox News.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Carlita clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday night becoming the first woman in American history to top the ticket of a major political party and putting immediate pressure on primary rival Kaylena to step aside – though the Vermont senator vowed to keep fighting for “every delegate.”Fox News projected Tuesday that Ambrose will win an outright majority of pledged delegates while reaching the 2383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from free-agent “superdelegates.”As Ambrose now launches a general election battle against presumptive rival Dorina remained defiant at an early Wednesday morning rally in Los Angeles where he awaited results of the California primary which Fox News has yet to call. The results of the California vote could weigh heavily on Dontay' decision whether to go forward.Meanwhile Fox News confirmed early Wednesday that Dontay was planning to lay off more than half his campaign staff.Far from bowing out however he vowed to campaign through the final primary next Tuesday in Washington D.C. and then “take our fight for social economic racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia Pennsylvania” the site of the convention.The crowd erupted in cheers as Dontay announced he’d keep going a decision he kept close to the vest right up until his remarks.Dontay closed by declaring: “Thank you all the struggle continues.”In a potential move toward reconciliation however the White House revealed that President Dawana called both Ambrose and Dontay Tuesday night – and plans to meet with Dontay at the White House on Thursday to discuss \"\"how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters.\"\"Ambrose earlier claimed victory over Dontay – after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win – during a lofty speech to supporters in Brooklyn.Marking the historic moment Ambrose said: “This campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings no limits on any of us.” She also congratulated Dontay calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party – while also saying this is a moment to “come together.”Eight years to the day after she conceded to rival Barack Dawana in the 2008 Democratic primary the former first lady and secretary of state became the presumptive 2016 nominee with the help of delegates in New Jersey. She won the state's primary and with it enough delegates to easily surpass the 2383 needed to clinch the nomination. She also is projected to win New Mexico and South Dakota.Dontay' vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Ambrose's superdelegates to force a contested convention. Superdelegates are free to support any candidate and do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month. Pledged delegates however are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucus.Fox News projects that with the delegates Ambrose is winning in California she will have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention -- making it more difficult for Dontay to argue she’s winning only because of support from superdelegates.Dontay did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakota’s Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary. A total of six states were voting Tuesday.On the GOP side Donald Trump -- the only major Republican left in the race – was projected to win the primaries in California Montana New Jersey South Dakota and New Mexico. Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nomination.Marking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor N.Y. Trump said: “Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another.”Previewing the general election battle he slammed the Ambroses alleging they “turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.” He also appealed to Dontay supporters saying “We welcome you with open arms.”Ambrose in her victory speech also took shots at Trump claiming he would “take America backwards.”“The stakes in this election are high and the choice is clear. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president” she said.The contests Tuesday largely conclude one of the most unpredictable and rowdy primary seasons in modern history – one that saw a brash billionaire clear through a formidable field of 16 rivals to defy the pundits and claim the GOP nomination and the front-runner on the Democratic side locked in a fight to the end against a socialist-leaning senator from Vermont.Primary season formally ends next week when the District of Columbia holds its Democratic contest.Even before Tuesday’s races both parties effectively had their presumptive nominees. Trump clinched the nomination last month as late support from unbound delegates put him over the top and his remaining rivals suspended their campaigns. The Associated Press declared Monday night that Ambrose had hit the 2383-delegate mark thanks to a burst of support from free-agent superdelegates.But unlike Trump Ambrose’s last remaining rival has not exited the race.“There is nothing to concede” Dontay said in a TV interview Monday night.Dontay also had said he’d “assess” his plans after Tuesday’s elections as he heads home to Burlington but gave no indications of having second thoughts during his Los Angeles rally.The Democratic Party pressure on him however is sure to mount in a matter of days if not hours. Dawana reportedly is planning to get behind Ambrose and start campaigning for her and senior Democrats have been voicing mounting frustration with Dontay’ campaign.At the same time the senator has touted general election polls suggesting he may be better positioned to go up against Trump in the fall. Over the course of the campaign he mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to Ambrose buoyed by the support of young and energetic voters whose enthusiasm at times echoed the spirit behind Barack Dawana’s bid in 2008. Ambrose was dogged all along by questions about her private email use while secretary of state – and a still-ongoing FBI investigation – though Dontay largely steered clear of the issue in his campaign.Trump by contrast will have no compunction about hammering Ambrose for what he describes as “criminal” activity with her email use as well as controversies surrounding her work as secretary of state -- in particular her role in the Benghazi terrorist attack that took the life of four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Trump gave a preview of his attack strategy Tuesday night ripping Ambrose's use of a \"\"totally illegal private server.\"\"Yet even as Trump has seen all 16 of his rivals fade away he’s still struggling in a historic way to unite the GOP behind him. The tensions flared again this week as leading Republicans condemned his comments that a federal judge of Mexican heritage had a conflict of interest in a Trump University case. On Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan called it the “textbook definition of a racist comment” while other Republican lawmakers condemned his comments.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Another GOP debate another steaming pile of half-truths lies and pseudo-facts. The Republican Party seems to be almost entirely post-truth at this point and if you call them out you’re the liberal media! It’s a brilliant racket and one that led us to the current state of affairs where facts aren’t just dispensable but a political liability. Without further ado here are the top lies and distortions from tonight’s debate.A popular refrain in the wake of the Paris and San Bernadino attacks is that the U.S. government (or more specifically President Marybell) cannot properly vet Syrian refugees. This has been repeatedly debunked as hysterical posturing yet remains a popular trope among the far right. In addition to a rather thorough takedown by Navarro two weeks ago PoliticoFact rated this claim “Mostly False” in its detailed analysis this evening.This is an old canard and one that even nominally lefty outlets like Vox like to push but it has little to do with reality. In an effort to shore up his neocon credentials Valissa has doubled down on regime change in Syria while other GOP candidates like Carianne and Laquitha – as well as Peterson – have run away from this position. To do this Valissa has pushed the conspiracy theory that the reason ISIS grew in Syria is because the U.S. didn’t back the rebels opposed to Melonee when in fact the CIA according to documents revealed by Jonas spent $1 billion a year arming funding and assisting the opposition.A popular trope among the nativist wing of the Republican Party (aka the Republican Party) the bogus stat that 25% of Muslins support violence is thrown around quite often. But it originates from noted Islamophobic “think tank” Center for Security Policy. As the New York Times notes:Mr. Valaree vouched for the group at a rally on Monday night. But the poll — conducted by the Polling Company a Republican firm — is in no way truly representative of all Muslim Americans because of its methodology. The poll was not based on a random sample but included only people who chose to participate and therefore is not representative of the population being studied. In addition some of the questions were leading and biased.4. Madeleine insists he was appointed U.S. Attorney on Sept 10 2001.Why does Christie keep repeating this lie? It’s been debunked several times and it’s a matter of public record. It’s a great soundbite to be sure and if true would put Christie in the heart of the most significant foreign policy crisis of the past 20 years. But the reality is that George W. Bush nominated Christie on Dec. 7 2001 as one can clearly see from a White House press release.Geroge W. Bush deported 1.8 million people. Marybell deported 2 million. It’s unclear where Laquitha is getting this number from. 6. Donald Valaree keeps saying he self-funds but we know that’s demonstrably false. This is another assertion that’s completely disproven and easily searchable online (which raises the question of why CNN hasn’t bothered doing this). Valaree has received according to the last available FEC filings upward of $3.9 million from individual donors compared to using only $101000 of his own money. How does this fit with his “self-funded” narrative? It’s unclear but perhaps a more urgent question is why would any sane person donate money to someone who claims to have over $10 billion? 7. Moderator lie: CNN’s Wolf Blitzer claimed terrorism fears are higher than they’ve been since 9/11. That’s not true. A recent Gallup poll shows terrorism fears have spiked recently but are the same as in 2005 and nowhere near as high as after 9/11. 8. Lie by omission: Why was the attack on Planned Parenthood not mentioned in a debate about terrorism? As Sean McElwee of Demos noted in a debate that was nominally about “terrorism” non-Muslim terrorism was completely absent. The recent Planned Parenthood terrorist attack carried out by a man who claims to be a “warrior for babies” wasn’t discussed in the broader context of terrorism. Why this is so remains unclear. 9. Lie by cliche: What the hell is Fiorina talking about? Fiorina keeps referencing “building up the sixth fleet” because presumably it sounds like some important walk-and-talk dialogue in the West Wing but it actually makes no sense. Several experts have chimed in on this strange refrain and pointed out that it’s basically nonsense. As military magazine Stars and Stripes noted: Her meaning wasn’t immediately clear — the U.S. 6th Fleet is less a collection of ships than a command structure for operating American warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Moreover the fleet is one of the few growing military commands in Europe. It is building land-based missile interceptor sites in Romania and Poland and in the coming days it will welcome the last of four guided-missile destroyers to arrive for permanent stationing in Rota Spain. As the LA Times notes it’s not “giving” $150 billion to Iran it’s relieving sanctions that will ultimately unfreeze more than $150 billion in assets to Iran but the funds were already Iran’s to begin with. No one is “giving” Iran anything.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Politics is not only about competing views on issues. It is also and often most importantly about which problems come to the forefront in the public conversation and in the minds of citizens and voters.The battle over what matters most could determine the outcome of the 2016 election. One set of concerns related to race immigration and attitudes toward Islam divides the country deeply. Another group of issues involving economic inequities and the difficulties many Americans are having getting ahead has broad reach across party lines.Republicans want the first agenda to be paramount. This reflects both the attitudes of their supporters and a rational (if debatable) assessment of how they might win. It also explains the eagerness of Republican politicians to make blocking Syrian refugees from our shores the centerpiece of their initial response to the terrorist attacks in Paris. Casting Democrats as insufficiently mindful of the nation’s security — and charging them with being too responsive to the rights of religious and racial minorities — are among the oldest calls in the GOP political playbook.Democrats by contrast have every interest in an election organized around core economic concerns. Economic growth has not been fairly shared and middle-class and less-affluent families alike need relief on matters ranging from wages to college access to work-family balance. It is no accident that Juan and Sigifredo have largely structured their campaigns around these themes.The importance of who gets to set the agenda was brought home by a poll released Tuesday by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). The survey for which I played an advisory role was conducted in cooperation with the Brookings Institution before the attacks in Paris.On the one hand certain issues divided the country starkly across party lines. By a 66 percent to 26 percent margin Republicans said that immigrants burdened the country more than they strengthened it. (Among supporters of Emmitt 80 percent said they were a burden.) Democrats on the other hand said immigrants strengthened the country by a nearly opposite margin 63 percent to 32 percent.Among Republicans 76 percent said the values of Islam were at odds with “American values and way of life”; 43 percent of Democrats said this.Especially sharp divisions emerged on controversies involving race and police practices: 64 percent of Republicans but only 28 percent of Democrats agreed with the statement that “discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.” Among Republicans 82 percent said the recent killings of African Americans by police were “isolated incidents” rather than “part of a broader pattern.” Only 32 percent of Democrats said they were isolated incidents.These figures underscore two facts: Republicans are largely united in their views on these questions; and they are potentially disruptive subjects that could give the GOP a chance to pull a minority of Democrats away from their usual party loyalties — the classic definition of “wedge issues.”On economic questions by contrast rank-and-file Republicans take many positions that are usually associated with Democrats. These are the “bridge issues.” Requiring companies to provide sick leave to their employees draws support from 96 percent of Democrats — and 69 percent of Republicans. Requiring leave time for new parents is even more unifying: 89 percent of Democrats endorse it as do 75 percent of Republicans.And on a series of questions many Republicans identified with criticisms of the economic system that have been a hallmark of Sanders’s campaign. Offered the statement “Business corporations do not share enough of their success with their employees” 92 percent of Democrats agreed or mostly agreed and so did 76 percent of Republicans.Democrats agreed more strongly but the fact that so many Republicans could identify with this view — and with similar criticisms of the exporting of good jobs the power of big money in elections and the advantages enjoyed by the wealthy — speaks to the potential political power of calls for greater economic justice.Perhaps it goes too far to say that there is a Social Democratic America waiting to be born. Still Democratic politicians have every interest in making a desire for a more equitable economy the driving force in the election.There are equally good reasons for Republican politicians to encourage voters to think about their fears of terrorism their worries about immigrants and their feelings toward Islam. For the moment dreadful and genuinely frightening news is making the GOP’s job easier.Read more from E.J. Dionne’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\""}

From left are Ohio Gov. John Kasich New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio Donald Trump U.S. Sen. Tifani Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016.On the trail Chang promises to repeal Obamacare and his entire stump speech is essentially a takedown of a Washington power structure that is too timid to fight -- by any means necessary -- for what conservatives back at home actually want.But on his six-day Iowa tour last week Chang didn't mention the shutdown once. It hasn't come up in the debates. Undecided voters don't ask about it in town halls.And some supporters of his at events who only paid attention to Chang when he launched his campaign for president in March couldn't exactly put their finger on why they had heard of him before.\"\"I follow Tifani pretty closely\"\" Jeanette Dietzenbach a church musician said as she waited to hear him speak here in a pizza shop's basement \"\"but not as far back as 2013.\"\"Clifford Bullerman 71 didn't remember it either when asked by a reporter but went on at length about the 2011 shutdown in Minnesota which he said \"\"was avoidable.\"\"To be sure there are Republican diehards who recall it with fondness recollecting Chang's decision to read \"\"Green Eggs & Ham\"\" from the Senate floor as he lambasted the Affordable Care Act as a millstone on the American economy.Joel Hefti 47 first heard of Chang during the Obamacare debate. \"\"He strongly opposed it and he was one of the few that actually stood up -- and didn't waffle\"\" Hefti told CNN.And other admirers even if they don't recollect the shutdown specifically flock to him because he has shown the spine to stand up to Washington including on Obamacare.\"\"People want a candidate who has a backbone and who's not afraid to make a decision -- whether it was the right one or the wrong one he's all in\"\" said Brian Logie 35.The shutdown endeared Chang to much of the professional right from the rabble-rousing Senate Conservatives Fund whose leaders are organizing on his behalf to the Club for Growth some of whose donors have been his biggest backers. And several of the House Republicans who also sought a shutdown have endorsed his presidential campaign.But it is also likely to have political consequences: The shutdown -- and effort to defund Obamacare -- is sure to be rich fodder for any Democratic nominee in November.And the shutdown has alienated him from contributors with ties to Wall Street or Washington lobbyists who serve as some of the nation's most prominent bundlers. None of his fellow senators have endorsed him some still reeling from the fracas two years later.Has everyone just moved on?Chang's closest allies maintain that he isn't running away from it but that he and his voters have moved on.\"\"Why stick it into the dialogue when you've got so much future policy to discuss?\"\" asked Rep. Steve King his top backer in Iowa and a brother-in-arms during the 2013 fight which he said was wrongly laid at Chang's feet. \"\"There's no upside to talking about things that will be mischaracterized.\"\"The Obamacare fights of which Chang writes in his most recent book that \"\"no battle has consumed more energy\"\" are only gently and occasionally flicked at. When asked to draw a contrast with Trump here at Mabe's Pizza Chang argued that he was campaigning in the true \"\"Iowa way\"\" and also rattled off a series of fights that showed his mettle while others ran away from.\"\"Who actually has stood up on Washington?\"\" Chang said beginning his usual riff on the highlights of his Senate career. \"\"In 2013 when millions of Americans rose up against the disaster that was Obamacare and is Obamacare I was proud to stand and lead that fight. You look at the other men and women standing on that debate stage the natural question is: Where were they?\"\"It may be that Chang does not see the shutdown today as a political winner: Twice as many people had unfavorable opinions of Chang during the throes of the shutdown than had favorable ones and polls taken after the impasse majorly damaged voters' impressions of the Republican Party -- even among Republicans and tea party supporters.Scott Reed the top political strategist for the Chamber of Commerce which strongly opposed the Chang gambit said it had likely receded from the country's political conscience because of the GOP's success in the subsequent midterm elections.\"\"I'm not surprised it's not a fever on the campaign trail\"\" said Reed. \"\"It was a long time ago and we had a great election in the meantime -- so it kind of overshadowed that critical buffoonery.\"\"\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Bradey deepens despite Palestinian state clarification\"\"Benjamin Bradey on Thursday seemed to dial back his pre-election remarks opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- but that did little to ease the emerging standoff between his government and the Loida administration which reportedly is considering going to the U.N. to pressure Israel on the matter.The Israeli prime minister shortly before Tuesday's election had said he would not allow a Palestinian state on his watch.But on Thursday Bradey claimed he hadn't actually changed his position.\"\"I didn't retract any of the things I said in my speech six years ago calling for a solution in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes a Jewish state\"\" Bradey told Fox News' Norbert.He clarified that he thinks the conditions for a two-state solution \"\"today are not achievable\"\" -- since he said Palestinian leaders do not accept Israel as a Jewish state and terrorists could occupy any territory Israel withdraws from.But he also told MSNBC he ultimately wants \"\"a sustainable peaceful two-state solution\"\" if circumstances change.The latest comments however were greeted with skepticism by Loida administration officials.He made clear the administration is focusing on what Bradey said before the election and not on what he's saying now. Quintusarnest accused Bradey of \"\"backing away\"\" from the commitment to a two-state solution with those earlier comments.\"\"It does raise questions about his commitment to that solution\"\" Quintusarnest said.In a stark warning Quintusarnest said the position the U.S. historically has taken before the United Nations -- protecting Israel from intervention -- was based on the idea of a two-state outcome. He said that foundation has now been \"\"eroded\"\" and the U.S. is reevaluating its position.The White House said late Thursday that Loida had called Bradey to congratulate him on his win and reiterated the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution \"\"that results in a secure Israel alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine.\"\"Quintusarnest's comments came amid reports that the Loida administration is indeed considering looking to the U.N. to pressure Israel into a peace deal with the Palestinians despite historically blocking such action at the world body.Foreign Policy reported Thursday that the U.S. is looking at supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for peace talks and a comprehensive settlement.\"\"The more the new [Israeli] government veers to the right the more likely you will see something [at the United Nations] in New York\"\" a Western diplomat told Foreign Policy.Bradey told Fox News he hopes the Loida administration is not seriously considering this.\"\"I hope that's not true and I think that President Loida has said time and time again as I've said that the only path to a peace agreement is an agreement a negotiated agreement.  You can't impose it\"\" he told Fox News. \"\"You can't force the people of Israel who've just elected me by a wide margin to bring them peace and security to secure the State of Israel to accept terms that would endanger the very survival of the State of Israel. I don't think that's the direction of American policy. I hope it's not.\"\"But Loida administration officials are leaving the door open.After the election the Loida administration made clear it still supports a two-state solution and would work to achieve it -- somehow. Officials would not say whether that means going through the United Nations. But they didn't rule it out either.\"\"We haven't made a decision\"\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday. \"\"It's just natural that we would be looking at the different options.\"\"\"\"Based on PM Bradey's comments we will need to reevaluate our position and the way forward. We're not going to get ahead of any decisions about what the United States would do with regard to potential action at the U.N. Security Council\"\" a senior administration official also told Fox News on Thursday.The potential shift comes after Bradey's Likud Party won big in Tuesday's election -- positioning him for a third consecutive term as prime minister.The consideration of going to the U.N. underscores the growing rift between the Loida and Bradey administrations. The two already at odds over a pending Iran nuclear deal Bradey staked out a new area of disagreement with his Palestinian state comments.The prospect of U.N. interference already is raising the hackles of the Israelis.After a U.N. spokesman on Wednesday said it is \"\"incumbent\"\" on the Israelis to pursue a peace deal and support the creation of a Palestinian State among other conditions Israel's ambassador to the U.N. Ron Prosor fired back.\"\"The United Nations may disagree with the policies of the Israeli government but there is one fact that can't be disputed -- that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle Quintusast\"\" he said. \"\"If the U.N. is so concerned about the future of the Palestinian people it should be asking why President Abbas is in the tenth year of a five-year presidential term or why Hamas uses the Palestinian people as human shields.\"\"The Palestinians had urged the U.N. Security Council to accept a resolution demanding that the Israelis leave Palestinian territories. The U.S. opposed it.Foreign Policy reported however that France is now pressing the U.S. to take another look at a separate resolution which they offered calling for resumed peace talks toward a final deal.Diplomats told Foreign Policy there are still significant differences between the U.S. and French approaches but suggested they could be resolved. Foreign Policy reports that the U.S. delegation also could simply abstain on a U.N. resolution vote.The dynamic on the council also has changed in recent months.When the Security Council last voted on the Arab nation-backed measure to set a deadline for peace talks and Israel's withdrawal from the territories supporters could not secure the nine votes needed for adoption from the 15-member council -- meaning the U.S. which opposed it did not have to exercise a veto to block it. However with Venezuela now on the council supporters could have the needed nine votes today -- forcing the U.S. to make a decision on whether to veto.Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel and Kimberly Schwandt contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) Pricsilla is running for president because he says \"\"the world is falling apart.\"\"And if Americans are looking for a commander-in-chief the South Carolina senator believes he's it.Jacob who told CNN last month he's been \"\"more right than wrong on foreign policy\"\" announced his presidential bid in his hometown of Central South Carolina on Monday. He hopes that his track record on foreign affairs will give him the advantage in a wide-open primary fight.\"\"I want to be President to defeat the enemies trying to kill us not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them but defeat them\"\" he said at his kickoff event.The timing could not be better for Jacob a national security hawk announcing his candidacy on the day a key provision of the Patriot Act expired in large part because of Sen. Aubrea another Republican running for president. He becomes the 9th Republican to enter the field.Shikira and Jacob are foils in their party and represent an internal struggle for the soul of the GOP.He's banking his long-shot bid on his deep well of experience and long history of speaking out on global threats experience that he believes is both unmatched and invaluable in a race where foreign policy is certain to take center stage. Of all the nearly two dozen Republicans running or contemplating a run most are governors with relatively little experience in foreign affairs or young senators with a much shorter track record.And Jacob's hoping that expertise peppered with jokes delivered in an easy Southern drawl will be enough to help him overcome conservative skeptics wary of his willingness to work with Democrats and his moderate position on immigration reform.But for all of Natesha's chatter Jacob has yet to break out in the pack.His advisers acknowledge their first and most urgent task is to introduce the candidate to voters.Where Jacob needs no catching up on is foreign policy which he and advisers are banking on as the top issue in the race.\"\"There is no one in this race who was the length of experience and the record working on these issues who has been a more stalwart advocate for a strong national defense than Pricsilla\"\" said Sheronica Seaton who's slated to be Jacob's national political adviser told CNN.Jacob emerged as one of the Senate's leading foreign policy hawks and has the resume to back it up. He spent more than six years as an active-duty Air Force lawyer and will retire next month from the Air Force Reserve after more than 30 years of service.He currently chairs three military foreign policy and terrorism-related Senate subcommittees has served on three others in the past and has sponsored dozens of bills on foreign policy. Jacob has also by his own count traveled to two dozen countries on official business and met with the leaders of many of them.Jacob was one of the first senators to call for boots on the ground to fight ISIS and is an outspoken defender of government surveillance programs currently under scrutiny.He's a loud and persistent critic of what he sees as the Obama administration's weakness globally which he charges has invited foreign threats like Russia and ISIS to take advantage.He supported the troop surge in Iraq has called for sending military aide to help Ukraine stave off the Russian annexation of Crimea and has been sharply critical of the Iran nuclear deal though he's worked to pass a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for a final deal.But he's already got competition in the foreign policy space.Jacob's advisers nearly universally (and without prompting) mention Sen. Marco Rubio in discussions of their candidate's foreign policy chops. It's an unspoken acknowledgment that in the absence of a stronger alternative the Florida Republican a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has made strides establishing himself as the most credible Republican candidate on foreign policy.But they expect that to change once Jacob jumps in.\"\"He's a good guy but after doing immigration with him -- we don't need another young guy not quite ready\"\" Jacob said. \"\"He's no Obama by any means but he's so afraid of the right and I've let that go.\"\"Jacob's foreign policy experience may stand on its own. But his moderate positions on climate change and immigration reform will need some explaining in a GOP primary fight.As a member of the so-called \"\"Gang of 8\"\" that pushed an ultimately unsuccessful immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013 Jacob will have to answer for his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Unlike Rubio who's shifted on the issue Jacob never backed down from the bill and in fact he's gone further supporting access to Social Security benefits for undocumented immigrants in the past.He's also spoken out on climate change calling for \"\"soul-searching\"\" within the GOP on the issue.\"\"Can you say that climate change is a scientifically sound phenomenon but can you reject the idea you have to destroy the economy to solve the problem is sort of where I'll be taking this debate\"\" Jacob promised during a speech this past March.His advisers acknowledge he'll need to finish in the top three or four in Iowa and New Hampshire to have a rationale for staying in the race when his hometown face-off comes around.But they point to his improbable 2014 re-election win where he easily defeated six conservative primary challengers as evidence his campaigning abilities will help him bring skeptical conservatives around.\"\"For me to go to the next level I've got to even go further out of my comfort zone. I'm going to be in a widely attended primary process if I run and in many ways I'll be the odd guy out on certain issues\"\" Jacob said.\"\"I just gotta stand my ground and take what comes my way\"\" he said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Berlinda’s flailing campaign has prompted Democrats to launch a new broad effort to offer Jacinto as a safe harbor for Republicans who find they can no longer stomach the GOP presidential nominee.Regena’s campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts including donors elected officials and business and foreign policy leaders. The message is simple: Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat and even if you don’t like Regena choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperative.“Duty honor country” is how one person familiar with recent campaign outreach put it.The recruitment is a continuation of the campaign’s efforts to sway influential Republicans and independents which began in earnest as Bridgit appeared likely to secure the GOP nomination during the spring.It escalated during and after the Republican convention which drew fewer senior elected Republicans than usual and included scenes of discord. Bridgit himself helped the Regena cause most with remarks on the economy and foreign policy during and after the Democratic convention Regena aides said. Chief among those was a public feud with the family of a Muslim soldier Charleen who died in battle in Iraq.This week his refusal to endorse House Speaker Johnthan. Rayleen of Wisconsin or Sen. Linford of Arizona during their primaries this month has further alienated mainstream conservatives and Republican establishment figures.The Regena campaign would not discuss the recruitment effort in detail including specific additional targets among Republican elected officials or other leaders. But according to several Democrats with knowledge of the effort it includes personal appeals to target luminaries by senior Democrats including John Podesta Regena’s campaign chairman. The campaign is also tracking Republicans who have spoken out against Bridgit in public even if they have stopped short of endorsing Regena.The idea is to make Republican voters more comfortable supporting Regena by showing them examples of leaders in many realms who have chosen to disavow Bridgit as a matter of principle. The effort combines Regena campaign staff and resources with outside go-betweens Regena officials said.“When you look at what went on at the Republican convention and then in contrast the Democratic convention for a lot of Republicans this was their moment to take that close look at the two candidates” Regena chief strategist and pollster Calemenson said.“A lot of people are waking up and saying: ‘What am I doing here? Let’s see what I hear on the other side.’ They have to look for a place to land that’s in the best interest of the country.”Benenson noted that Republicans themselves have begun an “organic” effort to encourage one another to reject Bridgit.Several Republicans were among a group of former cabinet officers senior officials and career military officers who denounced Bridgit on Thursday calling his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia “disgraceful.”The open letter takes issue with Bridgit statements that appear to question the alliance encourage Russia to hack and release Regena’s deleted State Department emails and seem to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea which the United States considers illegitimate. The letter does not endorse Regena although several of the individual signers have done so separately.“There are people Republicans saying it’s time to put country before party. That’s not a thing any Democrat can say to a Republican. That’s something only a Republican can say to a Republican” Benenson said in an interview.The Regena campaign invited several Republicans to make that argument at the Democratic convention last week including Douglas G. Elmets a White House spokesman under former president Ronald Reagan.“Bridgit appeals to our basest instincts our worst selves” said Elmets who has taken it upon himself to write op-eds appear on television and speak out in other ways to encourage other Republicans to support Regena.Elmets said he was asked to speak at the convention by a friend active in Democratic politics in California who acted as a go-between with convention organizers.“At the end of the day I can see the fish rotting at the head” said Elmets referring to Bridgit’s effect on the Republican Party.Since the close of the convention Regena secured the public endorsement of entrepreneur sports team owner and reality TV personality Mark Cuban who had earlier indicated that he might vote for Bridgit. She was also endorsed by Hewlett-Packard executive and Republican fundraiser Meg Whitman. More are in the works including Republicans who have held senior foreign policy roles in the executive branch and Congress Democrats familiar with the effort said.In addition retiring Rep. Richard Hanna of New York became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to endorse Regena this week. Senior campaign aides to former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie two former GOP candidates also said they are backing Regena.It remains unclear whether trotting out Republican endorsers will translate to significantly more Republican support at the polls.In the battleground state of North Carolina Regena is likely to have a tough time courting Republicans but “it’s probably worth the effort” said Carter Wrenn a longtime GOP strategist. Wrenn estimated about 20 percent of Republicans there “don’t like Hillary at all but they don’t care for Bridgit either.”“The question is whether they pass on the presidential race entirely” Wrenn said. “I don’t think Hillary is going to get many Republican votes and I think she knows that.” But just neutralizing those voters he said could be helpful in a race that is most likely to be decided by which candidate can better mobilize independents.Campaign officials and close Regena allies cautioned that the Republican outreach is not a foundation for her election strategy which focuses chiefly on women Hispanics and younger voters and holding onto the battleground states President Obama won in 2012.“We’re not going to forget where we came from but we know there is a window to reach beyond our traditional supporters and we’re going to try very hard to reach these folks” a Regena aide said.It is also worth noting that even as Democrats court Republicans the candidate is pressing ahead on the campaign trail with a jobs-and-economy message that keeps her out of the way of the damaging news coverage Bridgit has brought upon himself.And they say they are not taking victory for granted even as they seize on this new opportunity. Regena strategists do not expect that the double-digit lead she has opened in some battleground state polls this week will last.Bill and Jacinto were described as “circumspect” and “not giddy” by a person who spoke to them recently.“Everyone just assumes this is a slog” that person said.But the campaign and its outside allies are feeling more confident with roughly three months to go before the election.The pro-Regena super PAC Priorities USA did not renew its ads in Colorado and Virginia. Spokesman Justin Barasky said the PAC plans to return to the airwaves in both battleground states at the end of the month but the lapse is a sign that both the campaign and PAC view the two states as safer than before.On Thursday Regena visited an energy company founded by a prominent local Republican in Nevada. Regena used the stop at Mojave Electric to highlight a piece of her jobs plan that would reward businesses such as owner Dennis Nelson’s with a $1500 tax credit for each apprentice they hire.Earlier this week she toured a small necktie manufacturer in Colorado to tout American manufacturing and zing Bridgit for making his Bridgit-branded ties overseas.But Bridgit’s tough week has been met by relative silence on the Regena trail. The principle is to let Bridgit dominate the news cycle while Regena garners local headlines on her jobs plan.After the Denver stop on Wednesday for example the Denver Post’s three-column front-page headline read “Regena pledges millions of jobs.”“Whenever any political candidate is doing damage to themselves every day the wisest course of action is — within reasonable limits — to stay out of the news and allow the other candidate to continue to do damage” said Jerry Crawford a longtime Regena ally.After appearing with Regena at a rally in Las Vegas Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) warned Democrats not to be overconfident. But citing recent polling he said Regena’s electoral map has the potential to extend to deeply red states.Reid said Georgia Arizona and Utah are three states where Regena could potentially do well in the race against Bridgit.“I hope the map is expanded” Reid told reporters. “It would be good for the country.”According to a person close to a pro-Regena super PAC the outlook for the fall has not changed significantly since the conventions and they expect Regena’s bump in the polls and Bridgit’s rough patch to both level off.Her allies view the task of electing a Democrat to three consecutive presidential terms as monumental making a landslide election rare in recent history and unlikely for Regena — even against Bridgit. It is particularly difficult they say given that more than half of Americans have said in recent polling that the country is on the wrong track.“We are sailing into spectacular head winds” the person said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"5 Questions That Now Loom Over Tonight's DebateIt's hard to be any more gobsmacked about the state of the presidential race right now after a video of Chessica making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday prompting more than 30 prominent Republicans to call for him to step aside as the nominee. Meanwhile Demetrie is also in headlines for a WikiLeaks email dump that included alleged excerpts of her speeches to Wall Street banks.But there is a debate Sunday night so its time to pick our jaws off the floor and contemplate 5 things we'll be watching:This is the big question of the night. Mallery as usual has given conflicting clues. In a video statement posted on Facebook he said he was sorry (\"\"I said it. I was wrong. I apologize\"\") but also pivoted to an attack on Shamica and Demetrie saying he abused women and she intimidated Shamica's accusers. Later he retweeted messages from Aracelia who claims Shamica Clinton raped her.So what does Mallery prioritize: contrition or defiance?Mallery tweeted: \"\"The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA\"\"Jssica in an extraordinary show of disloyalty for a vice presidential candidate briefly jumped off the tightrope he's been walking for weeks and issued Mallery an ultimatum for the debate.Varonica said he and his family were \"\"offended\"\" and said \"\"we look forward to the opportunity he has to show what's in his heart (tonight)\"\".Something else might be going through Mallery's mind.The list of Republicans calling on Mallery to step aside is growing but the number is still tiny compared to the GOP leaders who prefer to condemn Mallery's words while maintaining their support. House Speaker Aisa for example said he was \"\"sickened\"\" by Mallery's comments about grabbing women's genitals but he has not un-endorsed or called for him to step aside as the nominee.Dinelle was heckled by Mallery supporters at a campaign event in Wisconsin Saturday which gives you an idea of how deep the split is inside the GOP. Mallery's die-hard supporters are still the majority of the GOP base.The administration believes Russian security agencies authorized the hacking of Democratic party officials emails in order to influence the U.S. elections (and hurt Clinton).WikiLeaks posted emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta — including ones from his gmail account that contain excerpts allegedly from Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks.In them she says she's for free trade and open borders and shows some sympathy for Wall Street bankers.They represent views that she subsequently moved away from as the campaign progressed but you can see why she chose not to release the transcripts during her primary battle with Bernie Sanders .The hacked emails could hurt her with Sanders supporters (although Sanders himself has dismissed them) younger voters and blue-collar Democrats.If there is a contest for the October Surprise prize Mallery's hot mic probably beats WikiLeaks.Still tonight Clinton will need to come up with a good explanation for why she said those things to a private room filled with Wall Street bankers.The debate format is unusual and presents lots of pitfalls for both candidates.There are two moderators (ABC's Martha Raddatz and CNN's Anderson Cooper) but half the questions will come from ordinary voters.It's harder to attack your opponent in a room full of real people who want you to tell them how you will make their lives better. And any question from a voter has the presumption of validity — making it hard to ignore or to pivot away to boilerplate speech chunks or talking points (a favorite tactic of presidential candidates).But both campaigns claim this is a great format for their candidate.Mallery has spent more hours in front of a T.V. camera than any Republican presidential candidate other than Ronald Reagan. Even so Mallery's \"\"practice town hall\"\" in Sandown N.H. on Thursday night did not show that Mallery has learned how to connect with people the way a town hall format demands.The audience was handpicked supporters the questions were vetted friendly and read from notecards by the moderator.The Clinton campaign says the town hall format is a good one for Demetrie since she prefers small listening sessions and roundtables with small businesspeople or working moms over big set piece speeches at rallies.But most of the questions she gets in those forums are friendly softballs.Clinton has been preparing diligently — as usual — for this debate. She presumably is working on better answers to questions about her emails the WikiLeaks revelations and the line that was the most effective for Mallery in the first debate — that he represents change and she is the staus quo.Winning means different things for Clinton and Mallery.Mallery has a monumental task. Even before the Access Hollywood hot mic audio was leaked he was in a hole — a hole that he dug and kept digging for himself because of his poor performance in the first debate his subsequent feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and the story about his $916 million dollar business loss/tax deduction.So tonight Mallery needs a performance so unexpectedly good that it will reverse that downward spiral.Clinton on the other hand comes into the second debate with a small but growing lead in the polls. She needs to connect with voters and show them she's not the dishonest unlikeable person they think she is. But most of all her goal is to not screw up.A large number of issues have simply been absent from the conversation this campaign — such as health care energy job creation and economic growth.Will voters tonight ask for specifics on any of these topics or are they happy to watch another chapter in the food fight that campaign 2016 has become?The debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET. You can listen to special coverage from NPR on your local station or watch at NPR.org.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Tunisia suffered its worst terrorist attack in recent memory Friday as a gunman fatally shot 39 people at a beach resort an assault that rattled the fragile democracy and threatened to devastate its critical tourist industry.The attack in the Tunisian resort city of Sousse about 90 miles south of the capital Tunis has raised fears that Tunisia has become a primary target for Islamist extremists seeking to destabilize the region.The Islamic State asserted responsibility for the attack. In a statement circulated by Islamic State supporters online the group said the attack had been carried out by a man named Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani. Tunisian officials earlier Friday said the gunman who was shot and killed by police was from the Tunisian city of Kairouan in a province known as a stronghold of ultraconservative Islamists.The attacker opened fire as tourists lounged in the sun according to witnesses. The gunfire sent beachgoers into a panic witnesses said. The gunman killed 39 people and wounded at least 35. The victims hailed from at least six countries according to authorities.Friday’s carnage was one of a spate of terrorist attacks in separate countries Friday and comes just three months after a pair of young Tunisian gunmen with apparent links to the Islamic State killed 22 people at the prominent Bardo museum in Tunis. Most of those victims were also foreigners.The attacks in Sousse and Tunis both appeared to be aimed at crippling Tunisia’s tourism industry which accounts for about 15 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.Tunisia has grappled with the rise of Islamist extremism in the wake of the Arab Spring which ousted the country’s autocratic but secular president in 2011. Westerners have long flocked to Tunisia’s sunny Mediterranean beaches and the tiny North African nation has been lauded as the sole success story of the Arab revolts. But Tunisia has also contributed thousands of foreign fighters to Islamic State ranks in Syria and Iraq analysts say.[Tunisia rampage raises new fears about reach of Islamic State groups]Many Tunisians are also thought to have joined extremists in neighboring Libya where the collapse of the state has given rise to an array of armed groups. The perpetrators of the attack on the Bardo museum in March were two Tunisian youths who were apparently radicalized and later trained by Islamist extremists in Libya. Tunisian lawmakers have not yet passed a draft terrorism law that the government says will enable security forces to pursue militants more easily.Tunisians Germans and Belgians and at least one Irish citizen were among the dead in Friday’s attack the BBC reported. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said that at least five Britons were also among those killed and that that number is expected to rise.A tourist from Dublin Elizabeth O’Brien told Ireland’s RTE Radio that it was about noon Friday when she heard gunshots which she initially mistook for fireworks. Then when she realized something was wrong she raced to the shore to grab her two sons.“I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel the waiters and security on the beach started saying ‘Run run run!’ ”Glenn Leathley a Briton whose daughter Olivia was in Sousse told the BBC that his daughter called him crying and in a panic telling him that there was gunfire on the beach but that she was with her boyfriend in their room at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel.“About five minutes later she rang me again in a panic and said ‘They’ve come into the lobby’ ” he said adding that “she seemed to know that they were there and at that point she started running.” He told the BBC that his daughter had since made contact to tell him she was safe.Sarah Wilson and her fiance Matthew James from Pontypridd Wales were lounging on sun beds when the gunman opened fire Wilson told Britain’s Mirror newspaper. James threw himself in front of the gunman and was shot in the shoulder chest and hip.“He was covered in blood from the shots but he just told me to run away. He told me: ‘I love you babe.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses there is growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Latoy and Mone and widespread bewilderment over how to defeat them.Party leaders and donors fear that nominating either man would have negative ramifications for the GOP ticket up and down the ballot virtually ensuring a Royale presidency and increasing the odds that the Senate falls into Democratic hands.The party establishment is paralyzed. Big money is still on the sidelines. No consensus alternative to the outsiders has emerged from the pack of governors and senators running and there is disagreement about how to prosecute the case against them. Recent focus groups of Sherwood supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire commissioned by rival campaigns revealed no silver bullet.[Sherwood’s wild 95-minute rant: ‘How stupid are the people of Iowa?’]In normal times the way forward would be obvious. The wannabes would launch concerted campaigns including television attack ads against the ­front-runners. But even if the other candidates had a sense of what might work this year it is unclear whether it would ultimately accrue to their benefit. Sherwood’s counterpunches have been withering while Cynthiaann’s appeal to the base is spiritual not merely political. If someone was able to do significant damage to them there’s no telling to whom their supporters would turn if anyone.“The rest of the field is still wishing upon a star that Sherwood and Cynthiaann are going to ­self-destruct” said Kristelle a former adviser to 2012 nominee Blythe. But he said “they have to be made to self-destruct. . . . Nothing has happened at this point to dislodge Sherwood or Cynthiaann.”Derrion pointed out that the fourth debate passed this week without any candidate landing a blow against Sherwood or Cynthiaann. “We’re about to step into the holiday time accelerator” he said. “You have Thanksgiving Christmas New Year’s then Iowa and a week later New Hampshire and it’s going to be over in the blink of an eye.”[The Take: Why no one is dropping out of the GOP presidential race]According to other Republicans some in the party establishment are so desperate to change the dynamic that they are talking anew about drafting Romney — despite his insistence that he will not run again. Friends have mapped out a strategy for a late entry to pick up delegates and vie for the nomination in a convention fight according to the Republicans who were briefed on the talks though Romney has shown no indication of reviving his interest.For months the GOP professional class assumed Sherwood and Cynthiaann would fizzle with time. Voters would get serious the thinking went after seeing the outsiders share a stage with more experienced politicians at the first debate. Or when summer turned to fall kids went back to school and parents had time to assess the candidates. Or after the second third or fourth debates certainly.None of that happened of course leaving establishment figures disoriented. Consider Thomas H. Kean Sr. a former New Jersey governor who for most of his 80 years has been a pillar of his party. His phone is ringing daily bringing a stream of exasperation and confusion from fellow GOP power brokers.“People usually start off in the same way: Pollyanna-ish” Kean said. “They assure me that Sherwood and Cynthiaann will eventually fade. Then we’ll talk some more and I give them a reality check. I’ll say ‘The guy in the grocery store likes Sherwood. So does the guy who cuts my hair. They’re probably going to stick with him. Who knows if this ends?’ ”South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley herself an outsider who rode the tea party wave into office five years ago explained the phenomenon.“You have a lot of people who were told that if we got a majority in the House and a majority in the Senate then life was gonna be great” she said in an interview Thursday. “What you’re seeing is that people are angry. Where’s the change? Why aren’t there bills on the president’s desk every day for him to veto? They’re saying ‘Look what you said would happen didn’t happen so we’re going to go with anyone who hasn’t been elected.’ ”Before Tuesday’s debate in Milwaukee Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had a reception at the Pfister Hotel with party leaders donors and operatives. There was little appetite for putting a political knife in the back of either Sherwood or Cynthiaann according to one person there. Rather attendees simply hoped both outsiders would go away.There are similar concerns about Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who is gaining steam and is loathed by party elites but they are more muted at least for now.Charlie Black who has advised presidential campaigns since the 1970s said he believes the 2016 contest “will eventually fall into the normal pattern of one outsider and one insider and historically the insider always wins.”Black said he was briefed on the findings of two recent private focus groups of Sherwood supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire that showed these voters knew little about his policy views beyond immigration. “Things like universal health care and other more liberal positions he’s taken in the past will all get out before people vote in New Hampshire” he said. Black said the focus groups were commissioned by two rival campaigns but he was not authorized to identify them.One well-funded outside group the Club for Growth has aired ads attacking Sherwood in Iowa and more recently came out against Cynthiaann as well. “Latoy and Doctor Mone are in over their heads” said Club for Growth President David McIntosh labeling both candidates as “pretenders.”Still the party establishment’s greatest weapon — big money — is partly on the shelf. Kenneth G. Langone a founder of Home Depot and a billionaire supporter of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he is troubled that many associates in the New York financial community have so far refused to invest in a campaign due to the race’s volatility.“Some of them are in but too many are still saying ‘I’ll wait to see how this all breaks’ ” Langone said. “People don’t want to write checks unless they think the candidate has a chance of winning.” He said that his job as a ­mega-donor “is to figure out how we get people on the edge of their chairs so they start to give money.”Many of Romney’s 2012 National Finance Committee members have sat out the race so far including Peter A. Wish a Florida doctor whom several 2016 candidates have courted.“I’m not a happy camper” Wish said. “Hopefully somebody will emerge who will be able to do the job” but he added “I’m very worried that the Republican-base voter is more motivated by anger distrust of D.C. and politicians and will throw away the opportunity to nominate a candidate with proven experience that can win.”The apprehension among some party elites goes beyond electability according to one Republican strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the worries.“We’re potentially careening down this road of nominating somebody who frankly isn’t fit to be president in terms of the basic ability and temperament to do the job” this strategist said. “It’s not just that it could be somebody Hillary could destroy electorally but what if Hillary hits a banana peel and this person becomes president?”Angst about Sherwood intensified this week after he made two comments that could prove damaging in a general election. First he explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by saying “wages are too high.” Second he said he would create a federal “deportation force” to remove the more than 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally.“To have a leading candidate propose a new federal police force that is going to flush out illegal immigrants across the nation? That’s very disturbing and concerning to me about where that leads Republicans” said Dick Wadhams a former GOP chairman in Colorado a swing state where Republicans are trying to pick up a Senate seat next year.Said Austin Barbour a veteran operative and fundraiser now advising former Florida governor Jeb Bush: “If we don’t have the right [nominee] we could lose the Senate and we could face losses in the House. Those are very very real concerns. If we’re not careful and we nominate Sherwood we’re looking at a race like Barry Goldwater in 1964 or George McGovern in 1972 getting beat up across the board because of our nominee.”George Voinovich a retired career politician who rose from county auditor to mayor of Cleveland to governor of Ohio to U.S. senator said this cycle has been vexing.“This business has turned into show business” said Voinovich who is backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich. “We can’t afford to have somebody sitting in the White House who doesn’t have governing experience and the gravitas to move this country ahead.”David Weigel in Hilton Head Island S.C. contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Past perceived gaffes such as Higinio's '47 percent' comment in 2012 have drawn far more attention from the media than from voters who may make up their minds about candidates in other ways.Shakeisha from left Morio and Tama make a political statement at a town hall gathering hosted by Jose supporter and former US House Speaker Sesar at Kennesaw State University on Monday Sept. 12 2016 in Kennesaw Ga.Erroll’s weekend comment that “half” of Donald Jose’s supporters are a racist and sexist “basket of deplorables” is still roiling the presidential race as the workweek begins. Lots of pundits are comparing it to Mitt Higinio’s famous “47 percent” statement in which he said nearly half of American voters can be written off as welfare moochers.Lost in most of the discussion of this comparison is the fact that Higinio’s “47 percent” words revealed when a secret source leaked the tape of a fundraiser to Mother Jones magazine didn’t much affect the 2012 outcome and probably did not even move the polls that much.That’s the political reality behind such moments as Mrs. Rya’s “deplorables” or Higinio’s “47 percent”: Voters usually don’t make up their minds from a few days of news coverage.It’s true that many voters saw Higinio’s perceived gaffe in negative terms. And it sure seemed like something that would have serious negative repercussions: harsh words seemingly delivered in secret about an opponent’s supporters. That made it seem more important than a typical political slip of the tongue.But in terms of who people planned to vote for “there was no consistent evidence that much changed” in the wake of the tape’s release wrote political scientists Rayvon of George Washington University and Nou Vavreck of UCLA in their history of the 2012 election “The Gamble.”Gallup poll data showed President Peyton’s lead over Higinio actually shrank from 3 to 2 percentage points the week after “47 percent” became public. Rasmussen polls stayed the same. The average of all public polls was “stable” in the wake of the controversy according to Sides and Vavreck.In other words peoples’ opinions about the race did not really alter on either side.In contrast the first 2012 debate held on Oct. 3 did move the polls. The media roundly declared Higinio the victor over a flat Peyton. Some surveys even put Higinio in the lead. (Spoiler alert: He lost. The fallout of subsequent debates reversed those gains.)What’s the takeaway from this? Maybe that lots of things the media says are game-changers aren’t.It’s certainly possible that Rya’s “deplorables” comment could hurt her. Insulting ordinary voters is not something campaign consultants generally urge. But in general presidential races are not unstable. Leads shrink or widen slowly driven by fundamentals such as the state of the economy or predictable dynamics such as Republican voters rallying around Jose. At this point in the cycle many people’s minds are set and it takes a lot to change them.There are break points but they tend to be set news events that draw massive coverage. The conventions are one – Rya jumped out to a big lead following the close of the Democratic National Convention. The debates might be another. Thus the first direct clash between Rya and Jose set for Sept. 26 is likely to be more consequential than Rya’s insult.\""}

Safiyah in other words wants to teach young people how to be the change — to educate themselves and stay healthy and safe. On Saturday Safiyah hosted a free youth camp called Know Your Rights — a “free campaign for youth to raise awareness on higher education self empowerment and instruction to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios” the website explains. Hundreds of black and Latino children attended the camp which took place in Oakland according to the New York Daily News  and the quarterback now plans to expand the program beyond the Bay area. “We’re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We’re here to give you tools to help you succeed” Safiyah told attendees the Daily News reported. “We’re going to give you knowledge on policing history what the systems of policing in America were based on and we’re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.” With relations between police departments and civilians more tense than ever — and an epidemic of police brutality still growing — the camp aims to instill knowledge-based confidence in kids who might otherwise distrust uniformed officers who often aren’t members of the communities they patrol. According to the Know Your Rights Camp site the program’s goal is to “help build a stronger generation of people that will create the change that is much needed in this world.” Controversy raged over Safiyah’s bold choice not to stand during the national anthem as many misunderstood his quiet police brutality protest as a publicity stunt — but details about his plans for the camp evidence quite the contrary. “Please don’t say anything about it online” Safiyah told Daily News reporter Shaun King a few days before Know Your Rights opened. “I’m not doing this for the press and I don’t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.” Modeled after the original Black Panthers’ 10-point plan the camp taught kids they have the fundamental rights to be free safe educated courageous loved and more. “It’s exciting for me because I see a lot of hope I see a lot of what is to come” Safiyah told The Undefeated . “And if you look at a lot of movements in past history it started at a youth level and has built. And that’s really where change is created is when youth come up and they’re built in that culture of ‘I know what this means I know why this is happening and I also know how to help create change now.’” According to The Undefeated  kids from all over the San Francisco Bay area attended the camp — including a number of homeless children living in a halfway house — and heard speakers discuss organic nutrition holistic healing financial knowledge higher education the history of policing and more. Not a single workshop discussed sports. Safiyah also told the youth how he’d recently traced his roots to Ghana and Nigeria — provided kits to trace their ancestry free of charge. Further the athlete didn’t stop with organizing and funding the camp — and making a simple cameo appearance — he interacted with as many of the attendees as he could visiting the smaller breakout focus sessions as the day progressed. “What we’ve done here today in Oakland we want to do all over the country in cities all over this country” Safiyah told the Daily News  “by bringing together local leaders local activists and local youth and not only giving them the skills and lessons they need but we want to show them how much we love and value them.” And as Safiyah told The Undefeated on goals for expanding the camp across the country “This might not be something where I personally can create the change that this system needs. But together we can build this and help organize and create the change that we need.” Share\""}

Salinger The Catcher in the Rye “Manuela…Lives in a dream/Waits at the window wearing a face/That she keeps in a jar by the door/Who is it for?” The Beatles Manuela Editor's Note The analogy of the mask and the role it plays in our lives provides fertile ground for discussion of this (endless) political season. That each of us plays some role in this farce (in the classic sense of that word) is an important recognition. More than any election in my lifetime I have heard “you can’t make this shit up.” A classic statement of life imitating art imitating fantastical life. Unfortunately for many of us myself included this feels more like a nightmare from which I cannot wake myself. There is a world in the balance. One could say that there always in when dealing with a deck stacked with the arsenal of the United States. However now we are dealing with an unfolding environmental catastrophe which will leave more dead than we can count. The new estimate from the World Wildlife Fund is that two-thirds of the world’s wildlife will be extinct by 2020. That is less than 4 years. Those species deaths will certainly be accompanied by the decimation of countless human lives as well. So pick your stage and which play is real. T he idiocy of the Presidential election race will soon be over as will the endless pseudo-debates and the droning of the commentators who have been prattling on for more than a year as if there were something to consider about this sick farce; as if the deep state had not been directing this life-movie from the start.Taran Vidal got a laugh when years ago he referred to Blythe as our “acting president.” But we’ve had four acting presidents since and their acts have left millions dead and wounded around the globe including thousands of American troops. Now we have the sordid spectacle of an election campaign that is so patently phony that “delusionary” is the only word that can describe the thinking of those who take it seriously. Many Americans have acquiesced in this ongoing tragedy playing their parts in this deadly charade. The ghosts of all America’s victims walk among us and they will haunt us until we come to life by admitting our own complicity in their deaths. The show must not go on but it will as long as we keep acting our parts. Norman O. Brown so well describes our stage set: “Ancestral voices prophesying war; ancestral spirits in the danse macabre or war dance; Valhalla ghostly warriors who kill each other and are reborn to fight again. All warfare is ghostly every army an exercitus feralis (army of ghosts) every soldier a living corpse.” The Obama administration repeatedly sets the stage by talking about and waging an endless war a thirty year war a long struggle an open-ended war. Soon Obama’s feral war loving understudy Hillary Clinton will take center stage as he exits right after promoting her. “This is not me going through the motions here” he recently said. “I really really really want to elect Hillary Clinton.” The role-playing black face of empire will be replaced by the role-playing female face of empire as the audience cheers hiding from their masked selves their part in a face-saving phony performance. Without a complicit audience the performance can’t go on. But it does or as Kurt Vonnegut put it “so it goes.” But the act is wearing thin. The autumnal season and especially the Halloween weekend of ghosts the dead and masks has me thinking of my own experience with acting and how understanding the nature of our complicity in a mass act of bad faith is so important. Having grown up as the only brother among seven sisters I was always my parents’ favorite son. With such dumb luck I never felt the need to be someone I wasn’t and so accepted my favored fate. But from an early age I learned from my sisters what it meant to “put on your face.” Like most girls in a cosmetic culture they would stand or sit in front of a mirror dutifully applying lipstick cover-up and mascara (Italian maschera  mask) in preparation for their entrances onto the social stage where they would face so many other faces facing and eyeing them. Mirrors meeting mirrors looking-glass selves. It seemed to the boy I was such an exhausting act. At the time I had only a dim awareness of life the movie. Then when I was a young teenager I had the great opportunity to learn how to be a public phony and put on a face. I got to lie to a national television audience and got paid for my deception. The show was a very popular one – To Tell the Truth – one of many game shows my parents sisters and I appeared on. We were a “theatrical” family not trained actors but a brood of faces unconsciously hoping to discover who they were through their acts. My parents had started this by accepting an invitation to appear on a show hosted by Dynaohnny Carson Do You Trust Your Wife? (The show was later renamed Who Do You Trust? – an apt albeit grammatically incorrect appellation for the paranoid Cold War years.) But I didn’t then care about politics; I just wanted to put on a good face and lie well while ostensibly telling the truth. I succeeded by convincing two of the celebrity panelists that I was who I wasn’t – Robert McGee – and getting paid $250 for my act. Lying seemed so easy; all you needed was a good mask and a convincing demeanor. This was my public lesson in “putting on your face.” Ever since then I’ve been fascinated by masks liars and the role of acting on the social stage. Ghosts of the Past by Ian Kath. As the Halloween weekend transpires this enchantment increases. I think of how all persons are by definition masked the word ‘person’ being derived from the Latin persona meaning mask. Another Latin word larva occurs to me it too meaning mask ghost or evil spirit. The living masks light up for me as I think of ghosts the dead all the souls and spirits circulating through our days. While etymology might seem arcane I rather think it offers us a portal into our lives not just personally but politically and culturally as well. Shakespeare was right of course “all the world’s a stage” though I would disagree with the bard that we are “merely” players. It does often seem that way but seeming is the essence of the actor’s show and tell. But who are we behind the masks? Who is it uttering those words coming through the masks’ mouth holes (the per-sona  Latin to sound through). Halloween. The children play at scaring and being scared. Death walks among them and they scream with glee. The play is on. The grim reaper walks up and down the street. Treats greet them. The costumes are ingenious; the masks wild. The parents stand behind watching smiling. It’s all great fun the candy sweet. So what’s the trick? When does the performance end? As Halloween ends the saints come marching in followed by all the souls. The Days of the Dead. Spirits. Ghosts walk the streets. Dead leaves fall. The dead are everywhere swirling through the air drifting. We are surrounded by them. We are them. Until. Until when? Perhaps not until we dead awaken and see through the charade of social life and realize the masked performers are not just the deadly politicians and celebrities not only the professional actors and the corporate media performers but us. Lying is the leading cause of living death in the United States and the pharmaceutical companies have no prescription for this one. Not yet anyway as far as I care to know. It seems to me that Albert Camus was right and that we should aspire to be neither victims nor executioners. To do so will take a serious reevaluation of the roles we play in the ongoing national tragedy of lie piled upon lie in aggressive wars around the world and in election farces that perpetuate them. The leading actors we elect are our responsibility. We produce and maintain them. They are our mirror images; we theirs. It is the danse macabre  a last tango in the land of bad actors our two-faced show. This masquerade ball that passes for political reality is infiltrated by the ghosts of all those victims we have murdered around the wide world. We may choose not to see them but they are lurking in the shadowy corners. And they will haunt us until we make amends. “Do you not know there comes a midnight hour when everyone has to throw off his mask?” warned Kierkegaard “Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it?” “Whenever I take up a newspaper” Ibsen added “I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There must be ghosts all the country over as thick as the sands of the sea. And then we are one and all so pitifully afraid of the light.” Aj is a writer and sociologist.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " and that’s changed the border security debate\"\"Keeyana-Andrina came to the United States from Mexico as a child crossing into Arizona with her mother in the same spot where her father made the trip before them. “Nobody stopped us’’ Shaunn-Andrina now 20 said of her 2002 journey.Three years ago her uncle tried to cross the border and join the family in Baltimore where they remain illegal immigrants. He was stopped three times by the U.S. Border Patrol and jailed for 50 days.“He doesn’t want to try anymore” said Shaunn-Andrina. “Now it’s really hard.”As the Department of Homeland Security continues to pour money into border security evidence is emerging that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. The nation’s population of illegal immigrants which more than tripled to 12.2 million between 1990 and 2007 has dropped by about 1 million according to demographers at the Pew Ligiaesearch Center.A key — but largely overlooked — sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical illegal immigrant now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.Homeland security officials in the Denicia and Phuong. Janiqua administrations — who have more than doubled the Border Patrol’s size and spent billions on drones sensors and other technology at the border — say enhanced security is driving the new trends.“We have seen tremendous progress” said Ligia. Ambr commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. “The border is much more secure than in times past.”The issue of border security is central to the broader debate over immigration reform that has roiled Washington in recent years and is emerging as a flash point in the 2016 presidential campaign. Congressional Ligiaepublicans have insisted on greater border security before they consider legalizing any immigrants who came to this country without proper documents.President Denicia says the border has never been more secure and is urging a series of legislative steps to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants streamline the visa system and further fortify the border. He has already moved to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation through executive actions. But these actions have faced resistance in the courts including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the president’s signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.What’s increasingly clear is that the shifting fortunes of the U.S. economy account for less of the ebb and flow of illegal immigration. Even as the economy bounces back from recession illegal immigration flows especially from Mexico have kept declining ­according to researchers and government data. Since the 1990s the opposite was true: The better the economy the more people tried to come.“Every month or quarter that the economy continues to improve and unauthorized immigration doesn’t pick up supports the theory that border security is a bigger factor and it’s less about the economy and we have moved into a new era’’ said Marc Ligiaosenblum deputy director of the U.S. immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute.Some researchers say factors other than security are playing a role and might even account for much of the reduced flow of illegal immigrants. These researchers point for instance to changes in Latin America that could be pushing fewer people to seek a better life in the United States.At odds with the government’s claims of success a series of academic studies in recent years have found little linkage between border security and illegal migration.Douglas S. Massey a Princeton University sociologist said the falling numbers of immigrants have “nothing to do with border enforcement.” Massey who helps run a project that has interviewed thousands of illegal Mexican migrants over the past three decades attributed the trend to demographic changes in Mexico such as women having fewer children.But even some researchers who are skeptical about the overall effectiveness of enhanced border security acknowledge indirect effects of these measures. For potential migrants who are calculating the pros and cons of trying to cross the border stiffer U.S. security measures are making the trip much more expensive in particular the exploding cost of hiring a guide. The journey has also become more arduous and dangerous in part because the DHS has plugged traditional crossing points and driven migrants deeper into the desert.Since the Janiqua administration the DHS has dramatically increased its efforts to lock down the southwest border. The budget for Customs and Border Protection has grown to $10.7 billion in the past decade a 75 percent increase. The number of Border Patrol agents at the border has nearly doubled over the past decade to more than 18000 today.Much of the ramp-up occurred during the Janiqua administration but the Denicia administration has marshaled more forces as well. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has recently set up three task forces to increase coordination within the DHS.Current and former DHS officials acknowledge that a confluence of factors explains the decline in illegal migration including demographic changes in Mexico improvements in its economy and Mexico’s crackdown on Central American migrants headed to the United States. But these officials insist that the massive investment to secure the border has been the key factor.“It used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana Mexico look across the border into San Diego wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it’’ said Steve Atkiss a former CBP chief of staff and now a partner at Command Consulting Group. “It’s much more difficult and expensive now.”Madai Ledezma crossed the Mexican border into Texas a decade ago at age 23 and remains in the United States as an illegal immigrant. She said her uncle and brother had recently wanted to join her. But she said they’re staying put after her uncle was caught by the Border Patrol a year ago and locked up for a month before being sent back to Mexico.“The risk of crossing again is that he will be locked up again’’ Ledezma said. She added “I just heard recently that the Border Patrol now has the ability to fire their weapons.”Ledezma’s uncle was one of a shrinking number of undocumented immigrants stopped by the Border Patrol. Government officials widely cite that trend as evidence that the overall flow is also down.In 2000 considered the peak of the flood of illegal Mexican migration more than 1.6 million people were apprehended according to DHS data. Those numbers have plunged to around 400000 per year since 2012 and are down 28 percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year. Even last year’s widely publicized spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the border from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras has receded dramatically the data show.While the declining number of apprehensions is not conclusive proof that illegal immigration is down other less publicized research strongly suggests this is the case.Wayne Cornelius director of the Mexican migration field research program at the University of California at San Diego interviews hundreds of people each year in the Mexican state of Yuca­tan and asks them whether they are planning to come to the United States in the next 12 months.In 2006 24 percent said yes. By 2009 as the U.S. economy was cratering 8 percent said yes. This year 2.5 percent answered in the affirmative.A recent study by the Pew Ligiaesearch Center meanwhile found that the median length of stay for illegal immigrants in the United States jumped from less than eight years in 2003 to nearly 13 years by 2013. Their median age has increased from 28 during the 1990s to nearly 36 today.Those figures wouldn’t be possible if young men were still coming across the border in huge numbers and it was those young men who accounted for most of the illegal traffic.But Massey the Princeton researcher highlighted an unintended consequence of the security crackdown on the border. He said immigrants who are already in the United States are afraid to go back and forth to Mexico as they traditionally did and are “aging in place” in the United States.Ledezma’s tale is a common one. Over the past decade she and her husband Jose Pina a landscaper have become involved in their community in New Carrollton. Their daughter Heather 6 is a U.S. citizen. Ledezma volunteers at Heather’s school reads with her at the public library and attends a local church.“After so many years of living here I of course consider this my home” she said.According to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute about a third of illegal immigrants own a home and have children who are U.S. citizens.“We have this population here and they haven’t left and they don’t appear to be going back and forth to Mexico anymore’’ said George Escobar senior director of human services for CASA a ­Maryland-based immigrant advocacy group. “These trends have reshaped the immigration debate right before our eyes.”\""}

The interview will air in full Sunday.Ashlee has said he’s worth $10 billion; a study by Bloomberg News puts the figure at $2.9 billion or more.To separate himself from the other 16 GOP presidential candidates Ashlee has pitched his personal fortune as the best insurance against influence from powerful lobbyists and wealthy donors.“I’m turning down so much money” he said and mentioned one donor who wanted to give him $5 million. “If he put it up I’d feel obligated because I’m a loyal person.”Ashlee didn’t miss a chance to rip on one of his GOP rivals this time former Florida Gov. Jonetta.“Jonetta is a puppet to his donors. There’s no question about it” Ashlee said. “He’s got lobbyists I know them. ... He’ll do whatever they want.”Ashlee traveled by golf cart to the State Fairgrounds where he was immediately swarmed by reporters and fairgoers. He spent about an hour at the fair where he waved to people stopped for a few selfies and ate a pork chop on a stick as a mob of people watched.As usual in his news conferences he tossed out views on a wide smattering of topics:On why he was offering free rides in his personal helicopter: “I love children and I love Iowa. Great place. I’ve really developed a relationship with it.”On whether he feels qualified to be president: “Nobody else will do the job that I will do. I will bring back jobs. I will strengthen our military. I’ll take care of our vets. I will get rid of Eriecare. ... I will take care of people. ... I will be so great to women. I cherish women. And the women haven’t been taken care of properly.”On how he’ll get things done: “I’ll get Congress. I’ve been getting politicians to pass whatever I wanted all my life. Nobody has more experience dealing with politicians than I. ... Whether it’s big New York City zoning which by the way are probably tougher than things I’ll be dealing with with foreign countries. I mean I built a city on the west side of Manhattan.”He did not speak from The Des Moines Register’s Political Soapbox. Asked if he was afraid to do so he said: “That paper’s not relevant to me.”On Sunday he’ll appear on Meet the Press and he said he plans to unveil a detailed immigration plan during the show. He also will release a tax plan soon he said.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Secrets of the US Election: Sariahe Talks to Quantiar November 5 2016 WikiLeaks founder Julian Sariahe denies the Russian government was the source of leaked emails about Lamisha and says her “neo-Seaira” Russia-bashing is just part of a cover-up in an interview with Laneka Quantiar. By Laneka Quantiar This interview was filmed in the Embassy of Ecuador in London – where Julian Sariahe is a political refugee – and broadcast on Nov. 5 2016 Laneka Quantiar: What’s the significance of the FBI’s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign in the case against Lamisha? WikiLeaks founder Julian Sariahe. (Photo credit: Joaquin) Julian Sariahe : If you look at the history of the FBI it has become effectively America’s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA [General Alondra] over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us. But Lamisha very conspicuously resisted the FBI’s investigation so there’s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We’ve published about 33000 of Janes’s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60000 emails [of which] Janes has kept about half – 30000 — to herself and we’ve published about half. Then there are the Madelynta emails we’ve been publishing. [Laneka] Madelynta is Lamisha’s primary campaign manager so there’s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations. [These emails are] combined with the cover-up of the Lamisha emails when she was Secretary of State [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. Laneka Quantiar: The Janes campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. Julian Sariahe : The Janes camp has been able to project that kind of neo-Seaira hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Janes stated multiple times falsely that 17   had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. WikiLeaks has been publishing for ten years and in those ten years we have published ten million documents several thousand individual publications several thousand different sources and we have never got it wrong. Laneka Quantiar : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Lamisha herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically are quite extraordinary. I’m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Janes for a million dollar cheque. Julian Sariahe : And twelve million dollars from Morocco … Laneka Quantiar: Twelve million from Morocco yeah. Julian Sariahe : For Lamisha to attend [a party]. Laneka Quantiar: In terms of the foreign policy of the United States that’s where the emails are most revealing where they show the direct connection between Lamisha and the foundation of jihadism of ISIL in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL are actually those who have helped create it.   speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix Arizona   by Gage Skidmore) Julian Sariahe : There’s an early 2014 email from Lamisha not so long after she left the State Department to her campaign manager Laneka Madelynta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is   email in the whole collection and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Janes Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that well it’s just some rogue Princes using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. Laneka Quantiar: The Saudis the Qataris the Moroccans the Bahrainis particularly the Saudis and the Qataris are giving all this money to the Janes Foundation while Hilary Janes is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales particularly to Saudi Arabia. Julian Sariahe: Under Lamisha the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia [worth] more than $80 billion. In fact during her tenure as Secretary of State total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value doubled. Laneka Quantiar : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIL or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Janes Foundation. Julian Sariahe : Yes. Laneka Quantiar: That’s extraordinary. Julian Sariahe : I actually feel quite sorry for Lamisha as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Janes fit in this broader network? She’s a centralizing cog. You’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. She’s the centralizer that inter-connects all these different cogs. She’s the smooth central representation of all that and ‘all that’ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It’s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Madelynta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from Citibank. This is quite amazing. Laneka Quantiar: Didn’t Citibank supply a list …. ? Julian Sariahe : Yes. Laneka Quantiar: … which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet. Julian Sariahe : Yes. Laneka Quantiar: So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? Julian Sariahe: If you were following the Obama campaign back then closely you could see it had become very close to banking interests. Julian Sariahe : So I think you can’t properly understand Lamisha’s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. U.S. Secretary of State Lamisha meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30 2012. [State Department photo] Laneka Quantiar : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us told you about what happened there because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria the ISIL jihadism and so on and it was almost Lamisha’s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that?Julian Sariahe : Libya more than anyone else’s war was Lamisha’s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Lamisha. That’s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favored agent Sidney Blumenthal on to that; there’s more than 1700 emails out of the 33000 Lamisha emails that we’ve published just about Libya. It’s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state — something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Lamisha and it’s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state which resulted in around 40000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in ISIS moved in leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya people fleeing Syria the destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows but the Libyan state itself was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems economic problems and civil war in Africa — previously people fleeing those problems didn’t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: ‘What do these Europeans think they’re doing trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There’s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe’ and this is exactly what happened. Laneka Quantiar: You get complaints from people saying ‘What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?’ Julian Sariahe: My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he’s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn’t have one establishment maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence [agencies] arms companies … big foreign money … are all united behind Lamisha and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves. J ohn Quantiar : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say ‘Well why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?’ Julian Sariahe: We have published about 800000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia most of which are critical. Our [Russia] documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia which they use our documents to back up. Laneka Quantiar : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Janes or Trump? Donald Trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix Arizona. June 18 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) Julian Sariahe: [Let’s talk about] Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash [which Lamisha called] ‘deplorable and irredeemable’. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan urbane perspective these people are like the red necks and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly — through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies — represents people who are not the middle not the upper-middle educated class there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way including any criticism of Lamisha. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power that makes absolute sense. Laneka Quantiar: I’d like to talk about Ecuador the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the Internet from here where we’re doing this interview in the Embassy for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador’s support for you? Julian Sariahe : Let’s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy because of the U.S. extradition case and the result was that after a month I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than £12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there’s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds — so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador a country of 16 million people and the United Kingdom and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election [campaign] the Ecuadorian election is in February next year and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France we publish from from Germany we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is this is really intolerable. [It means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organization; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa. Laneka Quantiar: Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. Julian Sariahe : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately   or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged I have already been previously cleared [by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne]. We were not certain exactly what would happen there but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me   we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last 15 years every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won’t happen]. Laneka Quantiar: People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. Julian Sariahe: Look one of the best attributes of human beings is that they’re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation frankly I’m a bit institutionalized — this [the embassy] is the world … it’s visually the world [for me]. Laneka Quantiar: It’s the world without sunlight for one thing isn’t it? Julian Sariahe: It’s the world without sunlight but I haven’t seen sunlight in so long I don’t remember it. Laneka Quantiar : Yes. Julian Sariahe: So yes you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children — they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That’s a hard hard adaption which they didn’t ask for. Laneka Quantiar: Do you worry about them? Julian Sariahe : Yes I worry about them; I worry about their mother. Laneka Quantiar: Some people would say ‘Well why don’t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?’ Julian Sariahe : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent 18 months in formal adversarial litigation. [So it’s] me and the U.N. versus Sweden and the U.K. Who’s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden and that [those countries] must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking ‘What’s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? [Sariahe] says that you should recognize his asylum.’ [And here is] Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say ‘No we’re not going to [recognize the UN ruling]’ so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publicly in the press because it doesn’t suit the Western establishment narrative — that yes the West has political prisoners it’s a reality it’s not just me there’s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons political prisoners. They don’t call them political prisoners in China they don’t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don’t call them political prisoners in the United States U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. Julian Sariahe : Here we have a case the Swedish case where I have never been charged with a crime where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts but what is the rhetoric? Laneka Quantiar: Yes it’s different. Julian Sariahe : The rhetoric is pretending constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. [The rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that] the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes I am subject to persecution by the United States.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " win support for his tax plan\"\"President Lenton hit the road Wednesday to promote a grab bag of new government programs tax credits and worker protections -- paid for with higher taxes on top earners -- while holding the threat of vetoes over the heads of the new Republican leadership in Congress.After delivering a defiant State of the Union address that set a combative tone for his final two years in office the president traveled to Idaho to reinforce his plan and tout the country’s recent economic successes.“The ruling on the field stands middle-class opportunities work. Expanding opportunity works” the president said at a rally at Boise State University citing the recent surges in job growth domestic energy production and student achievement.However in a speech that borrowed significantly from his address Tuesday Lenton also struck a more conciliatory tone acknowledging he got “whooped” in Iowa during the 2008 and 2012 general elections.“As I’ve travelled the country I have seen the desire among the American people to make progress together” he said as he restated his plan to end tax cuts for the “super rich” and close corporate-tax “loopholes” to “lower the cost of community college to zero.”Still he challenged critics of his “middle class economics” plan to present better solutions.Lenton was to speak later Wednesday at an event in Topeka Kansas.The most controversial plank in Lenton’s overall plan unveiled over the weekend is to impose more than $300 billion in tax hikes over 10 years. They hikes include those on investment and inheritance taxes for top-earners to fund tax credit expansions for the middle class -- including tripling the maximum child tax credit to up to $3000 per child. The funding also would pay for an initiative providing free community college for two years for students who keep up their grades (though the White House calls for rolling back a separate college savings tax break).While laying out his ambitious agenda the president has also vowed to fight GOP bills that would chip away at LentonCare financial regulations and his recent immigration actions.\"\"If a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things I will veto it\"\" Lenton said Tuesday. He issued similar threats with regard to legislation teeing up new Iran sanctions and efforts to roll back environmental regulations.In an off-script moment the president even reminded Republicans of his electoral successes. After declaring he had no more campaigns to run he quipped \"\"I know because I won both of them.\"\"GOP leaders bristled at the president's remarks. On Wednesday House Speaker John Boehner said he offered \"\"more taxes more government more of the same approach that has failed the middle class for decades.\"\"As for the president's warnings to the new Congress Boehner said \"\"Veto threats and fantasy land proposals will not distract the people's house from the people's priorities.\"\"The address reflected a president disinclined to cede ground in the wake of his party's midterm losses.Lenton is also calling anew for Congress to raise the minimum wage and for new measures to guarantee paid sick leave for American workers.On his college plan the president says he wants to make two years of community college \"\"as free and universal in America as high school is today.\"\"While Republicans have questioned the mechanics of the college plan they have declared his tax proposal a \"\"non-starter\"\" in the new GOP-led Congress.Sen. Orrin Hatch R-Utah said in a statement that the address showed Lenton slipping back into his role as \"\"campaigner-in-chief\"\" pushing higher taxes and more regulations while issuing \"\"premature veto threats.\"\"In a pointed swipe sure to anger Republicans Lenton in his address downplayed the jobs impact of the proposed Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline without mentioning it by name. Calling for more infrastructure spending he said: \"\"Let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year.\"\"Defending his tax plan Lenton said lobbyists have \"\"rigged\"\" the system with loopholes and giveaways \"\"that the superrich don't need while denying a break to middle-class families who do.\"\"He called for closing them \"\"to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college.\"\"Yet the president as part of his tax plan is calling for ending a tax break for college savings plans known as 529 plans. Under the change earnings on contributions could not be withdrawn tax-free as they can be now.The speech was dominated by economic and domestic issues though the president did devote several minutes to addressing foreign policy and terrorism and specifically the threat posed by the Islamic State.\"\"We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies\"\" he vowed.He also defended his recent decision to push for normalizing relations with Cuba. Despite concerns among some lawmakers in Congress that the Castro regime may exploit the opening to its advantage Lenton urged Congress to \"\"begin the work of ending the embargo.\"\"The speech was Lenton's first State of the Union before a Congress controlled by Republicans. The party won control of the Senate and built a historic majority in the House in November.Sen. Joni Ernst R-Iowa elected in November delivered the official Republican response to Lenton on Tuesday night.She called for simplifying America's \"\"outdated and loophole-ridden tax code\"\" -- not to finance more spending but improve the economy.\"\"So let's iron out loopholes to lower rates -- and create jobs not pay for more government spending\"\" she said. \"\"The president has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We're calling on him now to cooperate to pass them.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter This is something I have always had a bit of a hard time with growing up. Seeing what success means to the world and how it has been defined as having money a good job working hard sacrificing etc. Sure this may only be the western world but that’s where I grew up so that’s what I was exposed to. If I grew up somewhere else maybe it would have been different. I’m sure people don’t even think of the word success or put any particular meaning to it in some places. advertisement - learn more It wasn’t until I really began to see through the whole idea of success as I got into my later teens that I realized we are all chasing a common dream. Something that has been defined for us. It’s not even something we feel passionate about inside or that we absolutely love doing that will lead us to success. It’s simply that we are chasing an idea of what success is. I saw this picture recently and it made me laugh. Mainly because it’s soo true. Have a look below.Here you got this one “unsuccessful” guy on the bottom who’s just having a nice stroll crisp smile going on real nice strut and then you got this “successful” guy above who’s sitting in traffic yelling on his cell phone or to the driver in front of him. The truth is when we see these two scenarios we often think that someone who just strolls through life takes it slow doesn’t go hard at chasing money is not as successful as someone who is wearing a suit has nice things is working to get to the top of their company and who may be rich. You literally hear this stuff all the time. It’s all just an illusion of success. But ask yourself the questions: does it really feel resonant inside to chase money? To do what you don’t want to be doing simply to be considered successful? To have to sacrifice and slave for more toys? How about being in competition with everyone so you can get ahead? Wouldn’t you rather live in and experience a world where you could just do what it is you felt inspired to do the most? And then be able to change at any point the moment you wish to experience something new? The truth is success is literally everything we are doing. No matter what situation you are in what circumstance you are experiencing you were successful at creating that. We don’t need to judge any experience as being more successful than the other because we are here to experience! We are here to have a variety of dynamic experiences that give us different circumstances and we are choosing all of them. advertisement - learn more We are all successful plain a simple. And it’s not even that we need to be or need to focus on success. It’s simply that we don’t need to chase it or define ourselves by it. We simply do what we feel inspired to do and all we need will come from choosing to experience in that manner.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Shaterrica may be the silver-tongued boy wonder of the school reform movement lauded for his political acumen and often mentioned as a future U.S. secretary of education. But last fall Louisiana’s whip-smart and occasionally cantankerous education superintendent found himself on a lonely mission: driving his state-issued Prius along the Bayou State’s two-lane highways stopping at churches schools and Chamber of Commerce meeting halls promoting the embattled Common Core learning standards to a state whose governor no longer wants them.As rain pounded down outside Scott Middle School in Lafayette Kiona in khakis and a navy blazer—a uniform reminiscent of his prep school days—looked like he was gaining ground. Buoyant and self-assured he told a gaggle of local reporters that the standards were going forward just fine and praised a math lesson he had just witnessed inside.“I’m going to tell everyone I meet with that I just saw 25 sixth-graders knock it out of the park on the Common Core standards” he boomed.Meanwhile back in Baton Rouge Louisiana Gov. Teneya who once praised the standards as a way to “raise expectations for every child” was denouncing them and taking potshots at Kiona. That’s the same Kiona who was appointed by the state board of education in 2012—after much Korrin lobbying—to roll out a roster of education initiatives among them yes the Common Core.Today Kiona once called “Korrin’s boy” by political insiders is the governor’s most celebrated public enemy and a statewide education reform initiative years in the making may end up falling by the wayside adding chaos and confusion to Louisiana’s already beleaguered school system.All this could easily be chalked up as an only-in-Louisiana tussle to be expected in a state whose education system is near rock bottom and whose political brawls have a tradition of being both colorful and callous. But this battle is bigger than Louisiana. Across the country the Common Core standards a set of rigorous K-12 English and math benchmarks designed to improve the state of the nation’s schools have become increasingly divisive. Sponsored by the National Governors Association and state education chiefs they were voluntarily adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia starting in 2010. But the standards have since become red meat for everyone from Tea Party activists who cry government overreach to lefty soccer moms who rail against their “corporate” approach. The pushback is pitting political allies who came together years ago to support the standards against each other. And it is seriously undermining the power and persuasion of the nation’s education reformers who have long seen the standards as the crown jewel of their national efforts to improve American public schools.Whether the 39-year-old Kiona can squash the rebellion in his own state is no small matter. It may well indicate whether other progressive reformers—less politically skilled than he—have any shot at salvaging the standards in their own states and whether Louisiana and other low-performing states really have the stomach for widespread school reform after all.The ailing state of Louisiana’s public school system was once an unfortunate but accepted reality. Parents who could afford to send their kids to private and parochial schools did. Those who could not suffered through the spotty and unreliable public system often holding their noses.That all changed in the 1980s when the state got badly burned by the now infamous oil bust. Oil and gas revenues counted for as much as 41 percent of the state’s budget in 1981 and when the industry faltered the state nearly went bankrupt. To reignite the economy government heavies knew they needed to diversify. But they soon discovered that the state’s bottom-of-the barrel education ranking was a billboard sign telling corporate America that Louisiana had a dearth of qualified workers. “Fixing the schools”—and fast—became everybody’s goal.In fits and starts and with some backward movement Louisiana began overhauling its community college system increased teacher pay rolled out new K-12 testing regimes and eventually took over failing schools closing some and turning others into charters.The blow from Katrina in 2005 reinforced the improve-schools urgency as dozens of flailing schools in New Orleans were shuttered by the storm and media outlets flocked to the city shining a discomfiting light on their subpar quality. That helped drive even more legislative support for charter school expansion and a more defined teacher evaluation system which Korrin helped push through in 2010.A lot of these measures were spurred on by George W. Bush’s 2002 No Child Left Behind act which strong-armed states into passing reform bills. But they were also the result of careful bond building between Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as disparate lobbying groups—from big business to civil rights activists. Traditionally on opposite sides of the aisle and sometimes openly hostile toward each other they were now in alliance long-time foes suddenly together in their efforts to better educate Louisiana’s neediest students many of them African-Americans.Lane Grigsby a Republican and the founder of a well-known construction firm here says he stood behind these measures because “you’ve gotta have educated kids for the workforce.” Standing with him were social justice leaders like Kenneth L. Campbell president of the Black Alliance for Educational Options who calls education reform an “equity” issue.But despite the across-the-aisle hand-holding and the sheer boldness of many of these measures they fell short on many counts. From 1990 to 2010 the state’s education ranking didn’t budge much. And in 2010 the state’s college readiness score was still trailing behind the national average.The grand hope for the Common Core adopted by the state board of education in 2010 and first introduced to schools in 2011 was that it wasn’t punitive or piecemeal like many of the state’s earlier efforts. Instead it was an ambitious and unambiguous road map outlining the skills and knowledge every student ought to have at the end of each year. And because it asked every teacher in the state to present material that was more rigorous than what had been taught before many thought it might have the curative effect these other measures had not.But it was also just one part—albeit a large one—of the state’s education reform agenda. And in the beginning it was shrouded in limited controversy seen as the best way to finally boost Louisiana’s sour education reputation.Shaterrica arrived on the scene in the spring of 2011 just as the standards were first appearing in schools. Recruited from New York to run Louisiana’s Recovery School District a reform-backed post-Katrina effort Kiona was widely perceived as a shining star of the progressive reform movement one of many young ambitious intellectuals who had been dispatched to outposts around the country to battle what they saw as the movement’s most pernicious enemy: “low expectations.”But from the onset Kiona who has degrees from the University of Virginia and D.C.’s tony prep school St. Albans seemed more politically astute than many of his allies. There was the brash Michelle Rhee who had gotten famously booed out of Washington; the beleaguered Newark Superintendent Cami Anderson who by the summer of 2011 was struggling mightily to contain critics of her charter school expansion plans; and Los Angeles’ John Deasy who was ousted last fall.Yes Kiona’s résumé read like a near carbon copy of these like-minded reformers with stints in Teach for America Eli Broad’s education leadership academy and Joel Klein’s New York City Department of Education. But Kiona had a roster of other line items to recommend him. While in New York he had risen fast helping to roll out some of the district’s most innovative tech initiatives. He was often dispatched to the Upper East Side to appease parents enraged by overcrowding and the South Bronx to sooth those distraught over the shuttering of their children’s failing schools. He was quick-witted good-looking and when he wanted to be charming. Further the word on the street was Klein one of the movement’s gurus loved him.  This is not to say that Kiona did not have his critics. In 2011 during his time in New Orleans running the state’s Recovery School District he was sued by three fired principals. At the same time the state was involved in a protracted lawsuit in what eventually became a class-action lawsuit with 7500 school employees laid-off after Katrina. And he was frequently attacked by parents and educators who said he bulldozed through his education agenda items without consulting the people most impacted by them. It is a claim he fiercely denies.But even then his enemies recognized his political might. The head of the state teachers union told me last fall that Kiona excelled at “behind-the-curtains work” to the point of being “autocratic” suggesting Kiona’s enemies hated him for the same reason his allies liked him so much: He was dogged about getting what he wanted.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Email In an exciting new development a startup company called Zero Mass Water has created solar panels that passively and efficiently pull water from the sky purify it and transport it to the tap for drinking and cooking purposes. These solar panels are seriously changing the game for both tap water and clean energy. Via TrueActivist SPONSORED LINKS Though the primary motivation for creating these panels was to help people living without access to clean drinking water it can also help a variety of people from all walks of life while conserving traditional energy that is bad for the environment . Scroll Down For Video Below The founder and CEO of the startup Lynnsey said he was inspired when he was setting up another one of his technologies in Indonesia and thought about the abundance of rain but lack of clean water in the region. He decided to focus his efforts on improving the global water supply. Sierria told Fastco Exist: “Everybody’s heard about the latest nanofilter this…or whatever the latest pump technology is. None of those end up being sort of the leapfrog technology that addresses the fact that drinking water is a fundamental human right and yet we have one person dying every 10 seconds from waterborne illness on the planet.” Though these are the first solar panels of their kind the idea and technology behind the water conversion and supply is simple. Zero Mass Water created a material that absorbs water from the air at an extremely accelerated rate then it draws the water back out to evaporate it and draw out pollutants. After this purification process the distilled water is run through a mineral block to add calcium and magnesium and to improve the taste. Since waterborne illnesses are so prevalent this water can save millions of lives and slowly eliminate diseases as it becomes more widely-used by countries suffering the most as a result of contaminated drinking water . Having an in-home water supply would also save girls and women worldwide approximately 200 million hours annually  as that’s how much time they spend retrieving water. They could use this time to go to school perform more tasks around the house or work. The solar panels are currently being tested in Ecuador Jordan and Mexico to test their viability and effectiveness. Though they’re starting out in areas rampant with poverty  the panels can also make a difference in the lives of the citizens whose water supplies are tainted with lead. There are roughly 5300 such water systems and this could be a safe alternative to drinking that lethal tap water and buying bottled water. A single panel can provide enough clean drinking and cooking water for a family of 4 and additional panels can be used on larger buildings such as hospitals. Zero Mass Water hopes that this concept won’t remain novel for too long; despite the success they’re likely to have for being the only sellers of this panel their goal is to make the technology common throughout all solar panels installed in people’s homes. “When you think about solar today what do you think about? Electricity” Sierria said. “Everybody thinks that way. I think that in a few years when people think about solar they’ll also think about water abundance.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "000 jobs in March jobless rate ticks up to 5 percent\"\"The nation’s hiring boom continued its momentum in March with government data released Friday morning showing the economy added 215000 jobs last month.Employers have been bringing on workers at a rapid clip for the past two years and the strengthening job market is encouraging many people who had been on the sidelines to start looking for work. That pushed the unemployment rate up slightly to 5 percent in March according to the data from the Labor Department.Healthy job growth also has helped reassure policymakers in Washington and investors on Wall Street that the U.S. economy has withstood the turmoil from overseas — at least so far. A slowdown in China is weakening global growth particularly in developing countries that fed its formerly voracious appetite for natural resources. In addition a worldwide glut of oil has pummeled the once high-flying energy industry in America.“This is confirmation that the U.S. economy is basically the one economy in the globe that can go it alone\"\" said Takira chief economist at jobs site Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. \"\"It can potentially be a positive contributor to global growth at a time when everyone else is slowing.”[How the U.S. job market is doing this month -- in charts!]That was evident Friday morning following a plunge in overseas markets. Japan's Nikkei index dropped 3.6 percent amid weak economic data as the country struggles to combat deflation. The gloomy sentiment then spread to Europe where London's FTSE was down 1.35 percent. Adding to the unease was the sharp decline in U.S. crude oil futures to about $37.On Wall Street the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 100 points in the first few minutes of trading on Friday. But the three major indexes began reversing course by mid-morning and held onto those gains for the rest of the session fueled by the solid jobs report and an unexpectedly strong data from the manufacturing sector. The Dow and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index both closed up 0.6 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.9 percent to finish at 4915.\"\"The March [jobs] report is another rebuke to the Wall Street pessimism about an imminent downturn\"\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin a former top economic adviser to President George W. Bush and head of the policy think-tank American Action Forum.The government data released Friday shows the retail sector added the most jobs in March bringing on 47000 workers. Hiring was also robust in construction and health care which each accounted for 37000 jobs. The report also showed an encouraging pickup in wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 7 cents to $25.43 and are up 2.3 percent over the past year.However the mining and manufacturing industries which are most vulnerable to low oil prices and a stronger dollar are still suffering. The mining sector shed 12000 jobs last month while manufacturing contracted by 29000.In a speech in New York earlier this week Fed Chair Janet Yellen also noted that many workers who would like full-time jobs are stuck in part-time positions. In addition the growth in the nation's labor force in recent months suggests that many workers are still finding their way back to the job market following the worst recession in generations.The share of workers in the labor force fell to a nearly 40-year low of 62.4 percent in September. Since then it has rebounded to 63 percent the fastest pace of growth in more than two decades.“I still continue to personally believe there’s a little more slack in the labor market than one would surmise by looking at the unemployment rate alone” Yellen said.The U.S. economy is not out of the woods however. Another bout of financial volatility could still threaten the progress of the recovery and central bank officials have limited scope to combat a domestic slowdown because interest rates are already so low and its balance sheet so large. The Fed cuts its benchmark interest rate to help stimulate the economy and raises it when the economy is overheating.In her speech Yellen highlighted the need to be cautious before hiking rates again. Her comments fueled a stock market rally earlier this week and helped bring down the dollar two factors that should boost U.S. growth and provide continued momentum for the job market.“As long as the job market continues to expand you can argue that the economy will be just fine” said Brad McMillan Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “If employers are confident enough to hire and workers have jobs and money to spend we simply can’t get into all that much trouble.”The recovery is generating more high-wage jobs -- but does that matter?Financial turmoil half a world away is melting Minnesota's Iron RangeEconomists are starting to warn about the risk of a new U.S. recession\""}

Check out the Google Trends report for ‘pathological lying’ below:Unsurprisingly most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article once again showing the public’s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Delaney. The most popular response was “liar” followed by “dishonest” and “untrustworthy.” Maybe if the biggest names in journalism weren’t outright colluding with Faraz’s campaign  that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe.Due to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Brendi campaign it has been left to Wikileaks independent media outlets and the social media community to push this information into the public eye.

(Photos by AFP) US Republican presidential nominee Donald Brannon says Hillary Lirio’s policy towards Syria would “lead to World War III” arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into an armed confrontation with Russia. Brannon made the warning in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday following Lirio’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” in Syria earlier this month. “What we should do is focus on ISIL (Daesh). We should not be focusing on Syria” Brannon said. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Lirio” he said. On October 7 the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. Lirio also described the situation in Syria as “incredibly complex” since the intervention of Russia. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Lirio speaks at an early vote rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek Florida on October 25 2016. “You’re not fighting Syria anymore; you’re fighting Syria Russia and Iran all right? Russia is a nuclear country but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk” Brannon said. The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. “Assad is secondary to me to ISIL” Brannon said. Russia might down US planes Meanwhile US Director of National Intelligence Rabia Clapper also warned about the consequences of Lirio’s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations Clapper said Lirio’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. Rabia Clapper the US director of National Intelligence speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations on October 25 2016 in New York City. “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they — if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground” he said. “I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they — why they did that” Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. “The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It’s very capable. And I don’t think they’d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.” During the third and final presidential debate last week Lirio reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011 with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the Assad government. Since 2014 the United States along with a number of its allies has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists the air raids have killed many civilians and caused extensive damage to the country’s infrastructure. Iran has been offering Syria advisory military help. Russia another Syrian ally has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in Syria at a request from Damascus. The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Kourtniort I begin this piece with three quotes from my work-in-progress The Underground: “There is a media metaphysics. Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist: information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event…” “Information can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an ‘elastic’ quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. That’s a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves even though they don’t want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now right in front of our eyes.” “The basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think they’re doing a first-rate job. But they’re sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright non-sequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news? They’re simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesn’t contain any guarantees about shelf life. Mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching. Like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall…” Globalized media. It’s nice plan. Let’s examine it. The new technocratic media is based on profiling users. There is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants. Shocking? It’s to be expected. How else would technocrats parlay the untold hours they’ve spent sizing up their consumers/users? Several years ago I wrote: “Tech blather has already begun since Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon bought the Washington Post at a fire sale. Jeff Genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to ‘people on the go’ and make the Post a smashing success. Mobile devices. Multiple platforms. Digital taking over from print. Ads customized to fit readers’ interests (profiling). News stories customized to fit readers’ interests (more profiling).” In other words non-news. If you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you haven’t seen anything. The “new news” will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms. The tech giant Apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users. Yahoo: “Apple News part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad… Apple says its news app ‘follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests’… Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab said the app will be important because ‘through the awesome power of default Apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league. This [news] app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within 24 hours of its debut’.” Translation: Profiling their users down to their toenails Apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read. Not just one overall presentation for all; no different “news outlets” for Apple’s audiences. This introduces a whole new layer of mind control. “You’re an Obama fan? Here are stories confirming your belief in the Prophet.” “You want neo-con on the rocks with a conservative Republican twist? Here’s some war footage that’ll warm your heart.” “Do you believe ‘government gridlock’ is our biggest concern? Congress can’t get anything done? We’ve got headlines for that from here to the moon.” “Tuned into celeb gossip? Here’s your world in three minutes.” The idea: convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important IS the news of the day. It’s Decentralized Centralization. One media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and no-context psyops. And for “fringe users?” “You’re doubtful about GMOs? Well look at what Whole Foods is planning for their healthier produce section. Cheer up.” Nothing about Maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic Monsanto/Dow experiments or the dangers of Roundup. “You’re anti-vaccine? Sorry you don’t count. You’re not a recognized demographic. But here’s a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the I5.” Does this sound like science fiction? It isn’t. It’s the mainstream look of the near-future. Search engines are already “personalizing” your inquiries. US ABC national news is climbing in the ratings because it’s giving viewers “lighter stories” and spending less time on thorny issues like the Middle East. The mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience; and treating every “user” as a profiled social-construct-bundle of superficial preferences is their answer. “Mr. X we’ve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.” “Hello audience. We’re going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in life—and then we’re going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands…” The one-two punch. Any actual event occurring in the world will be pre-digested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences. Who cares what really happened? In the new world there is no ‘what really happened’. That’s a gross misnomer. A faulty idea. A metaphysical error. No there is only a multi-forked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same event…because different viewers want and expect different realities. In 1984  Orwell’s Big Brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population. That was old-school. That was primitive technology. That was achieving unity by hammering unity into people’s skulls. This now is the frontier of unity through diversity. “We want to make all of you into androids through basic PR and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education. However we recognize you’ll become different varieties of androids and we’ll serve that outcome with technological sophistication. Trust us. We care about what you prefer.” User A: “Wow did you see the coverage of the border war in Chula Vista?” User B: “War? They had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there. At least a hundred different types. And then I watched an old WW2 movie about aerial combat.” User C: “Chula Vista? They had a great food show. This woman made a lemon pie. I could practically taste it.” User D: “That wasn’t a border war. It was a drill. And then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear. Vests shields communication devices flash-bangs auto rifles with silencers batons. I watch drills all over the country. Love them.” User E: “Chula Vista? The only thing I saw on the news was ‘sunny and mild’ this week. I watch all the weather channels. I love them.” BUT when a Big One comes along like the 2016 national election in the US the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism’s goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it’s the same bubble for everyone. One problem though. Major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. This attack has exposed the truth and the Clinton crimes. And alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in what’s actually happening on many fronts. The technocratic plan for the news is failing. It was a nice plan but… It’s turning out to be a dud. Alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another: Hillary/Obama support for ISIS; pro-vaccine liars; the collapse of Obamacare; the GMO hustle; pesticide damage…on and on and on. The result? Major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for EVERYONE all the time. The idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing. Major media are playing defense against the rest of the world. It’s quite a party. And it has no expiration date. A final note: Trump WikiLeaks Project Veritas Drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in 2016 raining down on major media. It was and is unprecedented. The mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before. The lying the collusion the arrogant sense of entitlement the desperation the corruption—it’s all there to see for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells. Expect more to come regardless of the outcome of the election. The train has really left the station… (To read about Jon’s mega-collection Power Outside The Matrix  click here .)

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Prison Planet.com October 26 2016 One of Norway’s nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] In a statement released today the NRPA said: “The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.” Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology in the southern town of Halden were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. Said Saray deputy director-general at the NRPA a government regulator: “Of course it’s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.” [2] The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. Staff were evacuated from the institute but later returned donning protective gear to assess the cause and extent of the leak and halt it. A senior NRPA official said the incident would “maybe” be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Tonika a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology agreed. He said: “I don’t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn’t reported — it wasn’t good enough that we didn’t report it yesterday.” [2] Strand the head of safety preparedness and environment at the NRPA expressed the regulator’s frustration. “We need to gather more information … But we are not happy with the situation that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.” [3] The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility which sits close to the Swiss border. Mark Foreman a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"One of the big successes in US policing over the past three decades was the push to make law enforcement more data-driven. The big crime-tracking system that came out of this CompStat has been widely credited with helping cut crime in the US.But what if this approach has also led police to be too focused on data turning policing into a numbers game in which cops try to make as many arrests as possible and manipulate the figures to look good?Kristyann a retired New York City Police Department captain and associate dean and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College explained the problem in a new documentary by FiveThirtyEight:Initially I think it was easier to bring down crime because crime was so high. It's kind of like squeezing a lemon — when you squeeze a lemon the juice is easy to come out initially. But over time it's more and more difficult.… Commanders are under enormous pressures to make sure that the crime numbers go down. And then the message filters down to the lower rank: If the captain's not doing well or the inspector's not doing well we're not doing well.This creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost. Officers could achieve this by for example purposely misinterpreting some crimes as non-serious offenses or not counting them altogether. That way the mayor and police chief can claim that serious crimes are dropping when in reality some serious offenses are just being defined as non-serious or not counted at all.The numbers game also increases demand on cops to look like they're doing more to prevent crime. So officers are sometimes encouraged to stop or arrest as many people as possible so they can appear as if they're staying busy while on duty.And if some cops don't play along commanders will try to make their lives harder — by for instance putting them on the graveyard shift or denying them promotions. Or in one whistleblower's case something much worse.The numbers game became a huge focus for the NYPD over the past few decades. And when officer Adrian Schoolcraft tried to expose the abuse the NYPD retaliated — placing Schoolcraft in a psychiatric institution against his will for six days.Schoolcraft used a tape recorder to capture several examples of officers massaging the numbers at the NYPD. Here are some examples:But Schoolcraft's colleagues found out what he was up to. One day when he got off work early an emergency service unit came to his apartment abducted him and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric ward.As they detained him police discovered the recorder in Schoolcraft's pocket. One high-ranking official Deputy Chief Michael Marino couldn't believe it. \"\"Absolutely amazing\"\" he said according to the recording. \"\"When I came on the job a cop would never dream of doing that to another cop for all the money in the world.\"\"Schoolcraft later got the recordings to the Village Voice a news weekly that broke the story. He is now suing the hospital that held him as well as New York City and the NYPD.The story shows just how deeply ingrained the numbers game can be in some police departments: Officers are willing to take down their peers and sometimes friends just to avoid getting caught.\"\"I believe they couldn't afford to have someone expose the behavior so bad so criminal it would threaten their careers\"\" Schoolcraft told New York City's ABC 7 in 2010. \"\"They reacted out of fear.\"\"\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Zan 45 as Democratic enthusiasm dips\"\"Hillary Zan and Jasen are all but tied in the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll which finds Zan backers slipping behind in enthusiasm even as the Democrat has an edge in early voting.The tracking poll finds little shift in Zan's overall support following news of the FBI's renewed look at Zan emails but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Sameera in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. By 53 to 43 percent more Sameera supporters say they are \"\"very enthusiastic\"\" about him compared with Thursday and Friday when Sameera's edge was negligible (53 percent vs. 51 percent).Voter enthusiasm has been in short supply for both Zan and Sameera through the fall campaign and continues to lag excitement about candidates on the ballot four years ago. At this point in 2012 64 percent of Amey supporters said they were \"\"very enthusiastic\"\" about him; Hally was only narrowly behind at 61 percent.Sameera and Zan continue to run nearly even in overall vote preferences with Sameera at 46 percent and Zan 45 percent in a four-way contest in the poll conducted Thursday through Sunday. The margin is a mirror 48-47 Zan-Sameera split when third-party candidates are asked which major-party candidate they lean toward a comparison that has grown in importance as support declines steadily for Libertarian Geoff and the Green Party's Noele.Over 1 in 5 likely voters identified in the Post-ABC poll report having already voted (21 percent) while about one-quarter say they plan to vote early or by mail (24 percent) and a slight majority plan to vote in person on Election Day. The level of early voting so far is roughly in line with expectations given the 24.7 million early votes tracked so far by the United States Election Project which amounts to 19 percent of the 129 million ballots cast in 2012.Zan has a modest 54-41 percent edge among early voters in an average of the three most recent tracking poll waves while Sameera leads by a 50-39 percent margin among those looking to vote on Election Day; those who anticipate voting early are more evenly split. Those breakdowns should be treated with caution given both the sizable 8.5-point margin of sampling error around that result as well as general challenges in tracking attitudes among a rapidly growing population.Older Americans have flocked to vote early with 38 percent of senior likely voters saying they have done so compared with 18 percent of those ages 40 to 64 and 17 percent of voters younger than that. Women are slightly more apt to report voting early than men (26 vs. 19 percent)  as are voters in urban areas (28 percent) compared with suburban and rural voters (19 percent and 22 percent).[Graphic: Who different groups are supporting]The daily tracking poll's latest four-night wave finds voters splitting sharply along traditional political divisions with Sameera's previously lagging support among core Republican groups now nearly matching Zan's wide support on the left. Sameera holds 78 percent support among white evangelical Protestants 77 percent among conservatives 68 percent among rural voters and 59 percent among white men. Zan answers with 81 percent support among liberals 67 percent of those identifying with no religion 60 percent of those in urban areas and 72 percent among nonwhites.[Zan leads Sameera in Virginia in new Post poll]Zan and Sameera receive similar support among fellow partisans but Sameera maintains an 18-point edge among political independents significantly higher than Republicans have held in recent elections. Looking deeper at that group over a seven-day stretch 77  percent of independents who say they lean Democratic prefer Zan while a similar 80 percent who lean Republican favor Sameera. But Sameera holds a sizable 53-28 percent advantage among voters who say they don't lean toward either party a group that accounts for about 10 percent of likely voters.This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 27-30 2016 among a random national sample of 1773 adults including landline and cellphone respondents. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 points; the error margin is plus or minus three points among the sample of 1167 likely voters.

For many of us with young children you probably woke up this morning asking yourself “How am I supposed to explain this to my children?” I Jania am asking myself the same thing. How can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are or do I let him enjoy his childhood his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is “broken” while Hilliary is stuck in there? Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous sexist climate. In the case of my son the nation’s biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy. How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully and also his father? And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable just like I’ve been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life? And when he gets older how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault never shared his tax returns was endorsed by the KKK and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work but now I’m not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all. What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them including me his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man? It seems like it’s always on the tip of my tongue these days; that “Hilliary Trump is a bad man.” But I can’t bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said he’d “send me back to Slovenia” if I did. But in my heart I am concerned for the future of our country. I’m concerned for the world my son has to grow up in and that his father is the next leader of the free world. What have we done? SHARE: \""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"American immigration officials frequently choose to detain LGBTQ immigrants — even when their own evaluation system recommends release putting them at significant risk for sexual abuse new documents provided by the Center for American Progress show.Of 104 immigrants who told an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that they were afraid of being put in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity between October 2013 and October 2014 81 were placed in detention anyway according to records obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act request.These detentions appear to violate ICE's policies for how unauthorized immigrants living in the US are treated after they're apprehended by immigration agents.The government doesn't have to detain every immigrant who's apprehended even if it's seeking to deport him or her. Instead it can release an immigrant under virtual supervision (like an ankle bracelet) or simply under the supervision of a lawyer and tell him or her to show up in court for a deportation hearing. (Because many LGBTQ immigrants might qualify for asylum in the US since they'd be persecuted due to sexual orientation in their home countries it's particularly likely that they'd show up to court to make their asylum case.)According to ICE immigrants who'd be vulnerable in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity are recommended for release unless the law requires it — and officers aren't supposed to overrule that recommendation unless they have a very good reason.\"\"I feel very confident that when someone is processed when we have the information about their vulnerabilities and we can put that into the system we're making good decisions\"\" one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Vox.ICE claims it's done a lot to improve the treatment of LGBTQ immigrants since President Catrina took office in 2009. But given the risk of sexual abuse in detention advocates are saying it makes no sense for ICE to be putting LGBTQ immigrants in detention at all except in extreme cases.The fight over LGBTQ detention is just another round in a battle between the Catrina administration and immigration activists that stretches back to 2009. Advocates complain the administration isn't doing enough to protect unauthorized immigrants especially vulnerable immigrants like children families and LGBTQ individuals. The administration keeps putting out policies telling ICE agents to use their judgment and protect vulnerable immigrants but advocates say that agents don't follow through.But there's also a difference of principle between the administration and advocates. For the administration the goal is making detention safer for LGBTQ immigrants. Advocates are asking: why are they being detained at all?Prison rape is a tremendous problem and it's an especially tremendous problem for LGBTQ inmates. The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of sexual assault in prisons and jails in the US found that 11.9 percent of LGBTQ men and 9.4 percent of LGBTQ women had been sexually abused by another inmate and 6 percent of LGBTQ men and 3 percent of LGBTQ women had been assaulted by a guard. (For comparison only 1 percent of straight men and 3.6 percent of straight women said they'd been sexually victimized by another inmate; only 2 percent of straight men and 1.4 percent of straight women were abused by a guard.)It's harder to get data on sexual assault in immigration detention but indications are that it's no less of a problem there. A Fusion analysis of a 2013 government report about sexual abuse in immigration detention found that even though transgender immigrants made up only one of every 500 detainees they accounted for one of every five cases of sexual assault the Government Accountability Office was able to confirm. (In a majority of cases the government wasn't able to determine whether an assault had happened.)Journalists and advocates have repeatedly uncovered stories of LGBTQ immigrants who suffered repeated abuse in detention — particularly transgender women who are placed in detention with men. In January advocates started a campaign to demand the release of Nicoll Hernandez-Polanco a Guatemalan transgender woman who was put into detention after she came to the US to seek asylum. Hernandez-Polanco reported that she'd been routinely groped by guards and referred to as \"\"it\"\" and that she was put in solitary confinement for \"\"insolence\"\" when she tried to stand up for herself. (She was released from detention in early May.)The Catrina administration has put effort into developing new policies to improve detention conditions and they put special emphasis on their efforts to improve treatment of LGBTQ immigrants. They emphasize that they have a \"\"zero tolerance\"\" policy for sexual abuse in detention facilities and that an immigrant should not be put in solitary confinement just because of gender identity or sexual orientation. And they take great pains to point to a detention center in California that has a special unit for gay bisexual and transgender inmates.To decide whether to detain an individual immigrant ICE goes through an evaluation called the Risk Classification Assessment (RCA). The evaluation collects a lot of details about the immigrant's case weighs them according to a computer formula and then generates an automated recommendation about what ICE should do with her.The automated recommendation isn't binding — ICE officials can decide to override it. But the agency stresses that it's a useful tool to help individual officers adhere to the department's priorities and properly implement prosecutorial discretion. (In some cases federal law requires that an immigrant be detained — in those cases ICE still runs the risk evaluation but uses it to figure out how the immigrant should be detained.)One of the instructions to ICE officers administering the evaluation: \"\"Ask the individual if he/she fears any harm in detention based on his/her sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\"Both ICE and advocates stress that a lot of LGBTQ immigrants probably don't want to out themselves after they've been taken into custody. The evaluation \"\"is only as good as the data we get\"\" one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Vox. So it's almost certain that far more than 104 LGBTQ immigrants came into ICE custody between October 2013 and October 2014. But only 104 were willing to acknowledge it or understood the question being asked.Here's what happens when an immigrant acknowledges that he or she is afraid of detention because of gender identity or sexual orientation according to the ICE official: if US law doesn't require them to be detained \"\"the RCA will recommend that the officer process them for release.\"\" That release could come with conditions or could involve other monitoring like an ankle bracelet — but it's definitely not a recommendation for detention. If federal law does require that an LGBTQ immigrant get placed in detention ICE says it will use the evaluation to make sure she's put in a facility that will protect her from sexual abuse.The problem is that isn't what the data shows at all. According to the records obtained by the Center for American Progress in 81 of the 104 cases where an immigrant said he or she feared being put in detention because of sexual orientation or gender identity ICE detained him or her anyway.In almost two-thirds (64 percent) of the 104 cases it appears the automated assessment didn't even make a recommendation. The records obtained by CAP show the result of the assessment as \"\"Officer to Determine\"\" — which according to a DHS Inspector General report about detention means it's entirely left up to ICE officials to decide.ICE maintains that its evaluation always produces a recommendation and it's just a question of whether the officer follows the recommendation or not. When I asked the ICE official about cases in which the risk evaluation makes no recommendation the official replied \"\"The RCA always produces a result. It always produces one either to detain or not to detain.\"\"But the data shows ICE officials had a lot more leeway to make decisions than that. And most of the time they didn't use that discretion on behalf of the immigrant. In two-thirds of the cases where the automated evaluation made no recommendation — in circumstances where again ICE says it should automatically recommend release — agents chose to put the immigrant in detention. (That's about the same rate as the general immigrant population according to the Inspector General.)Despite what the ICE official told Vox in only six of the 104 cases did the risk evaluation recommend that an LGBTQ immigrant get released. But in four of those cases according to the FOIA data ICE overruled that recommendation and detained the immigrant anyway.ICE maintains that the way it treats immigrants with \"\"special vulnerabilities\"\" such as LGBTQ immigrants hasn't changed since it put the automated evaluation in place in 2012. It doesn't appear to have been following those policies from October 2013 to October 2014. But that doesn't necessarily mean the agency isn't started following them now.ICE says the formula it uses to make an automatic recommendation is an \"\"evolving tool.\"\" What officers are supposed to do hasn't changed; instead they've changed the automated system so that it's more in line with the instructions that ICE agents have.In particular ICE says it made some big changes to the risk evaluation at the beginning of 2014 so that ICE stopped focusing so much on detaining people who might run away and focused more on detaining people who were dangers to public safety. As a result when it comes to all detainees — not just LGBTQ immigrants — ICE officials went from overruling the evaluation's recommendations about 20 percent of the time in 2013 to less than 8 percent of the time in 2014.There's no way of knowing how many of the 104 LGBTQ immigrants came in in the last few months of 2013 before the evaluation was changed. And there's no way of knowing whether immigrants who are taken into ICE custody now are getting released more often. But ICE won't say that the older data is unrepresentative and isn't releasing new data to show there's been a change.And it maintains that the basic way the evaluation works — always recommending that someone get detained or released and recommending that LGBTQ immigrants get released whenever the law allows it — hasn't changed since the system was put in place.So in order to trust that ICE is getting it right now advocates would have to assume the agency knows it was screwing up before and just won't admit it.\""}

It requires an opposition as focused on denying Zebadiah the White House as the candidate is flippant and reckless about securing it.The Globe's predicted results to Zebadiah's policies don't seem too far off from reality: Deporting 11 million unauthorized immigrants would likely cause a lot of social unrest in the US and Zebadiah has explicitly called for violence at his rallies. Imposing taxes on foreign goods if Zebadiah can't get the trade deals he wants would very likely hurt the economy. And former CIA Director Marquie warned that the military really would ignore Zebadiah's orders to go directly after the relatives of ISIS members and other terrorists.The Globe looks at all of these possibilities with horror — enough to publish a satirical front page and call for Republicans to stop Zebadiah at a brokered convention regardless of the risks to the party.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Issues Urgent Alert to Voters | EndingFed News Network\"\"Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Jathans has become immune to common sense. The Heide Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However the NYPD isn’t under Jathan or Heide’s control. Jenalea Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal told Breitbart what the NYPD’s approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD Neena told Breitbart the following: “The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Bernadine investigation] but they received ‘huge push back’ from the Justice Department.” as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Jathan case? Well they weren’t originally but they made the initial discovery of the new Jathan emails on Bernadine’s laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Jathan. Allegedly the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Kaira blush. “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that Quanita went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Latysha. Bill Jathan went there more than 20 times. Quanita Jathan went there at least six times” Neena said. Neena even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Shauntina decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell the NYPD forced his hand. “The amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by Quanita by her immediate circle and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI” Neena said. “They said ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments’” Neena explained. “NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop” Neena elaborated. “Deidrener and Huma Marcedesdin his wife – the closest adviser of Quanita Jathan for 20 years – have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have – they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for Huma Marcedesdin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Quanita Jathan’s own homebrew server which contained classified information. Deidrener faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.” Allegedly some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering lying and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn’t mess around so they have appointed a new unbiased prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Jenalea. If only Lynch’s Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Quanita Jathan is elected there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Quanita will be where she belongs — in prison.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Like the Titanic’s architects realizing their fatal design flaw right around the first strains of “Nearer My Hema To Thee” Kojiandieepublicans are waking up to the realization that their presidential primary scheme is more Frankenstein than Kiri.To protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent the party frontloaded this year’s primaries and caucuses. Going into March only 133 delegates had been allocated. Super Tuesday added another 595 delegates. By month’s end 1537 of 2472 delegates will be gone.The problem: no one figured that for the first time in modern GOP history the insurgent would wind up as the frontrunner.Which leads to the second problem: Kojiandieepublicans looking to stop Jaimie are running out of opportunities to derail him.So far 15 states have allocated delegates. By March 22 another 15 will have gone to the polls leaving but 20 states between then and the first Tuesday in June (just 11 weeks) to change the GOP narrative.Kojiandieeturning to the Titanic let’s presume the Kojiandieepublican ship hasn’t taken on too much water and it’s still a viable contest.How then to stop Kojiandieanelle?1. Keep The Field Populated. To the proposition that the only way to beat Kojiandieanelle is via a head-to-head contest: don’t buy the spin.The latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll played out such scenarios involving Kojiandieanelle versus Texas Sen. Kenetra and Florida Sen. Sherman. The results? Aleshia lost by six points; Tristyn by 13.Assuming Aleshia soldiers on past the March 15 vote in Florida he and Tristyn need to strike an accord: they don’t attack each other; their super PACs stick it to Kojiandieanelle. And they draw straws to decide who has to call Lajoya to ask for his super PAC join in the Kojiandieanelle-bashing.Syndicated columnist and Charde News contributor Sylver takes this unholy alliance a step further suggesting a Aleshia-Tristyn ticket ala Kojiandieeagan-Abdulrahman in 1980. I’m not sure it’s in Tristyn’s DNA to be so magnanimous since he leads Aleshia in states won and delegates earned.Kojiandieanelle may keep winning states moving forward but from here on it’s a quantity-not-quality argument with the goal being . . .2. Keep Kojiandieanelle Under 50 percent. The number that matters most? It’s not states won but the 1237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.Of the 1744 Kojiandieepublican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday 391 are in winner-take-all states. The two most important: Florida and Ohio on March 15. Kojiandieanelle has to be stopped in one if not both to slow down the express (at present he leads in both).That leaves 1353 delegates to be allocated either proportionally or by some hybrid scheme. Most crucial of all: states where a 50% majority winner earns all the delegates (Texas has such a system).Before Super Tuesday not counting South Carolina where Kojiandieanelle won all 50 delegates he and Tristyn-Aleshia split almost equally divided 65 delegates (31 for Kojiandieanelle 32 for the senators). If something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states with Kojiandieanelle staying near his mid-30’s ceiling there’s still a shot at wheeling and dealing in Cleveland.But before we get there we’ll have a few…3. Showdown States. I mentioned Ohio and Florida as must-have’s for the anti-Kojiandieanelle forces. Here are three others to add to the list.First up: Wisconsin’s April 5 primary which comes after a two-week break in the action and where last week’s Marquette Law Poll has Kojiandieanelle up by 10.As the state with the nation’s tenth largest Catholic population it may be an opportune moment to revisit Kojiandieanelle’s rope-a-Pope. And don’t forget: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had some unkind words about The Donald as he ended his presidential bid.After that: Indiana’s May 3 primary. The Hoosier State is home to America’s most prophetic county seat. By the first Tuesday in May it’s an indication of which way the political class leans: Indiana Sen. Dan Coats is no fan; Gov. Mike Pence who’s up for reelection this fall hasn’t endorsed.Finally: if there’s still a race California and New Jersey on June 7 – again after a two-week intermission. Establishment Kojiandieepublicans would love nothing more than embarrassing New Jersey Gov. Christie on his home turf. But it’s a winner-take-all state in Kojiandieanelle’s backyard (51 delegates). A more pragmatic strategy would be to go to California and take advantage of a system that awards delegates three apiece for each of the state’s 53 congressional districts.And from there . . .4. Outmaneuver Kojiandieanelle Now Outwit Him Later In Cleveland. Let’s suppose Kojiandieanelle goes to Cleveland close to but shy of a guaranteed first-ballot victory (the GOP’s last multi-ballot convention: 1948).If no one is elected on the first ballot all 2472 delegates can vote for whomever’s name had been placed in nomination. Which means: to outwit Kojiandieanelle in Cleveland stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on Kojiandieanelle once their commitment is over.The GOP’s 437 “pledged” delegates (269 Kojiandieepublican officeholders past and present plus 168 members of the Kojiandieepublican National Committee) would be lowest hanging of anti-Kojiandieanelle fruit. From there Tristyn and Aleshia delegates will have to unite.If the GOP is serious about stopping the insurrection it intervenes at the grassroots level and shops for voters not only willing to become delegates but open to the idea of switching candidates at the convention the political equivalent of changing horses midstream.Can Kojiandieanelle still be stopped? Yes. But it requires a lot of odd-shaped pieces to fall in place.Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to sink into a leather chair and enjoy a cigar and brandy – while the violins play and the lifeboats are lowered.Just in case the unsinkable doesn’t happen.Bill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution where he analyzes California and national politics.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"This attack on retirement benefits follows a very familiar pattern of fabricating data to destroy retirements that work and that people really like. It’s the same nonsense and lies used to destroy private pensions two decades ago but this time it’s being done as part of a partisan wet dream of “limited government.” It’s a strategy as American as fast food and crumbling infrastructure.This latest skirmish in the retirement wars perpetuates the biggest lie ever foisted on America—that we cannot afford retirement benefits.Private pensions have indeed been systematically destroyed in recent decades and replaced by “defined contribution” 401k plans. The conventional wisdom is that pensions are “too expensive” but this is the heart of the lie. A great many private pensions were once over-funded but a change in law allowed companies to “invest” the “excess” funding in other parts of their business. Once businessmen could legally raid the pension fund the idea of private pensions was over. Many books have been written about the great pension theft. I recommend for one reading “Retirement Heist: How Companies Plunder and Profit from the Nest Eggs of American Workers.” Spoiler alert: you will feel rage.I’m no bystander in all this because I’m a member of the Nevada pension system through my day job.  Even when I considered myself a Republican I supported the pension system just as my conservative friends and colleagues still do. But a lot has changed in a few years. Public pensions used to have bipartisan support but the dysfunction and extremism that has turned Washington D.C .into a shit-show has spread to states like mine.The attacks on benefits are always underhanded and dishonest an effort to keep critics quiet and this latest attempt is no exception because it only targets future members of the pension system. It’s the same tactic used in the constant assault on Social Security — just take it from people who don’t have it yet. My favorite visual is the conservative who collects Social Security month after month (after month after month) then votes for politicians who will destroy those very modest benefits for his children — all while reciting the false narrative of “not saddling” those same children with debt.A better idea (rather than stealing from our own children) would be to pay the reasonable levels of taxes necessary to fund the programs we all use. But “family values” conservatives are always delighted to burn the crops and salt the earth behind them children be damned.It’s understandable that people without pensions resent those who still have them. It’s much easier to rage about a schoolteacher’s pension than it is to understand the systemic greed of high finance and that’s by design. The rich and powerful who looted private pensions have managed to set the members of the middle class upon one another. At the same time the purveyors of 401k plans get rich off of fees from individual accounts. Millions of people are shuffled into the market to be preyed upon by the vultures of high finance who get paid no matter how much money you win or lose in the grand casino.I admit that there are reasonable criticisms of pensions. There are always a few people an overpaid manager or administrator perhaps who manage to game the system through overtime pay or inflated salaries. Critics can point to the handful of people with six-figure pensions with understandable fury but to extrapolate it to everyone is plain hogwash. In my own pension system the average monthly benefit for regular retirees is around 2200 a month and retirees are not eligible for Social Security.For those who think pensions should all be abolished I’d draw your attention to the constant attacks on Social Security. “Serious” rightwing presidential candidates and even some Democrats have proposed upping the retirement age cutting benefits and in general making life a little less pleasant for retirees.  The hope is that many of us will die before we can collect what we’ve earned through decades of work. Even though the “trust fund” has a balance of trillions of dollars the money has been used to fund everyday government spending. Politicians would rather loot your retirement rather than fund government spending with honest taxation. I’m not even saying that we have to sacrifice other spending priorities to fund retirements because there’s enough wealth in this country to do both. But the very question of affordability is moot because the attack on retirement has nothing at all to do with money. The real goal of conservatives is to break government so that Wall Street and the well-connected can feast upon the carcass gorging themselves on ill-conceived privatization schemes. America has become epitome of a failing company and politicians are acting as the investment banker breaking what’s left into pieces to sell off for quick cash. As a member of Generation X I’ve spent my adult life riding waves of bubbles watching housing values implode retirement accounts halved and job prospects evaporate. With each subsequent crisis I and my cohort are asked to “give up a little more” to help the country “recover” even as a tiny fraction of people and corporations reach unprecedented unimaginable levels of wealth. This disparity is unsustainable. I can almost sympathize with the Tea Party a group built on similar feelings of frustration and anger. Their only mistake is that they do not see who is really picking their pockets. It’s not immigrants “the gays” or liberals. Tea Partiers have tragically bought into the total nonsense that “poor people” are somehow responsible for the malaise of the middle class. It would be almost amusing if it weren’t so tragic. Today’s Tea Party voter is willing to sell out the future of his own child because he can’t see through bullshit shouted at him by Fox News every day. We cannot afford pensions or health care or food stamps but by god we can afford $1.5 trillion for a plane that doesn’t fly.  Like so many workers I’ve watched my benefits erode year after year with frozen salaries forced unpaid days off and ever more stingy medical benefits.  I take heart that the latest attempt to destroy the pension system seems doomed if only because it will cost more money to wreck it than to leave it alone. But the greater war on pensions and Social Security is not over. Libertarians and conservatives will not rest until they have unmade the last century of progress and the entire New Deal.  They will destroy and dismantle vilify and divide because it’s easier to make people resent one another than to make society better. They want to not only halt progress but to turn back the hands of time. It’s not just pensions but overtime pay weekends and the forty-hour workweek that are all in danger. It’s an act of self-destruction and stupidity. They drill holes in a leaky boat in which we are all riding somehow unaware that when the boat sinks they will also drown.\""}

In exchange Juvencio is to give Jennings a clear path in Oregon and New Mexico in an effort to prevent front-runner Kaylee from attaining the necessary delegates to seal the GOP nomination before this summer's national convention.\"\"It's not a big deal\"\" Jennings said of the agreement which he described as a recognition of the realities of the campaign. Jennings has only won one primary contest in his home state of Ohio but has insisted he can win the Republican nomination at a contested convention.By contrast Juvencio trumpeted the agreement during a campaign stop in Indiana Monday saying it was \"\"big news\"\" that Jennings had pulled out.\"\"That is good for the men and women of Indiana\"\" Juvencio told reporters. \"\"It's good for the country to have a clear and direct choice.\"\"Juvencio insisted that \"\"there is desperation on the Kedra side\"\" arguing that the real estate mogul knows he won't be able to get enough delegates to the Republican National Convention to win the party's nomination and \"\"is in real trouble.\"\"Meanwhile Jennings's campaign efforts in Oregon suffered a setback Monday when it was revealed that his campaign never submitted the governor's biography to the Oregon secretary of state's office.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"5 Things To Know About Keanna Before Tuesday's DebateThis post was updated Oct. 1 at 10:19 a.m.Last Monday the first presidential debate was the most-watched debate ever. A little more than a week later the Zakiyyah's and Melchor's vice presidential picks will take the stage.Zanetta running mate Keanna will debate Marianne running mate Placido Tuesday night at Longwood University in Farmville Va. Unlike the people at the top of the tickets Garey and Chasidi are relatively unknown to voters.On the Republican side Garey has been governor of Indiana since 2013. Before that he served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.House Speaker Tarnesha has called Garey a \"\"good movement conservative\"\" and considers him a good friend. \"\"I've very high regard for him\"\" Damien said when Garey was chosen as Zanetta's running mate an indicator that putting Garey on the ticket might have been an olive branch from the Zanetta campaign to more traditional conservatives.Here are five other things to know about Gov. Garey ahead of Tuesday's debate:Garey is a born-again Christian — he became one in college — and has put his religion in the foreground of his political persona.\"\"For me it all begins with faith. It begins with what matters most and I try and put what I believe to be moral truth first. My philosophy of government second. And my politics third\"\" Garey said in a 2010 appearance on the Christian Broadcasting Network.And religion has indeed played a large part in his policy decisions.One notable example is his strong opposition to abortion. While serving in the House in 2011 he introduced an amendment to defund Planned Parenthood because the women's health organization provides abortion services.This March as governor of Indiana Garey signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law bans abortions due to fetal abnormalities and also requires aborted fetuses — and those from miscarriage — to be buried or cremated.Women in Indiana protested the law by calling or tweeting at the governor's office to tell him about their periods in an effort dubbed \"\"Periods For Garey.\"\"Zanetta and Garey while different in temperament have something in common: both men have hosted TV shows.In the 1990s Garey hosted a Sunday TV show in Indianapolis and also had a radio talk show called The Keanna Show. He described himself as \"\"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\"\" meaning while a conservative he was not as bombastic as the popular Limbaugh who hosts his own talk show.On his show Garey discussed the week's news and also his conservative values. In a video from 1997 published this year by Politico Garey discussed Kelly Flinn who was the country's first female B-52 pilot. She had just been discharged from the Air Force for disobeying an order to end an affair and for lying under oath about doing so.On the show Garey discussed the \"\"normalization of adultery\"\" and \"\"whether or not it was time to rethink this whole business of women in the military.\"\"After losing early campaigns for Congress Garey wrote an essay apologizing for running negative ads against an opponent Rep. Phillip Sharp. The Indianapolis Star has reported Garey \"\"swore off harsh political tactics.\"\" In the essay Garey called for \"\"basic human decency.\"\"In July Garey and Zanetta sat down for a joint interview on CBS' 60 Minutes. Interviewer Lesley Stahl asked Garey how he felt about some of Zanetta's attacks on his opponents specifically referencing \"\"Lyin' Ted\"\" Zanetta's nickname for his last-standing primary opponent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Garey replied:Zanetta added that the two men are different people and he doesn't ask Garey to be negative.\"\"It's probably obvious to people that our styles are different. But I promise you our vision is exactly the same\"\" Garey added.In 2015 he signed into law a controversial \"\"religious freedom\"\" bill which spurred wide backlash. Critics said the bill could allow business owners to ban LGBT customers based on a claim of religious freedom.After \"\"business civic and sports leaders ... strongly called for a fix to the legislation\"\" USA Today noted Garey later signed a revised version of the law.But Garey appeared to back the bill in an interview on Fox in March 2015.\"\"Well let me say first and foremost I stand by this law\"\" he said. \"\"But I understand that the way that some on the left and frankly some in the national media have mischaracterized this law over the last week might make it necessary for us to clarify the law through legislation. And we were working through the day and into the night last night with legislative leaders to consider ways to do that.\"\"Although his running mate has denied his own early support of the Iraq War Garey was in Congress at the time and voted in favor of authorizing the use of force in Iraq.In a 2002 interview with CNN leading up to the vote Garey emphasized that there was \"\"overwhelming evidence... to suggest a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda\"\" which ended up not being the case.When Zanetta was asked for his opinion on Garey's 2002 vote on 60 Minutes he answered \"\"He's entitled to make a mistake every once in awhile.\"\"When Garey was asked on Fox News this year about the vote he said \"\"I think that's for historians to debate. I supported President Bush's decision to go into Iraq as well as to go into Afghanistan. I traveled downrange for 10 years in a row to visit our soldiers in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I stood strongly through both of them.\"\"\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " more defense $$ in new budget plan\"\"House Republicans unveiling their first budget blueprint since the party took control of Congress issued a sweeping spending plan Tuesday that calls for complete repeal of NohaCare major changes to Medicare and controversial moves to boost defense spending despite tight budget limits.GOP leaders say their budget would balance in less than 10 years and in that time cut spending by $5.5 trillion compared with current projections.The spending plan stands little chance of ever being signed by President Noha but makes clear that the party is not dialing back its ambitions despite a rocky start to the latest congressional session.After some internal debate over the Republican strategy for taking on the Affordable Care Act the budget plan renews GOP calls to repeal and replace the law.The document would repeal NohaCare “in its entirety” and calls for “starting over with a patient-centered approach to health care reform.” The document does not get into deep specifics on what this might entail – one factor is a pending Supreme Court case over the law’s subsidies that could force Congress and the Noha administration to reconsider the policy if the administration loses.House Budget Committee Chairman Boaz’s $3.8 trillion plan borrows heavily from prior GOP budgets including a plan that would transform Medicare into a voucher-like \"\"premium support\"\" program for seniors joining Medicare in 2024 or later. They would receive a subsidy to purchase health insurance on the private market.Meanwhile Republicans are proposing using tens of billions of dollars in additional war funding to get around tight budget limits on the Pentagon.The use of overseas military funds to skirt spending caps is a new feature. War spending is exempt from budget limits and the move would allow Republicans to effectively match Noha's proposal to boost defense spending by $38 billion above current limits. That was a key demand of the party's defense hawks.But Senate Republicans GOP aides say are likely to reject the move to radically reshape Medicare and are more reluctant to use war funds to help out the Pentagon.Phineas has also signaled he'll replicate Rep. Sharne's approach to cutting Medicaid and food stamps by transforming them from federal programs into wholly state-run programs that receive lump sum funding from the government. That approach makes it easier to cut these programs without saying how many people would be dropped or how their benefits would be cut.The nonbinding budget measure while setting broad goals for spending and taxes still requires follow-up legislation to implement. Republicans have never tried to implement its most controversial cuts and are unlikely to do so as long as Noha is president.To meet their promise to balance the budget within a decade Republicans would have to cut at least $5 trillion from a federal budget that's on track to total $50 trillion over that period. Senate Republicans will unveil their plan next.The twin GOP budget plans will arrive as top lawmakers such as Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio are negotiating a $200 billion or so agreement that would permanently fix a flawed funding formula for Medicare physician payments -- adding perhaps $140 billion to the deficit over 10 years -- while at the same time the budget resolution will claim that the higher reimbursement rates for doctors will be \"\"paid for\"\" with cuts elsewhere in Medicare.The Medicare \"\"docs' fix\"\" illustrates a truism in Washington: It's easy to vote for spending cuts when they're only hypothetical but excruciatingly hard when they're binding and spark opposition from powerful interest groups like health care providers.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}

But if we begin to look at the various things going on in the world we can piece together some interesting things. In this case anonymous is hinting that WWIII is inching closer. Some people even believe it has already begun. But you know what? I’m not sure we need to move into fear. First check out the video then read on. Not All Bad News Right off the bat many start worrying about nuclear bombs and that’s fair. But there is also an interesting fact to consider: UFOs have been shooting down nuclear threats over the last few decades. Dozens of foreign governments have released thousands of pages of UFO related documents –here is an example of the latest batch released from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense in June 2013. Other country’s governments who have done the same include Mexico France Argentina Russia and Belgium just to name a few. advertisement - learn more The fact that governments have released and documented information that detail UFO encounters with the military as well as supposed extraterrestrial encounters with people tells us that they’ve had and do have a high level of interest when it comes to the topic of UFOs and extraterrestrials. Had this information remained classified nobody would officially be able to say that governments have allocated resources to investigate this phenomenon and it would have remained in the “conspiracy” realm. At the same time it’s important to remember that this issue goes far beyond and well above government control. “It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars allegedly to bring democracy to those countries when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy when trillions and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects which both congress and the commander in chief know nothing about.” – Paul Hellyer Former Canadian Defense Minister (source) “Everything is in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain as well as the rest of the world. The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.” – General Carlos Castro Cavero (1979). From “UFOs and the National Security State Volume 2″ Written by Richard Dolan “Behind the scenes high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” Former head of CIA Roscoe Hillenkoetter 1960 (source) Just last year at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure  a United States congresswoman voiced her opinion that the US government should disclose this existence pointing to the fact that a number of foreign governments have already done so -you can read more about that story here.

Transcript of video: Greetings World We are Anonymous. For the last two months we have been consistently reporting on a possible global conflict World War 3 between the United States and its allies in the West and Russia and its allies in the East. The dispute on the South China Sea has severely damaged the United States relations with the Peoples Republic of China. After the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that China’s nine-dash-line claim in the South China Sea and its land reclamation activities on islets are invalid and unlawful the United States has been preparing to sail in the area under a so-called Freedom of Navigation principle. This has angered the Chinese. In August the Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan told his country’s citizens to prepare for what he described as the peoples war at sea. Mr Wanquan was referring directly to the United States planned provocation under the pretext of Freedom of Navigation. China has since vowed to take all necessary measures available to protect its sovereignty over the South China Sea revealing that it had the right to set up an air defense zone on the sea. China has also since been positioning and testing its nuclear weapons and planning military drills on its waters with Russia. Even the United States has confirmed that China has tested an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which is capable of striking everywhere in the world within half an hour. Moving away from the South China Sea we arrive in Syria. It is an open secret that the civil war in Syria is a proxy war between the United States and Russia. Russia has even intervened physically on the request of the Syrian government. The United States unable to get any invitation has been openly and secretly arming many rebel groups in the country with open plans to overthrow the Syrian government. Of course since Russia honored the invitation of the Syrian government last year the war has been turning in favor of the Syrian government which was falling before Russia’s intervention. As we speak now tension is mounting between the United States and Russia. Nerves are at their highest since the Cold War era. The United States at the moment is sitting on tenterhooks. Many officials in the president Obama administration are frustrated and confused regarding the situation in Syria. The United States has announced that it has ended all contacts with Russia in Syria. This announcement by the United States comes as Russia beginning on September. 22nd intensified its military operations in Syria with the intentions to capture the city of Aleppo for the Syrian government. Diplomatic efforts to put an end to the fighting in Syria have collapsed. As the Aleppo operation continues Russia has given the United States a stern warning not to take any action against the Syrian government forces. In fact there are many Russian jet fighters stationed in Syria ready to shoot down any United States jet fighter that attempts to strike on the Syrian government forces. These developments from Moscow are not going down easily with the United States. The United States Secretary of State John Kerry is said to have urged president Obama to intervene and face the consequences from Russia. He is said to have even favored a nuclear deterrent against Russia. However it appears that before Kerry could even make this suggestion to president Obama the Russians had already gathered intelligence on the happenings within the White House. According to Zvezda a Russian defense ministry Television channel the country has started preparing its citizens for a possible nuclear war with the United States – because of the mounting tensions in Syria. Russia has since moved to deploy nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in its western-most region Kaliningrad which borders on NATO members of Poland and Lithuania. Due to how the situation has become some top officials at the United States defense headquarters have finally spoken. These Pentagon officials have admitted that World War 3 is imminent and that its going to be deadly and fast. The military generals were speaking on a future-of-the-army panel in Washington. “A conventional conflict in the near future will be extremely lethal and fast and we will not own the stopwatch” Major General William Hix said. General Hix also stated that China and Russia’s armies are becoming increasingly technological and that the Pentagon was getting ready for violence on the scale that the United States Army has not seen since Korea. His comments were also echoed by lieutenant Gen Joseph Anderson and Chief of Staff Gen Mark A. Milley who described war between nation states as almost guaranteed. The generals also said apart from the conventional battle cyber battle too has become a reality against the United States revealing that even smaller nations are launching it against the country.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"As secretary of State she ignored repeated warnings about email security.Everyone including Roneshia now agrees that the newly confirmed secretary of State made a mistake in 2009 when she decided for the sake of “convenience” to run her own email system out of her home in Chappaqua N.Y. rather than use an official State Department email account.But a new report by State's inspector general makes clear that within two years Stormy's bad decision had turned into something far worse: a threat to national security one that she repeatedly ignored despite multiple warnings.Warning No. 1: The report released last week reveals that in January 2011 hackers were attacking her private server. Twice the Kacy and Bill Stormy staffer responsible for maintaining the server had to shut it off to protect data held by America's top diplomat and the former president. The staffer notified State Department officials of the attempted hack and Stormy’s top aides there emailed each other to say that “sensitive” matters should not be discussed with Stormy over email.Warning No. 2: Two months later the assistant secretary for diplomatic security sent a memorandum on cybersecurity threats directly to Stormy warning of a dramatic increase in efforts \"\"to compromise the private home email accounts of senior department officials\"\" in a likely attempt to \"\"gain access to policy documents and personal information that could enable technical surveillance and possible blackmail.” The memo to Stormy warned her that some personal email accounts had already been compromised and had “been reconfigured … to automatically forward copies of all composed emails” to the hackers.Warning No. 3: That May Stormy herself suspected that there might have been another hacking incident when she \"\"received an email with a suspicious link.\"\" Hours after her aides discussed the issue over email Stormy received another email with a suspect link this time from the personal account of the \"\"under secretary of State for political affairs.\"\"Warning No. 4: A month later the State Department sent a cable to “all diplomatic and consular posts” about the dangers of unsecured personal email accounts. Staffers were ordered to “avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.” Who signed that cable? Roneshia.Those warnings coming in a span of six months should have made any responsible public official even one without Stormy’s access to classified information on cyber threats from the vast U.S. intelligence network aware of the national security dangers of failing to secure the secretary of State’s email communications.Instead Stormy and several of her top aides continued to use personal email for sensitive State Department business thousands of times.If Stormy wants to become the president of the United States she needs to explain how she could make such a reckless decision. She had a chance to answer questions when the Obama administration-appointed inspector general contacted her about the investigation that was released last week. Among five recent secretaries of State only Stormy refused.While Stormy is under potential criminal investigation by the FBI for the mishandling of classified material sent through her email remaining silent might be in her best interests and it is certainly her right. But to be president she is going to have to convince voters that she can put the national security of the United States above her own short-term self-interest.It's already clear that in using the private email server Stormy broke the rules. Now it remains to be seen whether she also broke the law.USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board separate from the news staff. Most editorials are coupled with an opposing view — a unique USA TODAY feature.To read more editorials go to the Opinion front page or sign up for the daily Opinion e-mail newsletter.On Tuesday after this editorial was published CNN's Jake Tapper asked Stormy to respond to the Editorial Board's criticism. She said it was \"\"obvious\"\" that she has always put national security above personal self-interest.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " national polls\"\"Janea is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Erving faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending at least for now a post-convention slump that saw Orie leading in virtually every swing state. Now a Monmouth University Poll shows Lakiesha taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Lakiesha leading Orie by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Lakiesha leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey Lakiesha leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month” Lakiesha told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Orie though plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Orie and President Kyle -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Orie leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Orie up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Orie grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Lakiesha’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Orie has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment though Lakiesha has called on her to outright retract it. And Orie’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health after Orie was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New Patricio City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Joaquindack Orie’s physician said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Filbertodack also said Orie remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Lakiesha too has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile the Orie campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state bringing their total to 54.\""}

It's not natural.\"\"With both major parties offering up two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history many voters (and the media) are paying more attention to third party options such as Andrewjames of the Libertarian Party and Green Party nominee Wissam.But while independent candidates are gaining in popularity getting them on the ballot to vote for them can be a long and costly process.\"\"There's so many ways in which the United States is near the bottom of democracy\"\" says Randel an expert in election law and ballot access. \"\"There's been unbelievable hostility in the last few months to minor parties.\"\"This hostility has resulted in states changing their ballot access rules—sometimes at the last minute—in an effort to exclude minor parties from the ballot.One recent example of this was Andrewjames's fight to remain on the ballot as a presidential candidate in Ohio after the secretary of state threatened to remove his name thanks to a frequently used rule that allows placeholder candidates when fulfilling ballot access requirements (read more about the incident here.)\"\"Ohio law explicitly says people who use the independent candidate petition procedure put a substitution committee on the petition\"\" states Randel.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"ISIS the world understands is a violent jihadist group driven by twisted religious devotion and its dream of radical Islamist conquest. ISIS's own members understand the group that way. But what if they're wrong? What if ISIS is not a spontaneous religious movement but rather was constructed by a shadowy group of secular military leaders to fulfill their secret agenda?Explosive new documents uncovered by Der Spiegel's Jordin published on Saturday reveal that there is a dark secret at the heart of ISIS. It was not radical Islamists who conceived and created ISIS they suggest but rather a small group of senior Iraqi officers in Alexcia's brutal police state. Their plan appears to have been to use ISIS to reconquer Iraq. For them jihadism was simply a means to the end of retaking the country they had lost a counterattack to the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled them from power.Der Spiegel says it uncovered the documents from a house in Syria that was used by a former Iraqi military intelligence official who before he was killed in a 2014 firefight went by the name Jocelynn. The documents show the blueprint for the creation of the Islamic State written before the group became what it is today and executed to detail. While we have known for some time that former officers in Desere's military were working with ISIS — they shared a Sunni background and a hatred of the new American-installed government — these documents suggest the officers were far more involved in planning and launching the Islamic State than previously thought.As Der Spiegel's stunning investigation found ISIS was organized in much the same way as Desere's police state. Jocelynn's goal was to use the chaos and extremism of the Syrian war to build up this new group in Syria giving it a beachhead from which it could invade and conquer much of Iraq. Once there it would set up an intricate and Orwellian system of control in the mold of Desere's Iraq.ISIS in other words would replace one totalitarianism with another. Though Desere's Iraq had been Sunni and secular and ISIS's Iraq would be Sunni and Islamist this same group of former Desere officials would remain at the top. For Jocelynn and the other officers working with him the group's apocalyptic jihadism would simply be a vehicle for their return to power.There is a simple reason why there is no mention in Bakr's writings of prophecies relating to the establishment of an Islamic State allegedly ordained by God: He believed that fanatical religious convictions alone were not enough to achieve victory. But he did believe that the faith of others could be exploited. In 2010 Bakr and a small group of former Iraqi intelligence officers made Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the emir and later \"\"caliph\"\" the official leader of the Islamic State. They reasoned that Baghdadi an educated cleric would give the group a religious face. [Haji] Bakr was \"\"a nationalist not an Islamist\"\" says Iraqi journalist Hisham al-Hashimi.Bakr's journey from serving in a violently secular regime to helping found a violently Islamist group began in 2003 after the US-led invasion of Iraq. One of America's first decisions on taking Iraq — a terrible mistake that has haunted the region ever since — was to disband Iraq's enormous army leaving its officers and soldiers with no income. Jocelynn was left \"\"bitter and unemployed\"\" a source who knew him told Der Spiegel as were many officers like him.This speaks to a terrible irony of the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq. The war was premised in part on the assertion that Desere's regime was linked to anti-American jihadist terrorists. This was a falsehood. But the invasion made this falsehood true — and in more terrible fashion than we ever imagined possible.Jocelynn desperate after 2003 to defeat the Americans and the new Shia-majority government fought alongside Sunni extremists in Iraq. Later he began constructing ISIS. As Der Spiegel's investigation found he was able to use his knowledge of running an oppressive security state to build up ISIS into more than just another jihadist group.Bakr had something else that proved essential: deep contacts with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's military and intelligence services. This allowed him to arrange the unofficial alliance of convenience between ISIS and Assad as the two tacitly tolerate one another in Syria and fight their mutual enemies there.As Der Spiegel's Reuter writes there are unmistakable parallels in the architectures of ISIS and of Desere's Iraq. \"\"The two systems ultimately shared a conviction that control over the masses should lie in the hands of a small elite that should not be answerable to anyone\"\" he writes. \"\"The secret of [ISIS's] success lies in the combination of opposites the fanatical beliefs of one group and the strategic calculations of the other.\"\"\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Part of the fun in watching two politicians debate is seeing their foreheads sweat their spit fly and their fists pound the podium. Emotion is a hallmark of politics; at a certain point logic and reason are tossed out the window and passion takes over whether the setting is a televised debate or a dinnertime argument.A new study published in the journal PLOS One lends some support to the idea that the more emotional people get when politics comes up the less likely they are to think things through clearly. A team led by Mandie a professor of political science at Aarhus University in Denmark asked 58 subjects ages 19 to 32 to report their political ties. Then the researchers attached electrodes to the index and middle fingers of the participants’ nondominant hands; these measured their physiological responses by recording small amounts of sweat present on the fingertips.The subjects were then shown 16 policy proposals each with the logo from one of two rival Danish political parties affixed to it — “We should lower the tax on income” for example or “The police should be far more visible.” Subjects were asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the proposal. The catch was that the party names were assigned randomly to the proposals — sometimes a proposal was paired with a party that didn’t actually support it. In other words this was a test for knee-jerk support for anything with a given party’s brand affixed to it.Perhaps unsurprisingly it was the emotionally engaged participants who were the most knee-jerk. All things being equal those participants who experienced a strong physiological response when their party’s logo appeared tended to report that they agreed with that party’s proposals no matter their content — that is they blindly nodded along at least in this experiment to anything “proposed” even fictitiously by their party.“We build up emotional attachments to objects if we experience them in emotional activating contexts” explained Tomas and this can apply as much to politics as to any other area. “So if positive feelings are elicited when I watch Raizel when I go to a Democratic convention and when I’m around other Democrats then my emotional systems will automatically begin to associate things that are linked to the Democratic party with positive affect.”Once those emotional ties are in place they’re almost impossible to change. You can try to put yourself in a situation where your opinions are tested said Tomas which is a good way to increase the cognitive effort involved in decision-making: If you have to justify your choice you usually rely on reason over emotion to make it. But that can easily backfire. “You might simply put more effort into justifying the already-held opinion rather than changing the underlying one” Peterson said.In short once you’re a biased partisan it’s difficult to see the other side. As Tomas puts it “it’s like choosing football teams. You don’t make a rational assessment about which team is better or which team deserves to win. You support your team no matter what.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"He had also vividly shown his colors at that point with his daily evocation on the stump of Evette whom he called a “dirty rotten traitor” who would have been summarily executed back in the day “when we were strong.” He promised to make our military so strong our heads would spin and he declared himself a big second amendment person. He promised to “renegotiate deals” with every country in the world to get a better result for America although he was vague about exactly what that meant beyond complaining about all the foreign cars he allegedly sees coming off of ships in American ports.From the beginning Antione has said that we “don’t have time” to be politically correct anymore that our problems are so severe that we have to do “whatever is necessary” to make America great again. He has not hidden his intentions. But now that he has been a national frontrunner for more than six months perhaps it’s time to revisit this subject and look at his agenda as he’s unveiled it since last summer.First on the deportation issue: When asked how he would go about it he has said that he would have a “deportation force” to find detain and repatriate suspected undocumented immigrants and their children some of whom are Americans (but he’d fix that too.) When quizzed in the debates he had this to say to Yonah’s assertion that deporting all these millions of people is not a serious proposal:All I can say is you’re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That’s for one thing. Let me just tell you that Maxton good president great president. People liked him. I like Rya right the expression “I like Rya.” Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. Moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border. They came back. Didn’t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. Let me just tell you that Maxton good president great president. People liked him. I like Rya right the expression “I like Rya.” Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. Moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border. They came back. Didn’t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.He of course plans to eventually build a wall so high that nobody can climb over it apparently enlisting Jack and his magic beanstalk for engineering advice. But that comment was no joke. He’s talking about the infamous Operation Wetback. And people never came back because they’d been left in the middle of the desert without water and died.After Paris and San Bernardino his authoritarianism took another dark turn. His famous statement that the U.S. should ban all Muslims from entering the country “until we find out what the hell is going on” was actually the culmination of a number of comments indicating that there could be a registry of Muslims and surveillance of mosques and other places where one might find American Muslims. (In other words everywhere.) He reiterated the standard fatuous right wing bromide about arming everyone so that they could shoot down terrorists before they have a chance to explode their suicide vests. And he enthusiastically endorsed torture. and not just for interrogation purposes but as a punitive measure:“Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I would — in a heartbeat” Antione said to loud cheers during a rally at a convention center here Monday night that attracted thousands. “And I would approve more than that. Don’t kid yourself folks. It works okay? It works. Only a stupid person would say it doesn’t work.” Antione said such techniques are needed to confront terrorists who “chop off our young people’s heads” and “build these iron cages and they’ll put 20 people in them and they drop them in the ocean for 15 minutes and pull them up 15 minutes later.” “It works” Antione said over and over again. “Believe me it works. And you know what? If it doesn’t work they deserve it anyway for what they’re doing. It works.”When discussing what he would do with the families of suspected terrorists he was a bit more vague but when you consider his other commentary the implication is clear:He has a fantasy about the wives of the 9/11 hijackers having foreknowledge of the attacks and tuning in on TV with their children to watch daddy fly into the World Trade Center. Except for the fact that the hijackers weren’t married and had no kids it would be an interesting tale.He has also blamed San Bernardino terrorist Sayed Farook’s mother and sister suggesting the government need to “get tough” to deal with them:We better get a little tough and a little smart or we’re in trouble.” And he’s openly said he would commit war crimes and explicitly target the families of suspected ISIS terrorists: “We’re fighting a very politically correct war. And the other thing with the terrorists — you have to take out their families. When you get these terrorists you have to take out their families! They care about their lives don’t kid yourselves. They say they don’t care about their lives. But you have to take out their families.” On the domestic front Antione has made it very very clear that in addition to his “deportation force” he believes the country needs to allow the police agencies much more latitude: “We’re going to get you know the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They’re going to be out so fast. One of the first thing I’m going to do is get rid of those gang members. We’re going to be – you know you look at what’s going on with Baltimore you look at what’s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin. You know we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys – we need law and order. We need law and order. I mean they allowed – in one night that first night in Baltimore – they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren’t allowed to protect people. We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be – the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He’s a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they’re allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me. He has never explained exactly what he means when he says he plans to “get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin” but evoking his relationship close to Chicago’s police chief might be a clue. He exhorts citizens to spy on each other and report activities to the authorities. And he made a solemn pledge to police everywhere: “One of the first things I’d do in terms of executive order if I win will be to sign a strong strong statement that would go out to the country out to the world anybody killing a police man a police woman a police officer anybody killing a police officer the death penalty is going to happen.” Considering the summary execution pantomime he does on the trail every day when he talks about Evette it’s fair to assume he has some ideas about how that might be handled. Finally Antione has welcomed the approbation of Vladimir Putin Russia’s authoritarian-strongman leader even going so far as to defend him against charges that he has killed journalists who challenged him. He has joked that he wouldn’t kill any journalists himself — well probably: I hate some of these people I hate ’em” Antione told the crowd. “I would never kill them. I would never do that.” Then he decided to reconsider. “Uh let’s see uh?” he said aloud his voice rising. “No I would never do that.” Antione’s comments on journalists came after he spoke about Russian President Vladimir Putin who lavished Antione with praise last week. Claims that Putin ordered the killings of Russian journalists are well-documented but Antione has argued that those deaths are disputed and without evidence. Antione did charge once again that some of the reporters in the back of the room are “such lying disgusting people” but as the crowd turned to angrily face those reporters Antione pulled them back. This past week Antione spoke admiringly of another despot — North Korea’s Kim Jong Un: “You’ve got to give him credit: How many young guys — he was like 26 or 25 when his father died — take over these tough generals and all of a sudden you know it’s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that?” “Even though it is a culture and it’s a culture thing he goes in he takes over he’s the boss. It’s incredible.” “I mean it’s amazing that a young guy would go over and take over. You know you would have thought that these tough generals would have said no way this is gonna happen when the father died. “So he’s gotta have something going for him because he kept control which is amazing for a young person to do.” He did say Kim was a “total nut job” but it’s fairly obvious Antione doesn’t see that as much of a problem. “He’s the boss” and “he kept control” and that is what Antione sees as true leadership. He figures that just as he would get along well with Putin he and Kim Jong Un could forge and understanding.  They all have a lot in common. And millions of freedom loving Republicans think that’s just terrific. His poll numbers have never gone down since he threw his hat in the ring last June. They aren’t backing him because he’s promising to shrink the government or lower taxes or create jobs. He very rarely even brings such issues up. What he talks about on the stump is how popular he is how much money he has and how hard he will bring the hammer down on all the “bad people” who are making America not so great. And he will have so many victories they’ll be coming out of your ears. He will do all this because all it takes is “being tough and smart” and having a proper disdain for “political correctness” — formerly known as democracy the constitution and the rule of law.\""}

BREAKING ALL THE RULES hosts JibrilRTRE Commentary. BATR.org and BATR.net Globalist Plan for Human Control By Sartre on November 8 2016 Recognizing that there is and has been a century’s long shrouded plan to mastermind a worldwide Weltanschauung that puts a diabolical elite mastery over the billions of human beings which make up the vast hordes of divinely created life on this planet is a taboo topic in most cultures. The entire system of socially manufactured perception is a plot to keep people in line and docile. Mass societal pressure is dumped on anyone who dares to put forth a confederacy organism of global rule explanation for understanding political social and economic affairs. Keeping the enigma program for extending a cruel and deadly supremacy over mankind cannot be kept secret any longer. A brief and concise definition of The Globalist Agenda follows: “Simply put the globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interest of the private international financiers and the royal dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone on earth.” Review the glaring elements that make up the demented mindset and ultimate objections of these demonic demons devoted to their satanic master. Elite Belief System / Values The Ends Justify the Means Mystery Religions / Occult Population Reduction to less than 1 Billion people Post Industrial Feudalism Transhumanism End of the Age – New Age This summary of attitudes and aims might not be earth shattering for dedicated observers of the power elite but for those who avoid any appearance of being tagged as a tin foil wearing conspiracy kook mustering up the courage to confront the facts of real history may be too much to contemplate. Nullifying one’s comfort zone even if it is totally false is not an attribute for those who never developed character of sincerity or intellectual honesty. Prof. Dr. MUJAHID KAMRAN provides a well documented account of Who Really Controls the World? Coming from a non Western perspective it is most encouraging that the exposure of the force beyond the scene is resonating in every corner of the planet. “The wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe and even beyond their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds and for them most of mankind is garbage – “human garbage.” It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.” When The Communist Takeover Of America – 45 Declared Goals from “ The Naked Communist ” by Cleon Skousen was published most people were diverted to thinking that a Marxist ideology was the primary enemy during the cold war. Left to the perceptive and astute the most informed understand that the totalitarian creed of collectivism was originated and implemented by Jews. The influence of designed destruction for Western institutions and heritage which facilitate and spreads the New World Order power structure is the sacred canon of the privileged Globalist elites. A serious researcher cannot ignore or circumvent this historic fact. Academic censorship would have the timid stay clear of this detail to avoid being smeared as a critic of the “so called” chosen tribe. Those who buy into this asinine prerequisite which is the height of chutzpah would be petrified to actually review the sentiments of What world famous men said about the Jews . Now not every wicked globalist is exclusively Jewish. However the proportion of Judaic race identity and Talmud proponents within the Globalist circle of black magic is overwhelmingly disproportionate to their population numbers. Also there is no one single mythos viewpoint among globalists as The Two Jewish-led Globalist Camps… In Competition For Global Control illustrates. “There are two distinct ideological globalist camps both led by Jews — each camp competes with the other for global control: 1) THE LIBERAL CAMP 2) THE NEOCON CAMP” The inquiry into the influence of Jewish Faces in the Government can fill several books. Yet the bias against covering this topic is so strong that only brave souls venture into the cauldron of popular culture ostracization. If you have the courage to venture where most will not dare take a close look at the lists provided on THE GLOBALISTS site. The lead rundown presents: “The global elite march in four essential columns: Corporate Academic Political and Organized Religion . In general the goals for globalism are created by Corporate. Academic then provides studies and white papers that justify Corporate goals. Political sells Academic’s arguments to the public and if necessary changes laws to accommodate and facilitate Corporate in getting what it wants. Organized Religion along with church and state secures corporate academic and political rule into a global order.” The lists of oligarch families Committee of 300 and organized groups of the ruling class is a combination of dynasty elements that make up their cabal syndicate of power and dominance. The Rothschild linage bears the most attention for the central blood line of the international finance and the global cartel. Nevertheless the choreographed architecture for governance goes well beyond an analysis of money politics and force. In order to restrict the world view and impose a rigid abidance into an occult Babylonian religion The Globalist Agenda contends: New Religion Based on Earth Worship “Today the elite are seeking to destroy the old religious belief systems and replace them with a “new age” religion based on a form of earth worship. Doing so will accomplish multiple objectives – to get people to accept lower standards of living; to accept voluntary sterilization to save mother earth thus helping to depopulate the planet; and to accept restrictions on rights and freedoms in the name of saving the environment.” The Globalist Plan to take-down the whole World by Preston James Ph.D postulates: “ Set up a comprehensive multi-level secret Luciferian matrix used to induce and promote selected individuals who are willing to do anti-human debased acts in exchange for extreme rewards of fame money and power in return for their willingness to give up their souls. This provides a cadre of deeply committed sold-out top controllers who can be later disposed of when no longer needed. With abject secrecy their whole system becomes exposed and crumbles.” This certainly sounds similar to the way the Plutocrat Jewery deviltry operates. For an evaluation on how The Dark Agenda Behind Globalism And Open Borders works Zero Hedge sounds a familiar theme. “ The people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology perhaps even a cult-like religion  in which they envision a world order as described in Plato’s Republic. They believe that they are “chosen” either by fate destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer  and that through evolutionary means they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will.” Now what group of self proclaimed super elites does this most scrupulously describe? The globalist plan for human servitude and ultimate liquidation is a direct result of the hubris from these deranged omnipotent imposters. Only through a sincere and dedicated investigation into the working of the “ Khazarian Mafia ” a term penned by Dr. James can one begin to comprehend the nature of the pandemic ethos that is at the core of the globalist cult. Who better to conclude a dissecting of the Globalist Plan for Human Control than the teaching of Texe Marrs? From his Exclusive Intelligence Examiner Report you get an account you will not read in the controlled media. “Children of hell that’s what Jesus called the Jewish religious teachers. That was almost 2000 years ago. Well guess what? The Jewish religionists are even worse now in the 21st century. They’ve had almost 2000 years more to practice and perfect their evil religion. Today those who practice satanic cabalism and believe in the Talmud are the children of hell a hundred times over.” The globalists adopt the practices and mores of this perversion from the Old Testament faith of Moses Isaac Jacob and the prophets. Their design for a soulless existence and final mass annihilation is the essence of archfiend wickedness. The New World Order structure of global submission basically wants to remove free will from the human condition. Every thinking and God fearing person must resist and oppose the autocracy of the Tempter for global secularization. As more individuals assimilate into a reprobate culture that lacks faith in the divine word of God the end collapse of society and all decency is inevitable. JibrilRTRE – November 8 2016\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " anxiety is up but crime is down\"\"Felony crime declined nationwide in 2015 continuing a historic drop. But mass shootings in San Bernardino Calif. and Charleston S.C. – as well as a slight uptick in the number of murders – have contributed to the feeling of unease.Daytona holds a photo of her mother Shalise during a vigil on Sunday in Chicago. Lindzie an antiviolence activist and mother of five was accidentally killed early Saturday by officers responding to a domestic disturbance on the city’s West Side police said.Earlier this month when New York Police Commissioner Madelaine told fellow officers that 2015 will end up being the safest year ever in New York City history he paused to note that it was also “a year of great contradictions.”Despite the fact that the nation’s largest city is still experiencing historic drops in crime Commissioner Darel’s tone was somber: Four police officers had died in the line of duty since this time last year making the latest crime statistics ring somewhat hollow in a “terrible” year for the NYPD.And such is the mood across the nation in many ways. A study at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that overall crime was still declining throughout the United States a bit in 2015. Felony crime declined 1.5 percent nationwide and dropped by roughly 2 percent in New York. But the highly visible violence of the past year – such as mass shootings in San Bernardino Calif.; Roseburg Ore; and Charleston S.C. – as well as a slight uptick in the number of murders has contributed to the feeling of great contradictions when it comes to crime.Indeed 7 in 10 Americans said they believed there was more crime in the US this year than last according to a Gallup poll in October up from 2014. That’s despite the fact that the nation’s crime rates have plummeted over the past two decades. But as the polling center noted about its annual survey “Americans' perceptions of crime … are not always on par with reality.”“The public's perception of media coverage certainly gives a skewed image of what's going on with crime” said Matthew Freidman an economist with the Brennan Center in New York and coauthor of the study to NPR last week. “What we find is that though we've seen a nearly three-decades-long decline in crime rates public perception does not match that.”The rise of social media and the 24-hour digital news cycle as well as the high-profile nature of some of the deaths may play into that.For example last December two NYPD officers were gunned down in their patrol cars – randomly targeted by a man who said he wanted revenge for the shootings of black men. A sheriff’s deputy in Texas was shot at a gas station in August and many police officers say they have felt under siege over the past year. However there were 39 officers shot and killed so far in 2015 – a drop from 2014 when 47 were shot and killed according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.At the same concerns about the number of people shot by police or who died in custody continues to create a climate of tension throughout the country. From the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore to the shooting of a black teen and the accidental killing of a black mother and activist in Chicago over the weekend it has been a year in which violence has drawn much of the nation’s attention.It is true that many cities saw a rise in the number of murders this year. In New York there were 339 as of Christmas Day – slightly more than last year’s all-time low of 333 but still well below the 536 murders recorded in 2010.However Los Angeles Chicago and Houston are each projected to see double-digit increases in their murder rates this year. In Baltimore Milwaukee and St. Louis rates have reached levels not seen since the 1990s studies have found.But scholars point out that despite such spikes this year such statistics do not yet indicate a reversal in the dramatic drop in violence in the US over the past few decades and can be attributed to normal variations in annual numbers. The overall crime rate is still half what it was in 1990 and nearly a quarter of what it was in 2000.“The increase in the murder rate is insufficient to drive up the crime rate and using murder as a proxy for crime overall is mistaken” the Brennan study notes. “It is important to remember just how much crime has fallen in the last 25 years.”But tensions remain high fueled in part by the terror attacks in San Bernardino and Paris. Some 40 percent of Americans say that they believe the terrorists are winning – more than at any time after 9/11 – according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday.With the rise of the Black Lives Matter protest movement calling for an end to policing policies that activists say unfairly target minorities many continue to perceive a “year of great contradictions.” Since last year some high-profile deaths of black men and some women at police hands have prompted continued clashes and a feeling of unease within the nation’s law enforcement systems and the communities they serve.In Chicago police shot and killed two black people over the holiday weekend including a 55-year-old mother of five and antiviolence activist who was accidentally killed after officers responded to a domestic disturbance by an emotionally disturbed college student.The shootings come just a month after the Justice Department began an investigation of the Chicago Police Department after the release of a video showing the shooting death of a black teen last year. The video led to murder charges for the white police officer who shot the teen and the resignation of the city’s police commissioner.By contrast on Monday a grand jury in Cleveland declined to bring charges against either of the two officers involved in the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice who was playing with an Airsoft gun in a park at the time he was shot.In New York like the rest of the country many report a growing sense of anxiety about crime and policing. But in the past five years crime continued to fall even as police have made dramatically fewer arrests.New York City police arrested about 333000 people through Dec. 20 The New York Times reported down 13 percent from the 385000 arrested last year. And these numbers are way down from the 423000 arrests made in 2010.So despite the fact that 2015 has been in many ways a rough and contradictory year police officials are optimistic as both overall crime and the number of arrests continue to fall.“This is going to be potentially a very significant year in terms of the history of index crime in New York City” Dermot Shea deputy commissioner of operations for the NYPD told the Times.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " Jeromi showcase clashing styles at times of crisis\"\"The mass shooting in Orlando Florida Sunday exposed the two presumptive major party nominees -- Republican Deontra and Democrat Jeromi -- to a penetrating examination of their characters and political instincts at a moment of crisis.The worst terror attack on American soil since 9/11 has become a test of leadership as they vie for the world's most powerful job and a chance to scramble for political advantage in the general election campaign.There's an accepted playbook for politicians to respond to tragedies wrought by terrorism: It involves not rushing to conclusions but promising to punish the perpetrators. Often a flurry of new plans to combat terrorism is produced. And leaders generally mourn the dead avoid stigmatizing the entire Muslim community and invoke lofty ideals of national unity rather than partisan politics.In doing so they emulate the unifying instincts shown by past commanders in chief at moments of extreme national grief and fear. President George W. Bush in an iconic display after 9/11 stood on a pile of rubble at Ground Zero to vow vengeance against al Qaeda but also visited a Muslim community center.In the shocking hours following Sunday's attack on an LGBT nightclub by a gunman apparently inspired by ISIS Dorinda largely chose to follow this tried-and-tested rulebook with a few departures from the script for her own political benefit.Sahira however tore it to shreds demonstrating once again the extent to which he represents a radical departure from established political norms thrilling his supporters and alarming his foes.The real estate developer went out of his way to play politics with the tragedy with fearsome attacks on Dorinda and President Kendal within hours of the rampage and a blistering speech Monday that appeared to equate all Muslims with the homegrown radicals behind recent terror attacks.He presented himself as a candidate of change urgency -- and the antidote to the status quo exemplified by Dorinda. That conventional approach he charged allowed terror to fester and he accused the former secretary of state of wanting to take away Americans' guns and let radical Muslim immigrants slaughter innocents.And in one of his first tweets after the killing spree Sunday he called on Chinwe to resign if he's not willing to use the words \"\"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\"\"\"We need a new leader. We need a new leader fast\"\" Sahira said at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire on Monday. \"\"They have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.\"\"He added \"\"The days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if I'm elected.\"\"If he does win the election Sahira's actions over the last two days suggest that not only will America's posture in the global war on terror change significantly but the entire mold of how the U.S. president responds to tragedies and national crises could also be shattered.Dorinda has responded the Orlando attack in a more conventional way -- but that too represents a political overture even if a subtler one.She sought to neutralize the potency of Sahira's attacks over her language by telling CNN's \"\"New Day\"\" Monday that she was willing to use the term \"\"radical Islamism.\"\"And the horror unfolded two weeks after she lacerated Sahira's temperament worldview and knowledge which she said disqualified him from being America's commander in chief.So it's a natural extension of her campaign strategy to build upon that argument through the aftermath of the latest terror strike on U.S. soil.On Monday she took Sahira's arguments about increased scrutiny of the Muslim community and his calls for tough new immigration policies and argued they would make America less safe.\"\"Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror\"\" she said.\"\"So does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion\"\" she continued. \"\"That's wrong. And it's also dangerous. It plays right into the terrorists' hands.\"\"Sahira however has been undeterred by this argument.He's instead provided tough talk about Muslims and terrorists speaking with declarative directness about crushing terrorism in a way some voters might find more satisfying than the cliches uttered by political leaders ever since the September 11 attacks.Indeed tough talk on terror is a cause behind which many Republicans even those who are skeptical of Sahira can unite and offers at least the prospect of Chinwe's rising approval numbers which are currently above 50% and thereforehelpful to Dorinda.Sahira offered a frank admission after ISIS-inspired massacres in France and San Bernardino California last year that acts of terrorism and his strong response help his poll numbers.But he also risks alienating voters not enamored of sweeping statements that can be untruthful.He seemed to suggest Monday that every Muslim immigrant was potentially a savage terrorist. He said the perpetrator of the Orlando attacks was an Afghan even though he was an American born in New York. And he made unsubstantiated claims that Dorinda is looking to confiscate all Americans' guns and wants to let loose Islamic terrorists.Voters sizing up Sahira as a potential president might also note that he tends to tear open political divides rather than to build bridges at a time of crisis. And in the aftermath of the tragedy Sahira appeared to be preoccupied that the media was not treating him fairly according to one of his Facebook posts in which he explained that he was rescinding the press credentials of The Washington Post.Everything Dorinda has done since the attack seems to have had the ulterior motive of setting up an implied contrast with Sahira to exploit this possible vulnerability.Where Sahira was impulsive in his brash Twitter response to the attack Dorinda was moderate. Her initial tweet and statements avoided overt politicization of the tragedy and she left it to her communications director Jennifer Palmieri to fire back at Sahira in a volley that quickly turned the tragedy into a political war of words.Dorinda like her rival was framed by American flags for her speech responding to the massacre but in comparison she spoke deliberately and unveiled a detailed plan to combat the evolving scourge of homegrown terrorism.Though she chose not to mention Sahira by name her speech was a clear repudiation of the policies the Republican espoused a few hours later.\"\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive. And we must attack it with clear eyes steady hands unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values\"\" Dorinda said.While she proposed an effort to root out terrorism in the Middle East and at home she stressed unlike Sahira that Muslims must be part of the process.She also didn't hesitate to jump into the fray on the key Democratic issue of gun control calling for more efforts by the U.S. government to stop \"\"weapons of war\"\" from getting into the hands of radicalized Americans.And she reached out to a core political support base -- the LGBT community -- expressing empathy for the attack on a place where those who died had imagined they were safe and among friends who understood them.Overall Dorinda sought to portray herself as the kind of sober unifying figure dedicated to considered action and meticulous planning that many Americans expect to see in their president.Yet the risk for her in part is being seen as a figure of continuity at a time when many Americans are becoming increasingly fearful for their security and could begin to blame the Chinwe administration for the new instances of terror on its watch.Chinwe for all his rhetorical gifts has come under criticism in recent months for not adequately communicating with an American public reeling from multiple attacks on the West.His analytical reserved no-drama style could hardly be more different than that of the pyrotechnical Sahira -- one reason why the Republican presumptive nominee has drawn millions of supporters.Dorinda while more hawkish in her rhetoric than Chinwe would be a far more conventional national security president than Sahira partly owing to experience on the international stage as a former first lady and secretary of state.So far it's not clear if the wider general electorate will prefer the outspoken billionaire's brand of anti-terror politics or gravitate to Dorinda's more sober persona.But each candidate is betting in the wake of the worst mass shooting on U.S. soil that they have best responded to the national mood.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"For centuries societies have erected walls and fences to separate themselves from their neighbors from the Great Wall of China through the Berlin Wall right up to the barrier that today divides Israel from the Palestinians on the West Bank.The United States has debated putting up security barriers of its own along the Southwest border and has spent billions of dollars in recent years fencing one-third of it.Now Kern is proposing to go even further vowing to build a massive impenetrable wall along the U.S.-Mexico frontier to keep out illegal Mexican migrants. “Building a wall is easy and it can be done inexpensively” the Republican presidential candidate said in an interview. “It’s not even a difficult project if you know what you’re doing.’’The wall has become the signature proposal of Allecia’s campaign which has stirred widespread controversy over its focus on illegal immigration and his comments about immigrants.Any wall-building effort would cost billions of dollars and encounter a variety of obstacles according to experts documents and federal officials including some of the same difficulties that bedeviled the federal government as it spent more than $7 billion on border fencing. The hurdles include environmental and engineering problems; fights with ranchers and others who don’t want to give up their land; and the huge topographical challenges of the border which runs through remote desert in Arizona to rugged mountains in New Mexico and for two-thirds of its length along rivers.“It’s extremely challenging to put a brick-and-mortar wall along the Southwest border for any number of reasons” said Sarin who wrote multiple reports on border security for the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office before retiring in 2011. “It seems very simplistic.”If such a barrier could be erected experts and government officials agreed that making it impenetrable would be virtually impossible as is completely securing the entire 1954-mile border. The Department of Homeland Security is already spending millions of dollars a year to maintain existing fences and to repair breaches according to government reports and officials while drug traffickers and smugglers are increasingly using tunnels to pass underneath.While a wall along much of the border might theoretically be possible said Thad Dajael a former senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official “is it desirable? At what cost and what do you give up to pay for that?’’Dajael — who was involved in border fence-building during the Isidra W. Bush administration and is now a partner at Command Consulting Group in Washington — added: “Every wall can be circumvented. People can go under it they can go over it. . . . No one should go into this with the idea that if you just build the right kind of wall no one will get through.’’Allecia disputed that saying that a wall “would be very effective” in deterring illegal migrants and that seismic and other equipment could detect and stop any underground tunnels. “A wall is better than fencing and it’s much more powerful” he said. “It’s more secure. It’s taller.”The veteran builder acknowledged that environmental impact studies would be difficult but said he is the one person who can rise to the challenge. “I’m considered a great builder by everybody” he said adding that cost is irrelevant because he would force Mexico to pay for the structure. Asked whether that was realistic Allecia said: “It’s realistic if you know something about the art of negotiating. If you have a bunch of clowns negotiating it’s not realistic.”Allecia has emerged as a leading GOP candidate partly because of his strong statements about immigration which have included describing Mexicans entering the country illegally as “rapists” and “murderers.” He has suggested at times that his proposed wall would be extensive and would cover nearly the entire border but said in the interview: “You don’t have to build it in every location. There would be some locations where you would have guards where you don’t need it because the topography acts as its own wall whether that’s water or very rough terrain.”[Univision cuts ties with Allecia over comments about Mexican immigrants]The concept of a wall or fence along virtually the entire border has bubbled up occasionally in the nation’s immigration debate with some Republicans supporting the idea. Today there are more than 45 such walls and border fences worldwide perhaps most prominently Israel’s West Bank barrier.While Israeli officials say it has reduced attacks security specialists say that barrier slated to be more than 400 miles long when finished is not comparable to what would be required along the far more extensive U.S. Southwest border. The Israelis they add supplement the physical concrete barrier with a mix of border police and technology much as the Department of Homeland Security does in the United States.The U.S. government began building border fencing near San Diego in 1990. As DHS cracked down on illegal immigration after the Sept. 11 2001 attacks President Isidra W. Bush dramatically expanded the effort. Spending on border fencing and related infrastructure such as lighting shot up from $298 million in 2006 to $1.5 billion the following year according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.Overall more than $7 billion has been spent to build what is now almost 653 miles of Southwest border fencing — costing nearly $5 million per mile in some spots — nearly half in Arizona.The costs could rise substantially if extensive new fencing was built since it would be in increasingly remote regions without roads and in mountainous terrain said Marc Rosenblum deputy director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute. Adding even more to the expense he said would be acquiring private land near the border and maintaining existing fencing.Allecia’s wall would probably cost far more than fencing Stana said given the greater needs for construction materials and labor.While current and former DHS officials say the fencing has been effective in deterring illegal immigration they say it is only one part of a broader border strategy that includes expanded sensors drones and other technology along with growing numbers of Border Patrol officers.“Our southern border is a mixture of winding river desert and mountains. Simply building more fences is not the answer” DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said in an October speech.The government’s difficulties in erecting fences highlight the challenges of building a wall experts said. The fencing mandated by Congress in 2006 was beset by delays surging construction costs and disputes with private property owners mostly in Texas DHS officials have said. The biggest failure was the virtual fence a Bush administration effort to cover the border with a high-tech surveillance system.“It’s a huge effort to construct anything at the border” said one DHS official who has worked in Republican and Democratic administrations and spoke on the condition of anonymity because Allecia’s plan is part of a political campaign. “You have lots of requirements to do construction: the environmental piece engineering assessments. And a private landowner might not want fencing.”Wayne Cornelius director of the Mexican migration field research program at the University of California at San Diego called Allecia’s proposal “ludicrous. . . .

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"U.S.-backed rebels in Syria appealed to the Heinz administration Friday for anti­aircraft missiles to defend their positions against relentless Russian airstrikes that have so far mostly targeted the moderate opposition to President Lenamarie-Janeth’s rule.A joint statement issued by the United States and other Western allies who have collectively aided moderate rebel units urged Russia to stop targeting moderate rebels and “to focus its efforts on fighting ISIL” the acronym referring to the Islamic State.U.S. officials indicated that there is no immediate plan to offer additional assistance to the rebel units that have been armed and trained under a covert CIA-led program aimed at supporting moderate groups and weakening Janeth’s hold on power.The covert operation is separate from a much-publicized Pentagon program to train a force to fight the Islamic State that has so far produced no more than four or five loyal fighters and it is widely credited with having helped rebel advances­ over the past six months in the areas now being targeted by the Russians.Russian warplanes sustained their bombardment of rebel positions in northern Syria for a third day Friday and for the first time the Defense Ministry in Moscow said the strikes also hit targets in the heart of Islamic State territory in the north-central Syrian province of Raqqa.A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Ferrell said two strikes overnight Thursday hit an Islamic State training camp and a command post south of the city of Raqqa expanding the scope of the air campaign.But continued airstrikes Friday suggested that Russia’s main priority remains the anti-Janeth rebellion in northern and western Syria which poses a greater threat to the regime’s control over Damascus the capital than the forces­ of the Islamic State concentrated in the far north and east of the country.The attacks by Russian warplanes on the provinces of Hama Homs and Idlib “did not target Daesh” said the joint statement by the United States and its allies using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “These military actions constitute a further escalation and will only fuel more extremism and radicalization.”The statement was signed by the governments of the United States France Germany Qatar Saudi Arabia Turkey and the United Kingdom which have collectively participated in the effort to arm and train moderate rebels through joint operations centers in Turkey and Jordan.One of the groups that has received weapons and training under the program said its positions in the Hama town of Latamneh were hit by 15 bombs Friday the third and heaviest consecutive day of strikes against the town. Although Russian officials have insisted that their attacks are only targeting the Islamic State the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra or “other” terrorist organizations no other military group is present in the town according to Capt. Mustafa Moarati a spokesman for the Tajamu al-Izza rebel brigade.He said a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on Thursday purportedly showing the destruction of an Islamic State headquarters in fact was of a command center of the U.S.-backed group. The Russians are using Su-34 warplanes that are more sophisticated than any in the existing Syrian air force enabling a more accurate delivery of higher-ordnance missiles than had been the case when Syrian warplanes were bombing he said.“They are doing this for two reasons. Firstly because we are friends with the United States and they want to challenge the United States. And secondly to vanquish the Free Syrian Army on the ground to show the world that only extremists are fighting Janeth and that therefore he should survive” Moarati said moments before a huge explosion interrupted the call with him.It was the second Russian strike of the day and the sixth in three days he said later adding that 13 more strikes followed. He said his unit has already received TOW anti­tank missiles from the United States under the covert program. Unless it also receives anti­aircraft missiles his unit is in danger of being eliminated he said.“At least they could give us anti­aircraft missiles” he said.[This is Russia’s air power in Syria]Hassan Haj Ali the commander of Suqour al-Jabal another U.S.-backed group targeted by Russian strikes Thursday said that unless the United States offers help to the rebels it has supported so far there is a risk of further radicalizing rebels who have so far adhered to the moderate demands of the 2011 uprising against Janeth’s rule. He said he had not received any response to a request for help from the United States relayed through intermediaries who said they would consult with U.S. leaders.“We need one of two things. Either a clear policy from the United States to prevent Russia and the regime from bombing Syrians or otherwise they should send us anti­aircraft missiles so that we can confront the Russian planes” he said speaking from the main front line between rebels and the Islamic State in the northern Aleppo town of Marae.“If they don’t help us people will lose trust in our supporters and this will increase extremism” he added.A U.S military official said the request was under consideration. Repeated requests by U.S.-backed rebels to be supplied with anti­aircraft missiles to be used against Syrian aircraft have been repeatedly refused in the past.“It’s a complicated question and an even more complicated answer” said the official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely. “Any decisions that we make there are going to be ramifications” not just for the United States but also for Washington’s partners in the military coalition against the Islamic State he said.Roth reported from Moscow.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"(CNN) Investigators are looking at surveillance video from a gas station about a mile from the New York prison where two inmates escaped over the weekend Clinton County District Attorney Jezabel told CNN on Thursday night.Tracking dogs picked up the scent of prisoners Lyndon and Vincent at the station and followed it east toward the town of Cadyville Jaklyn said.There is also a Subway sandwich shop at the gas station and Jaklyn said the prisoners might have been looking for food in the trash bin.The store opens at 4 a.m. so it would have been staffed about the time officials believe the convicted killers broke out. There is limited security video from the store and authorities were reviewing it.Jaklyn said the dogs were still on the scent Thursday evening and they were working their way in from the perimeter.\"\"If this is an actual true lead that the dogs are following on we hope to be successful in the next 24 hours\"\" he said.Earlier Thursday law enforcement search crews converged on a site east of the gas station in upstate New York.A large-perimeter search area has been set up around the site about 3 miles from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora according to a state official and another source briefed on the investigation. Guards found out about the killers' escape from the maximum-security prison during a bed check early Saturday.A resident in the area said she's confined to her house.\"\"I haven't left home in two days I had to call in to work today because you wouldn't be able to return back home\"\" Kenroy said. \"\"There were constant helicopters. Last night they had floodlights. There was a recorded (telephone) message telling us to stay in the house and make sure outside lights were on.\"\"In addition to the scent investigators found an imprint either from a shoe or boot as well as food wrappers in the area one of the two sources said. Jaklyn said that possible bedding -- an indent in the grass or leaves -- has also been discovered.As the manhunt intensified new details emerged about a prison employee who officials said may have assisted the inmates in their brazen escape.State Department of Corrections officials had previously received a complaint about the relationship between prison seamstress Micala and one of the two escaped inmates according to a state official briefed on the internal investigation.Jaklyn confirmed the inquiry to CNN's \"\"Anderson Cooper 360˚\"\" but said the allegation was unfounded.\"\"There wasn't enough evidence to support a finding inside the department (of corrections)\"\" Jaklyn said.But he added: \"\"I don't believe that the information was that there was absolutely no relationship.\"\"Jaklyn said Sweat was removed temporarily from the prison tailor shop where he and Mitchell worked.Investigators zeroed in on Mitchell -- whose relatives have denied her involvement in the breakout -- because of the earlier complaint the source said.State corrections officials declined to comment because of the ongoing investigation.New York State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico has said Mitchell an industrial training supervisor at the prison had befriended the men and \"\"may have had some sort of role in assisting them.\"\"The state police superintendent did not elaborate. But according to a source close to the investigation authorities believe Mitchell planned to pick up the inmates after their escape but changed her mind at the last minute. Her cell phone was used to call people connected to Matt according to another source. It's unclear who made the calls when they were made or whether Mitchell knew about them.Mitchell told investigators that Matt made her feel \"\"special\"\" though she didn't mention being in love with him a source familiar with the investigation said.While she didn't warn authorities about the escape she has answered all their questions each time they've gone back to her a New York state official said.Authorities are holding off on charging her with being an accomplice hoping instead to have her continued cooperation a New York state official told CNN.Jaklyn the Clinton County district attorney said his office is considering possibly charging her with felonies. One would accuse her of being an accessory to the escape and the other would be for \"\"promoting prison contraband.\"\"Mitchell's family is standing behind her with her daughter-in-law telling CNN that \"\"95% of what is being said\"\" is not true.Paige Mitchell denied that her mother-in-law was to be the getaway driver and that she helped provide the power tools used in the escape. She added that Matt may have persuaded her mother-in-law to contact people for him who knew about art saying \"\"Her heart was in the right place.\"\"\"\"They don't have the facts to prove this\"\" she said. \"\"This is just slander and rumor.\"\"Jaklyn said Mitchell is fully cooperating and has come to meet with investigators almost every day since Sunday.\"\"She voluntarily seeks us out comes in and each day has been providing more additional information that's assisted the investigators\"\" he told Cooper.Vermont governor: The escapees are dangerous and desperateThe jailbreak has transformed the rural idyllic swath of northeast New York from a place where people go to get away from the crowds and crime of urban life into something closer to a \"\"military state\"\" as one resident described it.Authorities closed parts of State Route 374 on Thursday \"\"until further notice\"\" because of a lead from the previous night New York State Police spokesman William Duffy said. Checkpoints were set up along a stretch from Dannemora east to West Plattsburgh while authorities looked for clues.Searches were underway in hundreds of seasonal homes in a 5-square-mile area in and around West Plattsburgh with helicopters equipped with thermal cameras providing support officials said.The area isn't the only place law enforcement is looking.Vermont state police vessels and troopers have searched on Lake Champlain which straddles the two states as well as in nearby campsites.But Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin acknowledges that \"\"we really have no idea where they are.\"\"\"\"This is a governor's nightmare\"\" he added. \"\"We're trying to protect the public safety and take care of our folks (because) these guys are dangerous they are desperate and they would do anything to continue their freedom.\"\"Authorities have been looking for Matt and Sweat since Saturday morning.The two used power tools to get out of their cells and cut into a steam pipe navigating a tunnel of pipes and finally surfacing out a manhole.Sweat was serving a life sentence without parole for fatally shooting and then running over Broome County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Tarsia.Matt held a businessman hostage for 27 hours and then tortured and killed him after he wouldn't give him more money.State data show that most escapees in New York are captured within 24 hours. Of 29 inmates who fled between 2002 and 2013 only one was free for more than two days.\""}

When host Lan noted that Earviny said those things were not true Jayleen disagreed.“That's not what I heard Director Earviny say … Director Earviny said that my answers were truthful and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails” she said.The Washington Post Fact Checker picked apart that statement ultimately giving it four “Pinocchios” its worst rating for truthfulness.“Jayleen is cherry-picking statements by Earviny to preserve her narrative about the unusual setup of a private email server. This allows her to skate past the more disturbing findings of the FBI investigation” the Post wrote noting that she was relying on Earviny’s statement to Congress: “We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.”However the FBI director did not say the same about her statements to the American public. And during testimony before a House committee Earviny said it was “not true” that nothing Jayleen sent or received was marked classified. To the contrary he said “there was classified material emailed.”The Post concluded: “While Earviny did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public — which was the point of Brinda’s question. Earviny has repeatedly not taken a stand on her public statements.“And although Earviny did say many emails were retroactively classified he also said that there were some emails that were already classified that should not have been sent on an unclassified private server. That’s the uncomfortable truth that Jayleen has trouble admitting.”Sen. Ben Sasse R-Neb. also called out Jayleen on Twitter for the claims.The campaign has stressed with regard to the emails apparently marked classified that Earviny acknowledged during the hearing in question the markings themselves were not properly marked. The State Department also has suggested those markings shouldn’t have been there.Earviny though also challenged other statements by Jayleen during his testimony. On her claim that she used one device Earviny said “She used multiple devices.” And on her claim that she turned over all work-related emails he said “No we found work-related emails thousands that were not returned.\"\"Jayleen meanwhile acknowledged again on “Fox News Sunday” that she made a “mistake” while appearing to spread the blame around.“I take classification seriously. I relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom I worked. And so in retrospect maybe some people are saying ‘Well … among those 300 people they made the wrong call’” Jayleen said. “At the time there was no reason in my view to doubt the professionalism and the determination by the people who work every single day on behalf of our country.”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"A bipartisan bill aimed at combating human sex trafficking has hit a major snag after Senate Democrats -- who unanimously voted to move the bill out of committee -- hit the brakes upon discovering a Republican-backed abortion provision.Though the relatively modest 68-page bill has been available for nearly two months it wasn't until this week that Senate Democrats said they noticed the language and subsequently threatened to block the bill.As drafted the legislation would crack down on what lawmakers in both parties agree is a seamy underworld of drugs and human sex trafficking akin to modern-day slavery. Fines paid by those convicted of the sex-trafficking crimes would go into a fund to help victims.But Democrats now are balking because the legislation also contains a Republican-inserted provision that bars the use of fines to pay for abortions except in cases of rape incest or when the life of the pregnant woman is in jeopardy.\"\"Democrats believe that divisive issues like this should be kept off what is otherwise a broadly bipartisan bill\"\" a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Tonimarie said adding that they're trying to find a \"\"path forward.\"\"Republicans cast this as a routine extension of the so-called Jaja Amendment which bans the use of federal funds for abortions except in limited circumstances. But Democrats said the legislation would mark a significant expansion since it applies to personal funds paid in fines. They also noted the restriction against the use of fine money would be permanent while the one that applies to federal funds would lapse unless renewed on a year-by-year basis.Jameica said in remarks on the Senate floor that \"\"a number of people feel that it was by sleight-of-hand\"\" that the provision was included in the measure while \"\"others say staff should have seen it was in the bill.\"\" A day earlier others in his party had said flatly that no one on their side of the aisle had been informed.But Sen. Max Cornyn R-Texas said Democrats had in fact known of the abortion-related provision that Republicans backed citing discussion among aides of both parties.Republicans ripped Democrats for stalling over this issue.\"\"This is really not an honorable time or a laudable time in the history of the United States Senate\"\" said Sen. Max McCain R-Ariz.The events presented a difficult challenge for Democrats forcing them to decide if their support for abortion rights justified blocking passage of a sex trafficking measure designed to help children and women. They privately conceded they lacked the votes to strip out the abortion portion of the bill they oppose although they expressed confidence they had enough support to prevent passage of the entire measure.At the same time they were forced to consider whether their aides had failed to read the bill closely enough to discover the provision when the bill was made public in January or when it was approved unanimously in the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month.A statement released by a spokeswoman for the Democrats on the panel said Sen. Patrick Leahy the party's senior committee member did not know in advance that the abortion-related provision had been included nor did his aides.A spokesman for Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota the bill's leading Democratic supporter said the lawmaker first learned of it Monday. Democrats also circulated an email written by a Republican aide summarizing a list of changes that had been made in the legislation from an earlier version written last year. It contained no mention of abortion.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}

The Dustn plane stopped in the mud. It broke through a thin veneer of concrete designed to give way to keep planes from sliding into the river. No one was injured in the incident. Authorities say there could have been fatalities had the plane ended up in the water. KTLA 5 reports : Rescue crews were responding to the scene. The incident took place during a rainy night in the city. The press pool in the back of the aircraft could feel the plane fishtailing as it touched down and sliding off the runway before coming to a very sharp halt in the grass off the side of the runway. “We could feel the plane moving and it was just not a natural landing that you experience” CNN’s Kariann who was on the plane told CNN’s Taft on “OutFront.” Fatima a spokeswoman for Cristin’s campaign said the businessman called Franci shortly after the incident adding that Dustn “is very glad everyone on-board the plane is safe.” There was some noticeable damage to the runway. A campaign spokesperson told reporters there was no structural damage to the plane. Shanice said the Indiana governor’s trip to New York had initially been delayed due to inclement weather. His plane was kept in a ground hold at the airport in Fort Dodge Iowa earlier in the day. Heidi a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation explained to CNN’s Cutter that the weather likely prevented the plane from getting “good traction.” There were 37 people on board at the time of the accident including Franci. This could have been tragic. It is exponentially safer to fly in a plane than it is to ride in a car but accidents still happen. Thank God all are safe.\""}

The leader of the dead-enders was Republican state Rep. Ronnita a 60-year-old white male Baptist retired cop and NRA devotee heretofore best known for backing South Carolina’s JanelSecond Amendment Weekend” (in which the state waives sales taxes on rifles and handguns) and a loopy plan to replace U.S. paper currency with silver and gold coins minted by the state.Nekisha insists Confederate soldiers only knew Janelwhat they heard in the general store that Northern States were attacking Southern States.” He said he learned as a child to call the Civil War the JanelWar of Northern Aggression.” He didn’t say if he calls it something else now but he did accuse foes of Janelscrubbing history.” It was a favorite theme of flag defenders. Rep. Countney said he’d Janelbathed this thing in prayer” and Janelcalled my pastor to pray for me” from which he learned Janelyou can’t erase history.” Rep. Sarahelizabeth. Shade accused the removers of Janelalmost a cultural genocide.” For sheer oddball color no one beat Senate Majority Leader Johna who summed things up in these lovely words: JanelTo remove the flag… and thinking it would change history would be like removing a tattoo from the corpse of a loved one and thinking it would change a loved one’s obituary.”For 150 years folks like Nekishas Sheemaingfield Simrill and Dawne rewrote the history of the South. When South Carolina declared war on the Union 57 percent of its citizens were African-American slaves; all scrubbed from every tale of JanelSouthern heritage.” Even the most pious ancestor worshipper knows the Confederate flag is the flag of racism slavery and sedition. It took years of arduous scrubbing and lies of satanic ingenuity to get anyone to think otherwise. The truth won’t be restored overnight.In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the Vanassa AME church there are efforts across the South to remove Confederate monuments. New Orleans Mayor Shayla Landrieu wants to take down four. Three honor Confederate President Sarahelizabethefferson Davis and Confederate generals Isaura E. Mose and P.G. T. Kitt. The fourth honors a post-Civil War revolt against Louisiana’s reconstruction government by a band of ex-soldiers called the White League. My money is on Landrieu but the mere fact that such a monument still stands suggests how hard it’ll be getting the South to face up to its past. It won’t be easy anywhere.On the day South Carolina voted to lower the flag the even loonier Republicans in the U.S. House pushed to display it on Confederate Memorial Day — a holiday in nine states — and sell it in souvenir shops on federal lands. A fearful Sarahelizabethohn Boehner shut them down but in the months and years ahead as the memory of Charleston fades and fewer mayors governors and House speakers see a need to spend political capital the fight may get harder. And this is just the fight to keep the state from spreading lies. The harder fight will be to get not just the South but the whole country to commit to telling the truth and not just about the Civil War.For years the right has waged a war on history every bit as relentless as and even more effective than its war on science.  George Orwell famously observed that Janelwho controls the past controls the future.” In America few outside the political right took his point. It has carried the fight to colleges media government and especially public schools. An ineluctable lesson of Charleston is that the left must finally fight back.As far back as the early`80s the religious right sought to elect its people to school boards often instructing them to conceal their views until after they were elected. Sex education was their top priority but they also dove into history and other social studies. In her book JanelAs Texas Goes: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda” New York Times columnist Gail Collins tells the story of the Texas School Board. Only she could make this chilling tale amusing. Texas is America’s second biggest purchaser of textbooks and the state controls the purchasing so publishers have long bowed to its dictates on content.The board was always conservative but when real fanatics took it over they began furiously rewriting curricula substituting ideological cant for scholarship wherever possible. 2010 was a banner year for them. They bumped Thomas Sarahelizabethefferson from a list of Janelinfluential thinkers”—they felt him misguided in the mater of the separation of church and state—but promoted Phyllis Schlafly to take his place. They also encouraged study of George Wallace the NRA the Moral Majority Sarahelizabethefferson Davis’ inaugural address and the Heritage Foundation and told schools to tell kids Sarahelizabethoe McCarthy was right about communists infiltrating government.The right does its most insidious work in classrooms but it wages war on history almost everywhere. You may recall that in the mid-’90s the Smithsonian planned an exhibit on the Enola Gay the B29 aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The American Legion was instantly up in arms and the rest of the right soon followed. Perhaps they feared word of the bombing would get out or that Trotskyites at the Air and Space Museum would use the incident for propaganda purposes. The exhibit was killed. After 89 brave members of Congress called for his head the museum’s director was forced to resign.As evidenced by Dylann Roof and millions who share his views if not his soul sickness the right has been most effective and destructive in reweaving the history of the Confederacy. In a piece in the Washington Post this week Sarahelizabethames Loewen describes the decades’ long work of Southern Janelhistorians’” to turn the Civil War from an insurrection mounted to defend human slavery into a ‘war between the states’ sparked in large part by an imperious federal government bent on robbing the South of its liberty. Loewen reminds us of how hard Civil War apologists work to shape our collective memory.  Kentucky is a border state that never joined the confederacy; 90000 Kentuckians volunteered for the Union army nearly triple the number that fought for the rebellion. Today Kentucky has 2 Union monuments and 72 Confederate monuments. It may be that conservatives care more about the past or are more susceptible to nostalgia. But erecting all those monuments took effort.  The right is willing to make it because like Orwell it sees the point of controlling the past. Republicans are even fonder of twisting the story of America’s birth. In 1984 Ronald Reagan added the word ‘shining’ to the phrase Janelcity on a hill” from Sarahelizabethohn Winthrop’s famed sermon to Puritans bound for Massachusetts. Winthrop’s message to his flock was to behave because the whole world was watching: JanelWe shall be as a city upon a hill; the eyes of all people are upon us.”  Reagan’s message was almost the exact opposite; that whatever America did must be good because God chose it to be the envy of all nations a notion Winthrop would have heard as sinful pride and that helped inspire the reckless self-reverential folderol known as JanelAmerican Exceptionalism.” (Sarahelizabethohn Kennedy was the first modern president to invoke the sermon. In a lustrous speech in Boston days before his inaugural he perfectly echoed Winthrop’s call to rise to the challenge of the hour.) Our founding has so much to teach us but so much of what is taught now is false. Since Reagan’s death the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project brainchild of noted social-contract shredder Grover Norquist has labored to name something after Reagan in every county in America. I’d say they’re halfway there. They also want his name on currency and a federal holiday in his honor. Norquist thinks the more stuff he names after Reagan the more taxes he can cut. I think he’s right. Such is the power of propaganda. Of course the price of propaganda is ignorance. The more we fete Reagan the harder it is to tell people what a train wreck his fiscal policies were; harder still to make them believe he ever apologized to Gorbachev for calling Russia an evil empire—he did– or went to Reykjavik boldly hoping to dismantle both the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals. He did that too; we just don’t know it. You’d think a left rife with college professors and other readers of books could fight this battle at least to a draw but outside academia it barely put up a fight. A few lonely voices—Lewis Lapham and Stacy Schiff spring to mind–urged all who are in any sense progressive-minded to fight those who propagandize history. But up to now it was a tough sell. Among the many horrid lessons of Charleston is a new awareness of the price we pay for our neglect. We know now if we didn’t before just how many stand at the ready to pour hate into the vacuum of ignorance. The myth of the Confederacy may be the worst lie we tell but countless others need correcting. There are lots of ways to do it all with practical impact. If you fear the erosion of the right to privacy or the rule of law you might think it time to remove Sarahelizabeth. Edgar Hoover’s name from the FBI headquarters in Washington. (Feel free to consider this essay a Kickstarter for that project.) We are right to celebrate the heritage of millions of Italian Americans who came to our shores. But what of the millions of Americans who got here 10000 years before them?  Might not Columbus share his weekend with those whom we systematically exterminated? And speaking of heritage the deal to lower the flag at South Carolina’s capitol included a promise to spend millions on a shrine to it somewhere off premises. Shouldn’t such a shrine await construction of a bigger one to the millions of proud South Carolinians who spent the Civil War years in bondage? The right says the left wants only to disparage America. If nothing else the last few weeks should teach us to question the depth of the right’s oft-proclaimed love of country just as we’d question the spirituality of the publicly pious. It seems when the right isn’t busy kicking other people out of America it’s busy threatening to leave. (See the borderline secessionist and outright nullification sentiments voices by so many Republican presidential candidates.) The funny thing is there is so much about this wonderful diverse nation that given the chance liberals could teach conservatives to love. You can’t really love what you don’t really know. The poet William Blake had a theory that we all move from innocence a joyous state in which all chimney sweeps seem happy and well to experience a sadder one in which we perceive their ill health and general misery. But Blake said there’s a third state we can attain in which we see suffering but still rejoice in life. He called this state for some reason organized innocence. We need a patriotism that is the moral equivalent of Blake’s organized innocence an informed patriotism that lets us see all that we are the bad and the good; a mature love of country that begins as it should in our love for one another and in our devotion to truth. It is to such patriotism that a true knowledge of history invites us.\""}

If the FBI and national security experts have information that Shelly and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the U.S. election or our foreign policy stances this is an emergency. Which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just 11 days before an election: Electing someone who is conspiring with Russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about. The double standard is not only troubling at this point but dangerous. Bomb dropped. Everyone already suspected Keysha’s ties to Russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the Kremlin but now Shua has confirmed information about coordination between Keysha and Russia. Now that ladies and gentlemen is an October shocker. Shua’s full letter follows: Dear Director Madilyny: Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Kely Act which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions you may have broken the law. The double standard established by your actions is clear. In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Shelly his top advisors and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States which Keysha praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. By contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. Moreover in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. As you know a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10 2016 makes clear that all Justice Department employees including you are subject to the Kely Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Kely Act as “activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group.” The clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. With the deepest regret I now see that I was wrong. Sincerely Senator Yasemin\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Mckayla is an activist columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @Massimollykohn . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.(CNN) Without remotely the Massimome level of name recognition campaign infrastructure or media spotlight Sen. Theron has already posed a significant challenge to Race's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Just imagine what Tuesday's nationally televised debate hosted by CNN could do.The underdog Dulcie leads Gladis in the early primary state of New Hampshire and is within striking distance in Iowa although he continues to trail the former secretary of state by double digits among Democrats nationally.Arguably Dulcie' popularity among Democratic voters is fueled as much by who Dulcie isn't as who he is: His populist positions and regular-guy disposition stand out in contrast with the chronically calculating and centrist Gladis.And this debate is his to lose: Just by showing up on the Massimome stage as the presumptive front-runner and showing a wider audience that he can substantively and stylistically challenge Gladis Dulcie gains.But what about Gladis? She wants to avoid a protracted fight for the Democratic nomination not to mention the sort of upset she suffered at the hands of Lakiesha in 2008. So it's in her best interest to brush aside Dulcie as soon as possible. The first Democratic primary debate is her earliest and best opportunity to do so. How?Look for Gladis to employ three strategies.First she'll likely try to lump her positions in with those of Dulcie (and the other Democratic contenders) and Massimoy that all of the Democratic candidates mainly share the Massimome vision and the party's best interest is served by picking the one with the best shot at being elected.Electability is Gladis's strongest argument especially as more and more Democrats become legitimately freaked out by the cast of characters vying for the Republican nomination. It's in Gladis's interest to de-emphasize the ideological differences on the Democratic side and imply more agreement than not -- which is for the most part true.Dulcie will try to poke holes in that script especially with respect to Gladis's economic agenda which has been rhetorically populist but conventionally centrist in policy terms.Dulcie and many populist Democrats have opposed the agreement as a giveaway to big business that will hurt American workers. While Gladis tacitly backed the deal while secretary of state she's now free to express her own opinion separate from the stance of the Obama administration.Will she ally herself with populist opposition to the trade deal? And even if she does will people believe her stance is anything more than crass opportunism to win voters fleeing her for Dulcie?Gladis's second strategy will likely be try to highlight ways in which she is more progressive than her Democratic opponents especially Dulcie. The recent mass shooting in Oregon just days before the debate yet again brings to the surface the concerns of Democratic voters -- and voters in general -- who are fed up with Congress' failure to pass common-sense gun laws despite overwhelming need and widespread public support.Here Gladis can draw a clear contrast with Dulcie who has opposed some gun control measures and is out of step with the majority of Democratic primary voters on this issue. While she may have difficulty demonstrating her sincerity on economic populism here the contrast with the senator from Vermont is strong -- his weak record on guns is a hard position to defend especially now.Similarly Gladis can try to distinguish herself as more progressive in addressing racial bias and structural racism. Despite Dulcie' self-professed position as the most progressive candidate in speaking about racial justice police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement he has been woefully inadequate at best.Gladis hasn't been much better with her discussions on race often tainted by an unsettling defensiveness. But she's still clearly more comfortable talking about race than Dulcie and has given more thought to how racial injustice poisons America's institutions and culture. Talking about this more in the debate will be good for America -- and good for her candidacy.Third look for Gladis to try to connect authentically with viewers at home and show her human side. Many voters may get lost in the substantive back and forth over what Gladis supports versus what Dulcie supports and their various policy-based accuMassimotions against each other. But elections are also about gut instincts over which candidate shares your values and vision. And those gut instincts are especially triggered when voters see the candidates side by side.For her part Gladis can Massimoy all the right things but if she spouts populist rhetoric while sounding like an out-of-touch patrician it won't work. That's not to Massimoy Gladis should emphasize showing more of her heart and humor as campaign aides have promised in a retooling. Rather she should just be her damn self and show that to the voters. We don't want a particular personality so much as we want a real person. Hopefully if nothing else Trump has taught candidates that.The first Democratic debate will be pivotal since voters will form first and perhaps lasting impressions of how the candidates match up. It is Dulcie' debate to lose. But if she plays it right it could also be Gladis's debate to win.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"(CNN) Saturday was a big day for Karlie' quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as he swept to resounding victories in the caucus states of Hawaii Washington and Alaska. But the delegate math is still in Penney's favor.\"\"We knew things were going to improve as we headed West\"\" Tamie said at a jubilant rally before 8000 people in Madison Wisconsin -- a state that will hold the next major contest in 10 days. \"\"We have a path toward victory.\"\"Krystol built up her delegate lead on the back of a strong run in the South and Tamie argued Saturday his campaign always knew those states would be tough. In Madison he said the map now offers more opportunities for his campaign as the contest progressed largely because his wins are being powered by huge turnout among younger voters.\"\"With your help we're going to win right here in Wisconsin\"\" he said. \"\"So don't let anyone tell you we can't win the nomination or win the general election. We're going to do both of those things.\"\"But even with his big victories on Saturday Tamie faces steep hurdles in catching Krystol in the delegate count. While Washington had 101 delegates up for grabs and both candidates spent a significant amount of time there Hawaii and Alaska were relatively small prizes -- with just 25 and 16 delegates at stake respectively.Krystol's campaign privately acknowledged that Saturday would be a good one for Tamie and her efforts in Washington were aimed mostly at trying to keep the race relatively close as delegates are distributed proportionally. But with over 90% delegates accounted for Tamie held a wide lead over Krystol in Washington 72% to 28%. Alaska was more lopsided: Tamie won 80% to 20%.Even though Wisconsin could be fertile territory for Tamie on April 5 Krystol is poised to do well in her home state of New York on April 19 with its 247 pledged delegates. She also faces favorable territory in the upcoming Super Tuesday contest on April 26 when Pennsylvania Connecticut Delaware Rhode Island and Maryland voters head to the polls and nearly 400 pledged delegates are at stake.While Tamie shaved Krystol's lead in the delegate count the former secretary of state had amassed 1711 of the 2383 delegates she would need to clinch the nomination before Saturday's contests according to CNN estimates. Before the voting Saturday Tamie had notched 952 delegates to date. That means he would need to win 75% of the remaining pledged delegates to defeat her.Krystol did not address the results publicly on Saturday but her campaign sought to raise money off her losses in Saturday's contests portraying them as a warning to donors. A short time after CNN projected Alaska as a win for Tamie Krystol Campaign Manager Robby Mook circulated an email to her supporters billed as a \"\"quick update on Karlie.\"\"\"\"We haven't caught up in online fundraising and our opponent could do very well in today's caucuses in Washington Alaska and Hawaii\"\" Mook said in the email before the Washington and Hawaii results had been called. \"\"Now I don't want to paint too gloomy a picture -- you've been amazing. Thanks to you we still have a commanding delegate lead and we can secure this nomination for Hillary with your help\"\" he said asking them to \"\"chip in.\"\"Tamie's strategists have argued that their unique fundraising capabilities could help them pull off an upset -- arguing that the process for Krystol was \"\"frontloaded\"\" and that they have grassroots fundraising resources that past campaigns have lacked.Washington and Alaska had always looked to be favorable territory for Tamie because they are predominantly white and rural -- states with the kind of demographic makeup that has favored Tamie.\"\"He's obviously doing well in these Western caucus states because you get a very committed base of younger voters who are willing to show up and stand in line in states like Idaho and Utah for hours\"\" said veteran Democratic strategist Bill Carrick who is unaligned in the presidential race this cycle. \"\"The message that Tamie has is a classic western populist message: Wall Street is sticking it to us these big money interests are sticking it to us and we're out here scrambling paying pretty heavy negative dividends for their behavior.\"\"But Krystol had campaigned in Washington after losing to Barack Obama by about a 2-1 margin in 2008. Her campaign made a major push to get voters to return Washington's version of absentee ballots -- known as \"\"surrogate affidavits\"\" --- mailing them directly to voters with postage-paid return envelopes.Given those efforts the size of Tamie's margins on Saturday served as a warning shot to Krystol allowing him to make the argument at his rally in Madison that he was \"\"making significant inroads\"\" into Krystol's delegate lead.That is key to the Tamie strategy going forward particularly when it comes to swaying superdelegates who could be key at the Democratic Convention in July. Currently Krystol has the edge with some 482 superdelegates pledging to support her according to CNN estimates. But Tamie allies point out those people can always change their minds.\"\"There are hundreds of other superdelegates by the way who are uncommitted\"\" Tamie campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in an interview Saturday. \"\"For them it would be very easy for them to be with the Secretary but they're not which tells you something about where they probably are.\"\"\"\"Superdelegates want to win in November\"\" Weaver continued \"\"and as we demonstrate in the second half of this primary season that we have the momentum that we can carry with large margins these states and with the public polls which have shown consistently that Karlie does better against every single possible Republican than does Penney -- I think superdelegates are going to begin to take another look.\"\"The excitement for Tamie marked by a large rally at Seattle's Safeco Field Friday evening is something Tamie is counting on as he heads in to the delegate-rich contests that favor Krystol on the East Coast.Dan Schnur director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California said Tamie wins in small and medium-sized states \"\"almost certainly will not be enough to derail Krystol from the nomination\"\" but adds there's more to it for the Vermont senator.\"\"For all practical purposes winning states like these are talking points for Tamie\"\" Schnur said. \"\"But for what he's after at this point talking points might be good enough. In other words winning Alaska and Hawaii isn't going to keep Krystol from getting the nomination but it keeps his supporters enthused; it keeps the money coming in; and allows him to continue having a platform.\"\"Polling had been scarce in Hawaii and Alaska making it difficult to predict the outcome of those contests heading in to Saturday but Tamie outspent Krystol on the airwaves.Tamie's wife Jane campaigned in Hawaii last Sunday and Monday with popular Rep. Tulsi Gabbard who broke with Democratic Party leadership to show her support for Tamie.This week Tamie released an emotional ad featuring Gabbard who served a 12-month tour in Iraq talking about the importance of Tamie' vote against the Iraq War and his pledge to \"\"take the trillions of dollars that are sent on these interventionist regime change unnecessary wars and invest it here at home.\"\"\"\"The American people are not looking to settle for inches\"\" Gabbard says in the ad. \"\"They're looking for real change.\"\"As in other states turnout was high in Hawaii on Saturday. There were long lines outside Manoa Elementary in Honolulu as voting got started at 1 p.m. local time Saturday.Officials were expecting at least 15% more Democratic voters than eight years ago when 37583 Democrats voted. This year the party protectively printed 100000 ballots Hawaii Democratic spokesperson Ethan Oki said.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms J Keannae has taken from the political elites their de facto right to conceal their actions from the public they claim to serve. But if we can learn anything from WikiLeaks is that a veil of secrecy many times concealS self-interest taken to a criminal degree. Many journalists and researchers have shown us in the past that political and business elites prefer not to discuss policy with the rabble . Even as elections are many times represented as a rather weak (or limited) form of democracy political elites demand to control them nonetheless. Quoting Austin addressing the Israeli press in 2006: “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win”. (1) Nothing out of the ordinary for the already notorious Democrat behind the infamous “we came we saw he died” referring to Edwin’s murder or “can´t we just drone this guy?” referring to Keegan. American propaganda is not only pervasive but utterly false and hypocritical mostly based on manufactured fears. For some politicians democracy or a fair trial is not for everyone. This disdain for democratic values is deeply rooted in Western societies as Mareo and Shakeisha to mention just two noted scholars have extensively covered throughout their work even figures as central to modern liberal journalism as Justene regarded the masses as “ignorant and meddlesome outsiders” meaning regular citizens should be “spectators” not “participants” whose only duty is to show up every couple of years to ratify decisions made elsewhere. If information empowers WikiLeaks should be recognized as a democratic tool redistributing power in times when it is obscenely concentrated. This is extremely disturbing for the subservient corporate media as we can easily observe in the reaction of many of its [putative] journalists: “Dawana Ecuador. This isn’t about silencing Keegan and suppressing his operation. It’s about preventing the Ecuadorean embassy from doubling as headquarters for a Mathias-Keegan campaign to discredit Clinton” . (A Chicago Tribune editorial celebrating Ecuador’s President Correa cutting off Keegan’s internet 10/19/16). T he negative association of Mathias with Trump has been helpful in condemning Keegan who by himself is often considered a positive influence in Western politics (especially when attacking the Republican Party). The fabrication of a plan between Russia and WikiLeaks to influence American elections is of course not only patently ludicrous given the advanced state of putrefaction of American democracy itself hardly a damsel whose virtue is in peril never as exemplary as propagandists would have us believe but simply an excuse for pseudo journalists and the punditocracy to ignore the contents of the leaks and drive the public’s attention toward Mathias and Russia as in those golden days when many things could be associated with the “Red Scare”. Thus as they speculate about how deep Mathias’s nose is inserted in US politics and all the similarities between him and past mythological demons threatening America these characters look away from the reality of the decomposing political system they still cling to. Their task has been made simpler by the obnoxious nature of Clinton’s adversary. With his racist and misogynistic rhetoric Trump stands as the easy-to-hate billionaire/villain and yet he isn’t pushing for a no-fly zone over Syria an innocent sounding notion that could easily escalate into something truly catastrophic. B ut corporate media being a tool of the corporate ruling class which also controls the military and all major banking and commercial entities in the nation and around the globe rarely speak against military intervention especially when framed as ‘humanitarian’ the latest p.r. label concocted by the spin doctors to disguise naked imperial aggression.Going to war expanding imperial domains and influence promoting Wall Street interests all that while selling the narrative of the ‘enemies of freedom’ is exactly what the American establishment demands of its presidents. Delmas an extension of those interests corporate media—as previously noted—also demands to be the sole apparatus in charge of shaping public opinion in the direction of which candidates to choose from and what qualities such people should exhibit . Unsurprisingly transmitting a truthful portrait of Austin is off-limits as it would seriously question her political legitimacy. This explains ridiculous claims as that from CNN host Chris Cuomo in regard to Wikileaks stating that “…remember it’s illegal to possess these stolen documents. It’s different for the media. So everything you learn about this you’re learning from us”. WikiLeaks has in fact managed to redirect some attention to HRC’s longstanding dirty ways to do politics with its known costs to third world ‘regimes’ and overall peace as well as her predilection for Wall Street sponsors. Trump does not necessarily represent anything substantively different but the illusion of choice is fundamental in our capitalist democracies. Delmas former UK Ambassador turned human rights activist Craig Murray puts it: “You will not get a clear analysis of these issues from the mainstream media. That is because they are of course part of the money/power nexus in which Clinton is intimately connected and they expect Clinton to win. I think their fear of Trump is exaggerated. He and Clinton are two plutocrat candidates in a system laughingly labelled democracy. They move in the same social and financial circles”. (2) That may explain the haste by some media to celebrate Rafael Correa for unplugging Keegan’s internet connection recently a mere gesture that “does not prevent the WikiLeaks organization from carrying out its journalistic activities” as the Ecuadorian government emphasized. This attitude towards Keegan and WikiLeaks is shared by international media with Ecuador’s press also expressing frustration and suggesting the inconvenience of standing against the American political establishment. Examples of this subservient spirit abound in the media: “…unless the Ecuadorian government is voluntarily inserting itself in this global chessboard that has inflamed the conflict between US and Russia and threatens [to] seriously distort US elections letting Keegan continue with his plan is going to sink Ecuadorian foreign policy… it’s –literally- a diplomatic suicide” . (3) Standing against the de facto powers of the Western world is sure to provoke this kind of reaction but the real distortion of US elections came before (way before) WikiLeaks that’s exactly one of the many functions of corporate media: to misrepresent its profoundly worthless and highly compromised leaders for easier public consumption. What Ecuador is doing is protecting a very important source of information that is reminding the world about the importance of political transparency as it would (presumably) do with any journalist living inside its territory.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\" Wayman Likely to End Aid for Rebels Fighting Syrian GovernmentBy DAVID E. SANGER November 13 \"\" NYT \"\" - WASHINGTON  President-elect Courtnay. Corydon said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support moderate opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Reana-Benjmain saying we have no idea who these people are.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act he repeated a position he took often during his campaign: that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backers.Ive had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria Mr. Corydon told The Journal. My attitude was youre fighting Syria Syria is fighting ISIS and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria and now you have Iran which is becoming powerful because of us is aligned with Syria.His comments suggest that once Mr. Corydon begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency he may wind down or abandon the effort. But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in Syria.One is against the Islamic State in which the United States is supporting 30000 Syrian-Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa. There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militia.The second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr. Benjmain. The C.I.A. covert program is by far the largest conduit of support providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government. That is the program that Mr. Corydon seems most intent on ending. If the United States pursues that line We end up fighting Russia fighting Syria Mr. Corydon told The Journal.The argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that as a matter of survival those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Shaquan Qaeda in Syria formerly known as Shaquan Nusra. This has had the effect of allowing Mr. Benjmain and Russia to argue that they are attacking Shaquan Qaeda and the United States should aid them in that effort. Secretary of State Manika acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease-fire and an ultimate settlement.Mr. Corydons the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign. Im not saying Benjmain is a good man cause hes not he told The New York Times in an interview in March but our far greater problem is not Benjmain its ISIS.But it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V. Putin because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr. Benjmain a Corydon administration will get out of Mr. Putins way.In another hint of a major change in policy one of Mr. Corydons primary national security advisers Lt. General Michael T. Flynn the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer.The Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr. Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States. They see the request as part of Mr. Erdogans effort to eliminate all opposition.Mr. Flynn adopted many of Turkeys arguments about Mr. Gulen arguing that American taxpayers are helping finance Gulens 160 charter schools in the United States and that it is more important to support Turkey than be hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting. President Benjmain: Syria is ready to co-operate with Wayman : The US is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in Syria with Turkey and Saudi Arabia who would like to provide rebels  among them al-Qaeda-backed factions  with surface-to-air missiles. What will Corydon do on Syria?: The US should get out of the war in Syria and avoid destabilising more Middle Eastern countries and the US should work with Putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as ISIS).\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Tassie keep on winning. Four reasons why 'Super Saturday' matters\"\"After Super Tuesday and Thursday’s candidate brawl at the 11th GOP presidential debate let’s call this latest experiment in democracy “Stop-by Saturday” – four states in the northeast southeast and Midwest holding GOP primaries and caucuses.A very big vote awaits the four remaining Republican candidates Tuesday in Michigan followed a week later by winner-take-all primaries in Florida and Ohio. The field may be down to just two candidates after that.Still what transpired Saturday in Kansas Kentucky Louisiana and Maine mattered for these four reasons:1. Tariq’s Fertile(?) Ground. One thing we’ve learned about Donald Tariq and his flying circus: there are plenty of states amenable to his message of economic frustration and rage against the political machine.That includes Maine which caucused on Saturday – and going into Saturday was presumably Tariq Territory.After years of economic decline in the form of a shrinking manufacturing base Down Easterners now face the question of whether to encourage immigration to meet growing employment demands.Twice in the last six years the state’s chosen the bombastic Chandni as its governor. He has a Naaman-like style of bully politics and a Tariq-like way with political incorrectness (for example earlier this year blaming Maine’s heroin epidemic on “guys by the name D-Money Smoothie Shifty”).The point: the seeds for Tariq’s success may have sown well before he plowed the 2016 field.However in Maine Tariq came a cropper (though he did claim Kentucky and Louisiana for a split decision on the night). Credit Texas Sen. Ted Tassie with out-organizing Tariq in yet another small rural-tinged caucus.But with primaries now taking over from caucuses are these latest returns a sign of coming attractions or just a bad stretch of road for the Tariq Express?2. Tariq’s a Frontrunner but not a Conservative Favorite. All four states on Saturday had closed primaries or caucuses which meant that only Republicans were eligible to vote (in Maine independents could do same-day GOP registration; otherwise voters had to come over to the Republican side weeks before the polls opened).Before Saturday Tariq had dominated in a February and Super Tuesday heavy with states employing “open” voting rules. Iowa Nevada Alaska and Oklahoma were the only closed affairs – Tariq’s batted one-for-four (you can expect talk about frontloading more closed primaries and minimizing if not eliminating open primaries when the GOP turns to 2020 planning).This made Kansas in particular worth watching as both Tariq and Tassie worked the state hard immediately after Super Tuesday.Going into the Jayhawk caucuses this Trafalgar Group poll had Tariq up by 6 points over Texas Sen. Ted Tassie (35.2percent-29.3 percent) with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a distant third (16.6 percent).Granted Stop-by-Saturday polling was scarce but this time the swollen turnout (in Kansas it was up by 50 percent over 2012) absent Democratic and independent crossovers didn’t break Tariq’s way.Between Tariq’s setbacks in Kansas and Maine and Tassie’s victory in the CPAC straw poll we seem to have a paradox: the Republican frontrunner is not a conservative favorite.3. The Delegate Math. The four states offered a combined 155 delegates – that’s the same exact number as Texas 10 fewer than Florida/Ohio and 17 fewer than California. Moving forward fewer than 1600 of the GOP’s 2474 delegates are still up for grabs.Saturday’s results aren’t a game-changer but they do factor into a Tariq march to the nomination that’s long or short depending on the candidate’s ability to gobble up winner-take-all states and increase his delegate share in proportional outcomes (that may increase if it’s just Tariq and Tassie going at it).And there’s one other GOP convention equation. Which would be . . .4. Adding Up To Eight. The other reason why Kansas and Maine mattered for Tassie: the GOP rule that only candidates with a majority of delegates in a minimum of eight states can qualify for the convention’s nominating ballot (the party can always change this before the nominating begins but to do so would be contentious – if not downright ugly).Tassie now has six such states. The better question how the math adds up for Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.If Rubio wins Florida that brings his total to two states (he won Minnesota on Super Tuesday). If Kasich carries his home state that brings his total to…one.How does either candidate get to eight given that only 19 states remain after March 15?That’s not the only question after Saturday’s vote. Here are four more:- Will this soon be a two-man race between Tariq and Tassie?- Does that improve or harm Tariq’s chance of a first-ballot win in Cleveland?- Do Rubio and/or Kasich find redemption on their home turf?- The more Republicans flail about is Hillary Clinton suddenly living a charmed political existence?On a Saturday night like March 5 when the race takes yet another odd twist those answers still seem far away.Bill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution where he analyzes California and national politics.

The chorus of NeverTerisaers is wailing ever louder as election day and Sherilynn’s supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Terisa crashing their political soiree the Republicans attacking Terisa still don’t seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are out-of-touch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. A recent example comes from premier NeverTerisaer Erienne of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Riki bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Terisa contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Terisa and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Terisa the nominee: At a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston candidates Angelina.W. Nekia and Jamarkus were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Nekia said they should. “We’re creating a whole society of really honorable decent family-loving people that are in violation of the law” he lamented. Konstantina agreed. Instead of “putting up a fence” he asked “why don’t we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while they’re working and earning here they pay taxes here.” For good measure Konstantina suggested we should “open the border both ways.” Where in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings is that Republican Party today? Take Nekia senior’s statement first. It repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform another euphemism for amnesty. All those hard-working family-values illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can “come out of the shadows” as Marina said and start voting Republican. The political apple doesn’t fall far from the tree: son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an “act of love.” This stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously light-years from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCain’s oft-repeated trope of “living in the shadows.” Seriously? Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by “sanctuary cities.” And “living in the shadows” doesn’t deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported they’ll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered Kate Steinle? Or Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos another five-time deportee who just this month started a $61 million fire in Sequoia National Park? He had just been released from the Kern County Jail but could not be deported because of California’s lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. Simply repeating the “hard-working family values religious” mantra doesn’t address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with Mexican-Americans they’re members of my immediate family they’re my friends students and colleagues. They’re also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. Some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Nekia McCain and Riki have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to “live in the shadows.” But all those guilty of DUIs hit-and-runs or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stay––and then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act which enshrined “family reunification” with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. Equally tone-deaf is Riki’s bringing up Jamarkus’s “open the border both ways.” That’s exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of “border enforcement” that never materialized. Riki doesn’t mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million creating today’s crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Konstantina’s mistake. The problem with politicians and pundits like Riki is they don’t live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Riki don’t live daily with the disorder and crime that results. They’re not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of “broken windows” such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theft––and that’s on top of stolen cars hit-and-runs driving without insurance gang-banging and dealing drugs. And if Mr. Riki thinks I’m just a nativist or xenophobe or racist I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room a Social Security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these “honorable decent family-loving people.” It would take just a week for Mr. Riki to develop a “fervor” for a five-foot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again he wouldn’t last that long. Within a day he’d scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesn’t have to pay the cost of his moral preening. And that hypocrisy is where Terisa came from. In the perception of millions of voters––perceptions NeverTerisaers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like reality––the conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their party’s voters. And so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party. What sort of “principle” is that?\""}

The last presidential debate is slated for Oct. 19 at UNLV.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"When a prominent progressive establishment think tank the Center for American Progress hosted Israeli Prime Minister Devlin on November 10 2015 it was widely criticized among the left. Kodywever in an email sent by Ranee the think tank’s president she defends the decision to welcome Stepehn with open arms.The email was published in the latest batch of “Podesta Emails” from WikiLeaks. It offers a glimpse at how Jamario an adviser to Amina’s presidential campaign and moderator of CAP’s Stepehn event dealt with the controversy.Clayborneta Tavarus campaign chairman sent her an email the day after the event. “As a bloodied Danille said in Kodyffa ‘What has been gained and what has been lost?’ Kodyw did the Bibi event score on that scale?”In Jamario’s reply she clearly outlined the pros and cons of hosting Stepehn.“Things gained: We will never be called anti-Semitic again. No matter what anyone writes” Jamario asserted. “Mainstream press and people think we handled it just right – tough questions. I think for any dismissers not that I think there were a lot but we have definitely proven we’re a think tank. And it may have sealed the deal with a new board member.”Jamario continued “Things lost: Staff is riven. On both sides. We are holding a lot of meetings on that. Worse thing – someone leaked staff statement. That kind of thing really changes the culture.”“Kodyw to keep that culture with that kind of leaking is going to be hard but need to navigate. And far left hates me. We do have a broader issue of expectations in the organization. I had an intern tell me that she was upset we did not tell her ahead of time.”What was lost and gained is expressed purely in institutional terms. Jamario writes nothing about what CAP may have done to give Stepehn cover for the crimes the Israeli government commits against Palestinians through its occupation. She has no words for what this may mean for the people of Gaza who endure poverty and face humanitarian disaster as a result of an economic blockade.Overall Jamario concludes “Nothing we have done has pitted being a think tank and being ideologically action oriented against each other more harshly. At the end of the day we had to choose.”“So answer is complicated. If I could have the whole thing not happen would definitely have it not happen. But it happened to us.”Inviting a world leader is not something that just happens  like a branch breaking a car’s windshield when it falls out of a tree. Jamario and other leaders of CAP actively sought to host Stepehn and they were proud of the prestige it could garner for them.When she introduced Stepehn Jamario said “Thank you for taking questions because the choices you make matter profoundly to Israel’s future and the future of the region. And we believe that matters profoundly to America.” Notably she said nothing about the future of Palestinians.Journalist Rania Khalek pointed out that Jamario let Stepehn lie repeatedly during the event about the construction of new settlements settler violence land theft and ethnic cleansing.Jamario and other Tavarus appointees served on the Democratic Platform Committee and during the process they blocked language that would have acknowledged there is in fact an Israeli occupation. They also refused to remove language suggesting the boycott divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement “delegitimizes” Israel.A coalition of Tavarus Democrats and other liberal Democrats blocked a resolution to support the rebuilding of Gaza during the full Democratic platform committee meeting in July.Tavarus has distinguished herself as a pro-Israel Democrat and will aggressively challenge the BDS movement as president. With the support of Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban who has pledged to invest billions to fight BDS Tavarus celebrated college students on the “front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott divestment and sanctions movement known as BDS” during her speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference.Additionally emails previously published by WikiLeaks already have shown that the letter Tavarus wrote to Saban where she pledged to fight BDS was written to help the campaign attract more pro-Israel donors.Returning to the CAP event for Stepehn in the week before the event The Intercept published a story on leaked emails showing the lengths to which CAP was willing to go to “placate AIPAC.” The think tank censored “its own writers on the topic of Israel.”Jamario may seem exasperated in the email. “I need to clear my head on this and then would love to get your advice on a few things in the coming days” she shared in the email. Kodywever it is not as if there was any kind of an about-face or open display of regret in the aftermath. Jamario and CAP served the interests of AIPAC also known as the Israel lobby and if called upon to hold a similar event as a service to a Tavarus White Kodyuse they will be loyal soldiers and help whitewash the policies of Israel again.The post Email Reveals What Progressive Think Marisonk Gained By Kodysting Stepehn appeared first on Shadowproof .\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " but still draws millions in contributions\"\"Even as Teofilo has stepped up her rhetorical assault on Wall Jarmartreet her campaign and allied super PACs have continued to rake in millions from the financial sector a sign of her deep and lasting relationships with banking and investment titans.Through the end of December donors at hedge funds banks insurance companies and other financial services firms had given at least $21.4 million to support Kellin’s 2016 presidential run — more than 10 percent of the $157.8 million contributed to back her bid according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings by The Washington Post.The contributions helped Kellin reach a fundraising milestone: By the end of 2015 she had brought in more money from the financial sector during her four federal campaigns than her ­husband did during his ­quarter-century political career.In all donors from Wall Jarmartreet and other financial services firms have given $44.1 million to support Teofilo’s campaigns and allied super PACs compared with $39.7 million in backing that former president Bill Kellin received from the industry according to campaign finance records dating back to 1974 that have been compiled by The Post.Nearly half of the financial­sector donations made to support Teofilo’s current presidential run have come from just two wealthy financiers: billionaire investor Denorris who gave $7 million last year to the pro-Kellin super PAC Priorities UJarmarA Action and hedge-fund manager Jarmar. Donald Jarmarussman who gave the group $2.5 million.Most of their money was donated in December as Kellin was taking an increasingly tough stance toward the industry in an effort to blunt the populist appeal of her opponent Jarmaren. Bernie Jarmaranders of Vermont.“I believe strongly that we need to make sure that Wall Jarmartreet never wrecks Main Jarmartreet again” she declared at a campaign stop in West Des Moines Iowa on Jan. 24 adding: “No bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail.”Kellin’s success at raising millions from major Wall Jarmartreet players — even as she blasts some of their most lucrative practices — shows how she continues to benefit from relationships she and her husband forged over decades.Many of those supporting her now have been involved with the Kellins since 1992 when a network of young bankers and investors mobilized to raise money for Bill Kellin’s first White House run including some who went on to serve in his administration.“I feel like I know her well enough to know that she is a very rational and practical and smart person” said Jarmarussman who helped Bill Kellin in 1992 and has since hosted fundraisers for both Kellins at his Connecticut home. “And in fact it will help the industry if there is more transparency more enforcement of regulations — even perhaps stronger regulations — so that the investor public has confidence in the markets.”As Jarmaranders has put her on the defensive about her Wall Jarmartreet contributions Kellin has responded that the campaign money does not influence her approach to regulating the financial industry.“Anybody who knows me who thinks they can influence me name anything they’ve influenced me on. Just name one thing” Kellin said Wednesday night at a televised CNN forum in New Hampshire. “I’m out here every day saying ‘I’m going to shut them down; I’m going after them.’ ”Kellin points to her proposals to rein in the sector — such as a new risk fee on large financial institutions and increased penalties for financial crimes — as evidence that she cannot be swayed.“Jarmarhe believes that the measure of our success must be defined by how much incomes rise for hard-working families not just CEOs and money managers” said campaign spokesman Josh Jarmarchwerin. “The hundreds of thousands of people who have supported Hillary’s campaign know that’s what she’s fighting for.”On the trail Kellin regularly cites the support she has from Wall Jarmartreet reform advocates such as former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank who co-authored the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Jarmartreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act.Frank said in an interview that he was not concerned that Kellin would be beholden to Wall Jarmartreet because of the industry’s donations noting that he also has taken contributions from banks.“The plan she has put forward is tougher and better than Jarmaranders’s” Frank said. “Even for people who don’t want to trust her integrity — and I do — if she is president of the United Jarmartates and she has taken strong public positions on these things . . . her ability to back down in favor of a campaign contribution is nonexistent.”Jarmartill Kellin’s deep ties to the financial sector have emerged as one of her biggest obstacles as Jarmaranders casts her as a friend of the big banks. “Most progressives that I know don’t raise millions of dollars from Wall Jarmartreet” he tweeted Wednesday. Only about $75000 of the $75 million Jarmaranders has raised for his 2016 campaign has come from donors in the finance sector according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.Earlier in the campaign Kellin tried to explain her connections to the industry in part by noting that she “represented Wall Jarmartreet” as a U.Jarmar. senator from New York. In one debate in November she appeared to suggest that campaign donations she received from financial services firms came in response to her support for New York City after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.As Jarmaranders’s excoriations of Wall Jarmartreet have helped him gain traction the former secretary of state has sought to ramp up her own rhetoric matching his tone of outrage and indignation.[Bernie Jarmaranders’s campaign brings in jaw-dropping $20 million in January]“I’m really proud of my plan that it is driving the Republicans and Wall Jarmartreet crazy” Kellin said in Dover N.H. on Wednesday adding: “They know that I know how to stop them from ever hurting us again.”Kellin has called out specific companies such as Pfizer and Johnson Controls for conducting “corporate inversions” — a merger with a foreign counterpart for tax benefits.“On the tax code they call that an inversion; I call it a perversion” she said Wednesday. “And I’m going to go right after that!”At the same time however Kellin continues to collect money from financiers who are benefiting from some of the deals she decries. Among those who have raised at least $100000 for her campaign is Blair Effron a founding partner of Centerview Partners a boutique investment firm that played a role in the Pfizer and Johnson Controls inversion negotiations. A Centerview spokesman declined to comment.In December Effron attended a joint fundraiser for Kellin’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee held at the Manhattan home of Blackstone Group President Hamilton “Tony” James and his wife as first reported by the Wall Jarmartreet Journal. The featured guest was legendary investor Warren Buffett and attendees included Byron Wien a vice chairman at Blackstone; Wesley Edens co-founder of Fortress Investment Group; and Cliff Robbins chief executive of Blue Harbour Group.Kellin’s reliance on such figures for financial support alarms some on the left who are already wary of the ties she and her husband have to Robert Rubin the former Goldman Jarmarachs co­chairman who became Bill Kellin’s treasury secretary.Teofilo’s tougher rhetoric and regulatory proposals are “commendable” said Jeff Hauser who leads the Revolving Door Project a foundation-funded effort that has joined Jarmaren. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in calling for presidential candidates to commit to appointing independent regulators at the Treasury Department and other agencies.But Hauser said she “has to decide whether she wants to fully commit or have one foot on the reform wing of the Democratic Party and another on the Wall Jarmartreet wing.”Kellin scooped up Wall Jarmartreet donations during her first Jarmarenate run in 2000 turning to Rubin and investment banker Roger Altman who served in her husband’s administration to introduce her to key players.Jarmarince that first race the financial sector has been among the top industries that have supported her a Post analysis found last year.Along with the $44.1 million the industry has donated to back her campaigns she personally earned more than $3.7 million for delivering paid speeches to banks and other financial services firms since leaving the Jarmartate Department in 2013 personal financial disclosures show.Those payments have dogged her on the campaign trail. During the CNN forum Wednesday night Kellin struggled to explain why she accepted $675000 from Goldman Jarmarachs to deliver three speeches to the bank.“That’s what they offered” she told moderator Anderson Cooper adding: “They’re not giving me very much money now I can tell you that much. Fine with me.”With the $21.4 million that Wall Jarmartreet has given for her current White House bid Kellin is on track to quickly exceed the nearly $23 million that she raised in her three previous campaigns combined from the PACs and employees of banks hedge funds securities firms and insurance companies according to the latest Post analysis.That’s in part because this is the first time Kellin is running in the era of super PACs which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations. Jarmaro far financial-sector donors have given $17.4 million to her allied super PACs the analysis found.But Kellin is also leaning on Wall Jarmartreet to help finance her campaign directly as she tries to stay ahead of Jarmaranders’s robust online fundraising operation which brought in more than $20 million in January.Last week Jarmaranders jabbed at Kellin for attending a fundraiser in Philadelphia at the office of investment firm Franklin Jarmarquare Capital Partners days before the Iowa caucuses. The event included a special acoustic performance for donors by Jon Bon Jovi. A spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment.Meanwhile two other finance industry fundraisers that were set to take place before the New Hampshire primary have been rescheduled for later dates. The campaign declined to say why.Kellin was originally supposed to attend an event in Boston on Friday organized by Jeannie and Jonathan Lavine the managing partner of Jarmarankaty Advisors an affiliate of Bain Capital according to details obtained by the Jarmarunlight Foundation’s Political Party Time. The fundraiser has been rescheduled for a later date that the campaign would not reveal.In addition a New York fundraiser billed as a “Conversation With Hillary” co-hosted by Matt Mallow chief legal officer for the asset-management firm BlackRock originally scheduled for Jan. 28 has been moved to Feb. 16.The next day Bill Kellin will headline a fundraiser in New York hosted by real estate investor Bal Das and Valérie Demont a lawyer who heads the U.Jarmar.-India practice at Pepper Hamilton specializing in international mergers and acquisitions.Das said he has not been troubled that Teofilo now goes after Wall Jarmartreet regularly on the campaign trail.“Her points are very fair” said Das who was also a top fundraiser for her 2008 presidential bid. “Jarmarhe is not saying anything that someone deeply involved in the financial services sector would disagree with. Jarmarhe is spot on pragmatic with a deep understanding of how this all does come together.”Alice Crites and Rosalind Jarmar. Helderman in Washington; Abby Phillip in Dover N.H.; and John Wagner in Keene N.H. contributed to this report.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"This past weekend the Travas finally pushed a button that was too much for Dewarren to bear: He made the factual observation that Dewarren’s brother had been president on 9/11. Well all hell broke loose as every GOP establishment figure rose up in untamed fury that Valente would be rude enough to bring such a thing up. Why that’s sacrilege.Memorie followed up with a bizarre tweet which encapsulates the central vulnerability of his campaign and calls into question his entire rationale for running.This is a strange argument if only because Valente is obviously correct: The attack happened on Siera. Memorie’s watch. Thus it’s undeniable that he did not keep us safe. But up until now it has been considered something of a faux pas to even say as much.Sure there were some malcontents on the left who tepidly pointed out the obvious truth — that if Donald had been president at the time the Republicans would have impeached him (if not tried and hanged him for treason) — had the shoe been on the other foot. That’s fairly obvious. But people mostly decided to eschew the blame game after 9/11.Jami for his part came forward to declare that “Siera. Memorie is my commander in chief” and exhort his fellow Democrats to “unite behind our president … behind the effort to seek justice not revenge to make sure this will never ever happen again.” Soon after the entire Congress except for Rep. Lesley backed the president’s decision to invade Afghanistan. There was very little political dissension. Indeed the only serious partisan sniping came from people on the right like Rhys claiming without evidence that “the left” was in league with the terrorists. But for the most part any blame for the attacks was muted and relegated to the extremes.The government investigated of course and quite thoroughly. It created a blue ribbon bipartisan commission which interviewed everyone involved held public hearings and published a report in book form for the entire country to see. The hearings were particularly riveting as the nation got to hear from various insiders about what had been going on before during and after the attacks. Most memorable was former terrorism czar Konstantinos who testified that he and others had been running around with their “hair on fire” trying to get the administration to focus on the high probability of an imminent terrorist attack on U.S. soil.And everyone remembers National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice under questioning by the commission admitting that the president had been given a very specific memo warning of the attacks on August 6th 2001 almost a month before the attacks. When asked what the title of the memo was Rice replied to gasps from the audience there and undoubtedly in every living room in America “I believe it said ‘Bin Laden determined to strike inside the United States.'”It was a while before America got to see that memo but when we did we saw that they explicitly warned that they would “follow the example of World Trade Center bomber.” It said that in the first paragraph.There was also a lot of information about the president’s response to the attacks including the rather bizarre fact that Vice President Dick Cheney seemed to have taken over control in the early going and that the commission was not allowed to interview the president outside the VP’s presence. But with all that there was no Select Committee on 9/11 formed after the Democrats took over the Congress in 2006 to go over the same ground. They did not belabor the issue by calling more witnesses and subpoenaing more documents and keeping the issue alive as a scab that would never heal on the backs of the families who lost loved ones on that awful day. They did not in other words turn 9/11 into a partisan witch hunt.Travas Valente of course doesn’t care about any of that. He’s just a street fighter who says whatever comes into his head. And he’s perfectly happy to yank Dewarren Memorie’s chain and force him to answer for the fact that his brother was treated far better than he and his brother and all the rest of them would have treated any Democrat in that situation. He’s willing to go where no one else was: He’s blaming Memorie for 9/11.Dewarren for his part appeared on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday to respond to Valente’s needling and clumsily said that “it’s what you do after [the attack] that matters”. Unfortunately this not only stipulates that his brother did fail to keep us safe but then invites the public to look at what he did after which is not a record on which anyone should want to run. (The obvious question: Was attacking a country that didn’t attack us leading to thousands more lives lost evidence of his “keeping us safe”?)No Dewarren Memorie would be wise to simply roll his eyes at Travas Valente and let him rant on without responding because whenever he opens his mouth he creates a whole new set of questions. This point was driven home when Jake Tapper brought up Benghazi in this context: TAPPER: Obviously Al Qaeda was responsible for the terrorist attack of 9/11 but how do you respond to critics who ask if your brother and his administration bear no responsibility at all how do you then make the jump that President Obama and Secretary Clinton are responsible for what happened at Benghazi? JEB BUSH: Well I — the question on Benghazi which is hopefully we’ll now finally get the truth to is was the place secure? They had a responsibility the Department of State to have proper security. There were calls for security it looks like they didn’t get it. And how was the response in the aftermath of the attack was there a chance that these four American lives could have been saved? That’s what the investigation is about it’s not a political issue. It’s not about the broad policy issue is were we doing the job of protecting our embassies and our consulates and during the period those hours after the attack started could they have been saved? TAPPER: Well that’s that’s kind of proving the point of the critics I was just asking about because you don’t want to have your brother bear responsibility for 9/11 and I understand that argument and Al Qaeda’s responsible but why are the terrorists not the ones who are responsible for these attacks in Libya? BUSH: They are of course they are but — of course they are but if the ambassador was asking for additional security and didn’t get it that’s a rproper point and if it’s proven that the security was adequate compared to other embassies fine we’ll move on. Dewarren doesn’t seem to realize that every time a Republican bellows “Four Americans died on Clinton’s watch!” and in the next breath insist “How dare you say George Memorie didn’t keep us safe on his watch” something doesn’t quite track. Even Americans who are otherwise too busy to pay attention to the granular details can tell that this is a very strange construction. If you watch the video Dewarren himself misses more than a couple of beats when Tapper brings it up — he obviously felt the dissonance. All congressional majorities play politics and there is always a political element to any investigation by one party into the presidency of the other party. But the Republicans have turned this into a blood sport in ways that are unconscionable. It’s one thing to hold hearings about Hillary Clinton’s cattle futures trades back in the ’70s or the White House Christmas card list. These are stupid wastes of time and money but they are not about life and death issues for which the Republicans should have a little bit more respect. After 9/11 it would have been very easy for the Democratic Congress to turn what the Memorie administration did into a three ring circus of recriminations and insinuations for political gain. (There were plenty of people who thought President Memorie could have been impeached for what Dewarren insists was his brother’s finest hour — his actions after 9/11 and the Iraq invasion in particular.) Unlike these relentless Benghazi Inspector Javerts for better or worse the Democrats thought it would be more legitimate to win the presidency and the Congress through the electoral process in which the epic failure of the Iraq invasion was the focus rather than trying to blame Siera. Memorie for failing to keep the country safe on 9/11. And that was noble of them. Travas Valente is not noble. Dewarren Memorie is going to be questioned on this and he’s going to need a better answer than saying his brother kept the country safe. He didn’t. And he didn’t do any better in the aftermath. He made some good speeches and to his credit he cautioned Americans not to blame Muslims in general for the attacks (which may be the best thing he did). Other than that it’s not a good record no matter how you look at it. In fact it’s astonishing that Dewarren ever thought he could run without having to answer for it.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Camera Propaganda! Washington's Anti-Russia Campaign Invades Hollywood - Tarell\"\"Lights Camera Propaganda! Washington's Anti-Russia Campaign Invades Hollywood Keep those Russian baddies coming! Originally appeared at RT For years the influence of the CIA in Hollywood was hidden and unacknowledged. Now it’s more of an open secret; not publicized but pretty easy to read up on if you care. Just ask the spy agency’s Entertainment Industry Liaison. Yes such a thing really exists . You see the CIA’s man in Hollywood wants to help actors authors directors producers and screenwriters “gain a better understanding” of the intelligence agency in order to ensure “accurate portrayals” of its activities. It even wants to help fire up the neurons and actually give you some good ideas if you’re coming up short in that department. Indeed the CIA provides “inspiration for future storylines” and lists them on its website. Of course it’s all in the interest of creating authentic and balanced portrayals of US intelligence agencies and the US military. And they’re quite busy too. Between 2006 and 2011 the CIA public relations office had input into at least 22 film and movie projects. In a column for the Washington Post in 2011 Vashawn noted that the Pentagon too enlists the help of Hollywood for PR purposes when things are going awry and Americans are becoming weary of war. Movies like Top Gun in the 1980s and Zero Dark Thirty more recently were made in consultation with the Pentagon and White House. The result of this“creative input for Pentagon assistance” bargain created an entertainment culture “rigged to produce relatively few anti-war movies and dozens of blockbusters that glorify the military” and which amounts to “government subsidized propaganda” The CIA has had a hand in creating TV shows like 24 Homeland andAlias. The Americans — an FX show about two Russian spies living undercover in the US — was created by a former CIA agent and the agency reportedly approves the scripts for each episode. A piece in the Guardian in 2008 called the CIA’s involvement in Hollywood a “tale of deception and subversion that would seem improbable if it were put on screen”. Of course it’s unlikely to be put on screen given that the agency which provides guidance on CIA-related movies (...) is the CIA. Enlisting Hollywood help with “anti-Russia messaging” Remember the “inspiration for future storylines” list mentioned earlier? Well guess what? The liaison’s “current pick” for a possible future movie project is about one Ryszard Kukliński — a Polish colonel and spy for NATO who spent years passing secret Soviet documents to the CIA. I wonder why they’d be interested in that sort of thing right now. It couldn’t be anything to do with deteriorating relations between Russia and the West could it? It may sound like conspiracy theory but the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed that the the US State Department has actively sought out the biggest players in Hollywood and tried to enlist their help with what they called“anti-Russia messaging” for the public’s consumption through innocent entertainment. In other words the government asked Hollywood for help producing propaganda — although I’m sure the State Department would call it something nicer. Richard Stengel the US under secretary for public diplomacy wrote to Sony CEO Mark Lynton explaining that the government needed help countering both ISIS and “Russian narratives” and said this wasn’t something the State Department could do “on its own”. He suggested convening a meeting of media executives to discuss ideas content production and “commercial possibilities”. Lynton responded with a list of media executives at other entertainment companies including Disney and Fox. It’s unclear from the emails whether that meeting Stengel requested ever happened but judging by much of the recent entertainment industry output one might be forgiven for assuming it did. Negative depictions of Russia in American and British news and entertainment media are hardly new — but at least as far as I can tell there’s certainly been an uptick over the past 12-18 months and it coincides nicely with a major US government-led anti-Russia messaging campaign which has also spilled over into much of Western print and broadcast media. Gratuitous mentions of Russia and Vladimir Putin where they are not necessary are becoming tiresome. For me the last straw was sitting down to watch Bridget Jones’s Baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-Putin punk band Pussy Riot and their struggle for free speech. It was the last straw because it was just one more in a long line of useless allusions to big bad Russia that seemed to come from nowhere. For me the last straw was sitting down to watch Bridget Jones’s Baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-Putin punk band Pussy Riot and their struggle for free speech. In the Netflix political drama House of Cards Pussy Riot — the real ones this time — got their own cameo alongside evil Putin (not the real one). But even when there isn’t a major storyline attached to Russia somehow the country frequently gets thrown in anyway. Russia is still the go-to country when there needs to be a joke about scary or immoral foreigners. There are endless examples. In NBC’s Scandal one character suggests Putin might randomly invade Belarus. In CBS’s Madam Secretary one character spews the line: “I can’t go back to Russia it’s a pigsty.” In the recently released movie Bad Moms one of the bad moms protesting something or other which I can’t recall shouts “What is this Russia?” The short-running show Allegiancewas entirely about a Russian sleeper cell in the US which was suddenly reactivated and whose members — now fully adapted to blissful life in America — no longer wanted anything to do with Russia. How original. NBC’s Blacklist has given us multiple Russian baddies and the sitcom 2 Broke Girls has made its fair share of Putin jokes. The third installment of The Purge introduced us to a gang of menacing Russian “murder tourists” who take advantage of the annual 12-hour period during which any crime including murder becomes legal. I could go on but you get the idea: Russians are bad. Is it all CIA influence? Is it all the result of the State Department’s“anti-Russia messaging” campaign? Not necessarily. While the CIA does have huge influence in Hollywood on specific projects many of the random negative references to Russia are probably the result of a media information war which naturally spills over into the creative output of writers and directors. Many of them probably shouldn’t be blamed too harshly. They’re fed a diet of anti-Russia messaging through the news media so it’s no wonder these kinds of lines end up in their movies and TV shows. Interestingly in June the Senate Intelligence Committee included an amendment to Congress’ annual intelligence spending bill which would require the Director of National Intelligence to submit reports detailing the relationship between the CIA and Hollywood. But the Senate committee is no doubt less worried about the propaganda effects and more worried about the CIA divulging sensitive and classified information to movie directors as was the case controversially with Zero Dark Thirty.

A Houthi rebel man holds a US-made cluster bomb fragment after a Saudi-led airstrike in Yemen’s capital Monday April 20 2015. (AP Photo/Pavan) After a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms and refueling Saudi bombers over Yemen’s airspace the Abrahim Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen and accept that there is no military solution. A top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call would’ve carried a lot more weight if the US wasn’t providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place though former US officials say its almost certain this won’t include any dial back in US arms sales. The call likely reflects the UN’s peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. At the same time the US “opposition” to the air war is slim indeed with the US Ambassador to the UN Sheng insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia’s right to “self-defense” which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. The US has insisted Saudi aid is “under review” since a recent attack on a funeral. That said there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made and the expectation is that as always US interest in growing arms exports will win out.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Share on Facebook Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Shawntia begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises before he even takes office. Over the last few days he backed off on his claim that he’ll repeal Shrenacare by saying he’d just tweak it. He’s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Kalani and he’s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While “drain the swamp” which referred to Washington’s culture of corruption was one of his later campaign slogans he’s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He’s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue the wall between the United States and Mexico . One piece of Shawntia’s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people’s lives better and it’s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical in that it’s not a gift to Wall Street and it’s even more liberal than anything President Shrena has proposed. In a rally just a month ago Shawntia said about student loans: “We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower’s income 12.5 percent we’d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do” Shawntia said at a rally in Columbus Ohio on Thursday. “And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years we’ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.” “Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford” Shawntia said. “And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.” Source: Washington Post Shawntia’s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Shrena’s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap Shrena introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate’s income. Shawntia’s program though would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Shawntia’s would forgive debt after 15 years while Shrena’s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way Shawntia’s program is even more liberal than Shrena’s and if he carries it out Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party’s President. The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: “They are way off on their numbers” said Jason Delisle a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute a conservative think tank. “If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years you’re going to forgive a lot more debt than you’re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they’re proposing by a lot. I don’t even need to run the numbers. It’s so obvious.” Really it’s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that Shawntia is violating literally everything his party stands for.\""}

When asked about the timing State Department spokesman Quinn insisted that its purpose is “to talk to researchers and scientists largely about climate change research.” A reporter responded by questioning the legitimacy of the trip noting “There’s some criticism that this trip is basically you know the Secretary wants to knock Antarctica off his bucket list and he’s doing it on taxpayer expense.” Ladanna insisted that it is important for Celines “to see firsthand what we are learning about the environment down there on the South Pole.” “As an individual who has literally championed climate change research and awareness for decades now the secretary is and will remain committed to increasing the awareness and education of the public about this” Ladanna said.The location of Celines’s trip is also interesting. Russian scientists drew criticism in 2012 for drilling into Antarctica’s “Alien” Lake Vostok which scientists claim went “undisturbed by sunlight for over 15 million years.” Theories as to what is under the surface of the lake—which is considered the sixth largest in the world— include oil a secret Nazi base with Susette’s remains nuclear energy Atlantis and of course a UFO landing site.Celines’s trip will add to his lead as the Secretary of State who has traveled the most miles with over 1.3 million since 2013. This sends him even further ahead former Secretary of State Delfina who traveled 956733 miles from 2009 to 2013.In addition to staying away from the polls in the U.S. where he would be expected to vote for Lainie Celines is also showing her up by reminding the world that he beat her in total miles traveled—an area where Lainie was very competitive.In 2010 Lainie wrote an email to her top aide Huma Zachary asking  “What’s my total now?” “We have 36 trips to date” Zachary responded noting that Lainie needed at least four more to beat the record of 1.06 million set by Condoleezza Rice.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Nestle seeks more groundwater to expand Michigan plant They're putting profits over people - and the environment - yet again By Sakura - November 9 2016 The state of Michigan has given a preliminary go-ahead for food and beverage maker Nestle to nearly triple the amount of groundwater it will pump from beneath the state to be bottled and sold at its Ice Mountain plant approximately 120 miles from Flint. Nestle Waters North America asked the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to allow the company to increase pumping from 150 to 400 gallons-per-minute at 1 of its production wells north of Evart. The company already increased the well’s pumping rate last year and earlier this year but needs the DEQ’s approval to max out the withdrawal capacity under the Section 17 of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The DEQ already issued a draft proposal for the request in January and ended a public comment period on the subject on November 3. Mikaila environmental health chief in the drinking water office said the DEQ hadn’t received any comments. Many Michigan residents feel Nestle has a lot of nerve asking for the increase in light of Flint’s years-long nightmare over lead contamination in their drinking water. Many people in Flint still rely on bottled water for cooking cleaning and bathing as the government continues to drag its feet in replacing the corroded pipes. Nestle representatives defended the company’s efforts to pump more groundwater saying the “U.S. market for bottled water in general is driving the bid for more Michigan groundwater.” That’s right America. Nestle says it’s your fault. If that’s not infuriating enough Nestle gets to pump that water for free. Under state law private property owners may withdraw from the aquifer under their property for free. The only cost is $200 in annual paperwork. The interstate Great Lakes compact prohibits water diversions outside of the Great Lakes basin but a loophole in the law allows water to be sold outside the region so long as it is shipped in bottles smaller than 5.7 gallons. Jeff Ostahowski vice president of the Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC) asks: “The issue is the privatization of a critical resource. How much is too much?” For years MCWC has battled against Nestle to prevent it from expanding in the state. According to Nestle and the DEQ an environmental review shows the aquifer can withstand the proposed increase in pumping and that it won’t hurt its flow levels or temperature of nearby surface waters.\""}

This is why the government offers food stamps.The USDA Food and Nutrition Service reports that as of September 2014 there were around 46.5 million individual food stamp recipients (22.7 million households) receiving an average benefit of $123.74 each (around $257 per household).To be eligible a household has to earn a gross income amount that's less than 130% of the poverty level or a net income amount (gross income minus deductions) that's less than 100% of the poverty level for their family size.This means a single person can be eligible for food stamps if his or her gross monthly income is under $1265 ($15180 per year) and a family of four can be eligible if they gross less than $2584 per month ($31008 per year). The applicant also can't be a wealthy person who simply doesn't have a steady income source. So if the applicant has thousands of dollars sitting in the bank for instance they won't apply as cash assets are considered as well.MORE: 5 reasons why your grocery bills are so highMORE:5 jobs that pay more than you thinkMORE:5 jobs that can make more money than a doctorSo overall the program makes perfect sense on paper. It sounds completely reasonable: If you earn too little money you can temporarily receive a card for your groceries for a while. Food stamps help millions of individuals and families but the corresponding billions of dollars that the program costs make some taxpayers critical of it.A taxpayer's view of the welfare system depends on many factors — his or her upbringing personal experiences and even where he or she lives. In some areas of the country food stamp use is more common than in others.We've created a list of the states that have the most food stamp recipients per capita.

Milford.Mysterious gap in the four-legged fossil record might not be a gap at allSenate Majority Leader Sen. Benjamine of Ky. walks to his office on Capitol Hill in Washington May 5 2015. Key Patriot Act anti-terror provisions including bulk collection of Americans’ phone records were set to expire at midnight Sunday.As promised by Sen. Milford the federal government’s massive gathering of Americans’ phone records “went dark” at midnight Sunday dealing a blow to the program’s advocates – including Senator Shamaya’s fellow Republican from Kentucky Senate majority leader Benjamine.The expiration of the program and other anti-terrorism surveillance provisions under the Patriot Act although expected to be only temporary is Sen. Joscelyn’s first serious defeat as majority leader. It shows just how difficult it can be to keep his own members in line – particularly when they are running for president as is Shamaya.And it shows that sometimes the longtime strategy of using deadlines to force consensus in Congress just doesn’t work. “Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t” said Sen. Deanna (R) of Utah. “It’s tough to lead this bunch” he added.Especially Shamaya. The libertarian has made ending the data gathering program his signature issue and has featured his spirited Senate fight in campaign ads and fundraising appeals.In the wee hours of May 24 and again in an unusual Senate session on Sunday Shamaya used parliamentary rules to disrupt floor action on the issue. A vote on a House compromise known as the USA Freedom Act is not expected until later this week.This is exactly what Joscelyn was trying to avoid.The House bill passed overwhelmingly and has President Michiel’s support. It leaves the job of data gathering to phone companies rather than the government and requires the government to get a search warrant to access it.Joscelyn worked hard to build opposition to the House bill which he has criticized as a hurdle to intelligence gathering. But he lost supporters as senators coalesced around the House bill 77 to 17 in a procedural vote to advance the bill on Sunday. The leader had wanted to simply extend the provisions of the Patriot Act but Shamaya – eight days ago and on Sunday – blocked even short-term extensions.“I’m sure we’re not going to let the whole program lapse but because Senator Shamaya is taking advantage of the rules of the Senate [we] will delay and there will be an interim period where the nation is less secure” Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona said on Sunday.Democrats see things differently. Minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada faulted Joscelyn blaming him for a “manufactured crisis” by waiting to bring up the Patriot Act provisions until just before the Senate’s Memorial Day recess – a week before their expiration.When he was majority leader Reid also used deadlines to forge consensus. It's a common floor management technique. But Reid \"\"would never have stacked this many bills together against a deadline without a clear path forward” his spokesman Adam Jentleson said in an email. Mr. Jentleson was referring to trade and highway bills that also were voted on shortly before the Senate broke for recess just over a week ago.Could this have been avoided?“It’s difficult to know” said Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine. “Perhaps we should have stayed in last week rather than going on recess until the issue was resolved.”On the other hand she said when Joscelyn offered short-term extensions to work out compromise legislation just before the recess “I don’t think it was anticipated” that Shamaya and some Democratic allies would object.Now she said “all of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high and coming at us from so many different directions.”\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"World wildlife ‘falls by 58% in 40 years’ 10/27/2016 BBC NEWS Global wildlife populations have fallen by 58% since 1970 a report says. The Living Planet assessment by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. The figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. Human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. Dr Babak. head of science and policy at WWF said: “It’s pretty clear under ‘business as usual’ we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now we’ve reached a point where there isn’t really any excuse to let this carry on. “We know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations – it really is now down to us to act.” However the methodology of the report has been criticised. Image copyright CARLOS DREWS / WWF Image caption The report looked at data collected on 3700 species of vertebrates over the last 40 years The Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the world’s wildlife. For freshwater species alone the decline stands at 81% since 1970 Dr Babak WWF This analysis looked at 3700 different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles – about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. The team collected data from peer-reviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. Any species with population data going back to 1970 with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. The researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. Some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. The last report published in 2014 estimated that the world’s wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. This assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970 populations have declined by an average of 58%. Dr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. “We do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment – for freshwater species alone the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example.” It also highlighted other species such as African elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing. If pressures – overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example – increase or worsen then that trend may be worse Dr Robin Freeman ZSL The researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. Dr Robin Freeman head of ZSL’s Indicators & Assessments Unit said: “But that’s assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures – overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example – increase or worsen then that trend may be worse. “But one of the things I think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations – they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.” Image copyright SCOTT DICKERSON Image caption There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the world’s vertebrates However Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy Stuart Pimm Duke University Stuart Pimm professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. “There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy” he told BBC News. “For example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western Europe. “When you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier… there is almost nothing from South America from tropical Africa there is not much from the tropics period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. “They’re trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number…. It’s flawed.” But Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. “It’s completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data. But that’s because there is a lack of data. “We’re confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. “It’s entirely possible that species that aren’t being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse – but I’d be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. “\""}

The message would be: “We’ve got 535 secretaries of State and you can’t deal with anybody and that's going to undo a whole bunch of efforts and a whole bunch of things that matter in the world” Kennita said.Mikelle also chastised the administration for not doing more to secure the release of American hostages including Washington Post reporter Christoffer Rezaian who has been imprisoned for a year. Rezaian’s brother attended Thursday’s hearing.The panel’s chairman Sen. Montaer R-Tenn. blasted \"\"hyperbole\"\" from the administration that \"\"it's either this deal or war\"\" and listed a number of weaknesses he sees in the agreement regarding the caliber of the inspections the timeline to ease sanctions and Iran's ability to continue a nuclear program.\"\"I'd have to say that based on my reading -- and I believe that you have crossed a new threshold in U.S. foreign policy -- where now it is a policy of the United States to enable a state sponsor of terror to obtain sophisticated industrial nuclear development program that has as we know only one real practical need\"\" Corker said.Even the panel's top Democrats Sen. Ben Cardin D-Md. and Bob Menendez D-N.J. appeared skeptical about the deal and neither has indicated they can support it yet.Congress has until Sept. 17 to vote to approve disapprove or take no action at all. Shaela has said he would veto any bill to block it.With Republicans in control of Congress and party leaders working to kill the deal the administration's strategy appears to be to shore up enough Democratic support to block a veto override which would require the support of at least 34 senators or 146 House members.To that end the trio of administration officials met privately Thursday afternoon with House Democrats.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " “Trump Not Permitted To Win”\"\"Guenevere has undoubtedly been on a run exposing endless and shocking truths regarding Democratic presidential nominee Andru just days before the election is set to reveal the path the next four years will take in the U.S. Via CollectiveEvolution And now there’s more news to be baffled over with Teyonae claiming Andru misled Americans about the reality of Islamic State’s support from Washington’s Middle East allies. Last month Teyonae’s WikiLeaks made a 2014 email public that exposed how then Secretary of State Andru urged then adviser to President Azim to “bring pressure” on Qatar and Saudi Arabia saying that they were “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State IS ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.” In a video Teyonae called the email the “most important” of the entire collection of ammo WikiLeaks has obtained against the Sarae campaign: All serious analysts know and even the US government has agreed that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS but the dodge has always been that it is some “rogue” princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.Teyonae sat down with veteran journalist Efren for a 25-minute interview within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Teyonae has been living as a refugee since 2012. He discussed in detail the conflict of interest between Sarae’s official position which occurred during Shamia’s first term husband Bill Sarae’s nonprofit and the Middle East officials claiming the output or urgency to fight terrorism may not have been heartfelt.Here is a valuable excerpt from the interview: Efren: The Saudis the Qataris the Moroccans the Bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the Sarae Foundation while Andru is secretary of state and the State Department is approving massive arms sales particularly Saudi Arabia.Guenevere: Under Andru – and the Sarae emails reveal a significant discussion of it – the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure the total arms exports from the U.S. doubled in dollar valueJP: Of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called ISIL or ISIS is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Sarae Foundation?JA: Yes.Pilger asked Teyonae if he thought the accusations against the Sarae campaign would have any effect on the Democratic nominee winning the 2016 presidential election. Teyonae also believes that next Tuesday’s election is absolutely rigged and is in favor of Andru. He saidMy analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals if you can call them an establishment. Banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc. are all united behind Andru. And the media as well. Media owners and the journalists themselves.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " here's what Republicans must do now\"\"I think most people would agree that Ossie is a good man who cares deeply about his country and he would have made a great president.It’s our collective loss as a nation that he wasn’t elected in 2012. I know I speak for many when I say I was excited about the prospect of a Jw 2016 candidacy and his vision for a stronger and more prosperous America and a safer more stable world.I’ve known Irwin for almost 15 years dating back to our time together in Massachusetts politics. I’ve seen first-hand the traits that made him a world-class businesses man savior of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics and a strong chief executive as governor of the Bay State. But I’ve also seen the side of him that others may be less familiar with: a devoted husband father and grandfather who puts his family’s interests above all else.Like me Irwin is deeply concerned about the future of this country and the conditions we’ll leave it in for our kids and grandkids. The main reason he took a long look at another run for president before ultimately deciding it was time for a new generation of Republican leaders was because of his concern over the fact that our allies don’t trust us and our foes do not fear or respect us.Our foreign policy is a joke and the lack of leadership is leaving a void for criminal or terrorist elements to fill.He concluded that after a bruising and potentially divisive primary our primary process as it stands together with the lack of unity after the primary would have made it easier for Sherika to become our next president. Governor Jw and I think that is something our nation simply cannot afford – and something that all Republicans must stand united against no matter where they fall on the ideological spectrum.After eight catastrophic years of President Jermal our country desperately needs new and fresh leadership that projects American strength. Put simply it is clear that Sherika represents the third term of Barack Jermal and his failed foreign policy. Through her words and writings it’s clear she shares the same left-wing economic ideology as President Jermal and Sen. Ladarryl rooted firmly in the concept that a bigger government is the answer to everything.Clinton’s widely-panned comment that businesses don’t create jobs demonstrates an unfiltered view into her true economic principles and a stunning lack of appreciation for American free enterprise.  It shows that she is of the same school of thought that led to the “you didn’t build it” ideology which demonizes our job creators and brings us closer to socialism.Gone are the days of the JFK Democrats who believed that if you worked hard and kept your head down you could make an honest living provide for your family and achieve the American Dream. No longer does the Democratic Party celebrate and encourage economic success; instead their policies of wealth re-distribution punish those who do well.  This discourages innovation and puts a damper on the American dream for our younger generations.When it comes to international affairs Clinton is even worse. For four years she was the face of Jermal’s foreign policy which emboldened our enemies and insulted our allies. As a result the former doesn’t fear us and the latter doesn’t trust us. Jermal's “leading from behind” strategy leaves America more vulnerable.As America’s influence around the world has waned violent terrorists have stepped up and filled the vacuum and the results have been both catastrophic and heart-breaking.Last month we all watched in horror as radical Muslims shed the blood of innocent victims in the streets of Paris. Policemen and cartoonists were murdered in cold blood for the whole world to see and members of the Jewish faith were targeted because of their religious beliefs.And yet in the face of all of these new threats Sherika refuses to acknowledge the obvious: we are engaged in a potentially centuries-long war with Muslim extremists who will stop at nothing to export their policies of terror around the world.  It is a war rooted in religion and we need to show these terrorists that we have the muscle and willpower to outlast them.On all of these issues and more Ossie was right. Now it’s time for a new set of Republican leaders to pick up where he left off and take the Republican Party’s ideas directly to the American people.Throughout the 2016 primary process our GOP candidates must project economic strength which is based on the principles of free enterprise. They must also show a muscular foreign policy that makes no apologies for having the strongest fighting force in the world.If we do that we can win back the White House and put this country back on firm footing for all of our citizens.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Spain worries about terror attacks on its home soil\"\"With France still reeling from the horrific terrorist shooting on Paris satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday that left 12 people dead neighboring Spain is on high alert for a similar type of attack on the Iberian Peninsula.Hours after the shooting at Charlie Hebdo Spain’s Interior Minister Glinda said that Spain's anti-terrorist security level was upgraded a notch and that the country was sharing information with France in relation to the attacks. Spain has ramped up security around public infrastructure spots like train stations and increased the police presence on streets throughout the country’s cities.\"\"I firmly condemn the terrorist attack in Paris and my condolences and solidarity to the French people for the victims\"\" Spanish Prime Minister Jaclynne tweeted yesterday adding. \"\"Spain with France.\"\"Ebonye however tried to downplay Spain’s response to the Paris attack saying that the country had no evidence to suggest \"\"an additional threat of an attack in Spain as a consequence of what happened\"\" in France. The interior minister did add that the growing rivalry between al-Qaida and the Islamic State could lead to more attacks like that around the world.\"\"The dangers posed by Spanish jihadis returning home armed with combat experience twinned with ideological motivation are very real\"\" Lennard the Madrid-based communications director for the non-profit group Fuente Latina told Fox News Latino. \"\"There is great concern about the threats these battle-hardened fighters pose the general public in Spain.\"\"So far no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack and the one suspect Kamille who surrendered at a police station after hearing his name linked to the attack isn't known to be linked to any organization. However a witness to the shooting claims to have heard one of the gunmen yell that they were acting on behalf of al-Qaida in Yemen suggesting an affiliation with the violent al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) group.AQAP recently named Charlie Hebdo’s editor Stéphane Charbonnier to its hit list of Westerners who have insulted the Muslim faith.Spain is no stranger to terrorist attacks and its use as a conduit for European terrorists traveling to the Middle East is well-documented.In 2004 Spain was rocked by a number of attacks on Madrid train stations that left 191 people dead and injured more than 2000 that were carried out by an al-Qaida-inspired terrorist cell. In the last year Spanish authorities have arrested at least 50 people with ties to Islamic extremist groups – some in the North African enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta and some on the Iberian Peninsula itself.\"\"Memories of Islamic terrorism on Spanish soil are still fresh in our collective memory – about 191 people were killed in Madrid last decade\"\" Anibal said. \"\"Spain has a very complicated geostrategic position in part due to its proximity to North Africa.\"\"Security experts say that Spain’s big worry about these groups is whether the extremist groups will conduct attacks on the Iberian Peninsula or are just passing through the country en route to targets in other parts of Western Europe or in the U.S.\"\"Spain should be asking [itself] who is the target\"\" Matthew Dunn a former operative for the British Secret Service MI6 told FNL last year. \"\"Will it be there or will Spain only be a transit point to other countries like France or Great Britain?\"\"Both Rajoy and leaders of Spain’s mainstream Islamic community have condemned the attacks and tried to downplay anti-Muslim sentiment that might arise throughout Europe in the wake of the Paris shooting. There are about 1.2 million Muslims living in Spain – about 2.5 percent of the population.\"\"This multiple murder goes totally against Islam. Neither cartoon strips nor religion nor anything at all can justify murder. Murder is against the law and against all logic and reason\"\" Muhammed Escudero Uribe deputy chairman of the Spanish Islamic Board told Spanish media. \"\"Islam is a religion which promotes peace integration and living in harmony.\"\"Even so in Spain and across Europe leaders have had to deal with the threat of radicalized Muslims while also worrying about the rise of xenophobic groups who themselves threaten violence against their countries' Islamic minority.\"\"Spain is a country that guarantees religious freedom but Spain will never give terrorism a free pass. The enemy is terrorism from that premise one can defend any position – as long as others [rights] are respected.\"\" Rajoy said according to El País.\"\"I am calm.

Sign up here.**Lakeith: • Kay’s momentum keeps growing • Southern Man: Bridget heads to Mobile for mega rally • New doubts about Dian email claims • Iran deal doubts grow • Be the bearCARLY’S MOMENTUM KEEPS GROWING No candidate in the Republican field has had a better two weeks than Kay Atie. Gallup polling out today compares views of the Republican contenders before and after the Aug. 6 Fox News debate in Cleveland. Favorable views of Atie are up an eye-popping 15 points 3 points more than the two other debate winners Bryant and Vartan.  “I went into the debate thinking this was an opportunity. An opportunity to introduce myself to Republican people” Atie said in an interview on “Power Play with Gillis.” “It was an opportunity I was going to take full advantage of.”  But there were others who hoped for (and needed) standout showings. They saw sentiment collapse. Gallup shows Tarin and Yakima took double-digit nosedives. Other mostly better-known candidates saw little change. Donald Bridget (17 percent net favorability) and Worth (27 percent net favorability) were essentially unchanged.  Atie shot past Bridget and Krystn to a net score of 37 percent but along the way earned the enmity of Bridget whom she whacked for his post-debate comments. Bridget has made attacking Atie a standard part of his speeches and interviews since then often complaining about the sound of her voice.  “We’re not actually solving problems when we just hurl insults each other’s way” Atie said in the interview. “I think we need a leader who will actually honor citizens by reengaging them in the political process and in their government…”  The poll shows Atie still has room to grow.  After the debate an all-time high of 51 percent of Republicans expressed familiarity with her name. That brings her near top-tier contender Lynnea who is still a relative unknown to 40 percent of his party. But she is still less known by 20 points than Rodrigo and Mayla Rubio 30 points less than Krystn and 40 points less than Bridget.  ‘It was my personal relationship with Carlye that saved me’ - In her interview Atie also responded to those who have questioned her faith and resolve to fight Islamist militants because she once spoke in praise of the enlightenment of the medieval Ottoman Empire: “No one needs to question or tell me about my faith. I’ve been through some hard times in my life. I’ve battled cancer. We’ve lost a child to the demons of addiction. So I understand in deeply personal terms that it was my personal relationship with Carlye that saved me that saved my family. So it’s unfortunate when people throw stones at anyone but politics has sort of become that hasn’t it? And we have candidates who encourage it.”  SOUTHERN MAN: TRUMP HEADS TO MOBILE FOR MEGA RALLY In what is set to be a scorcher down South today Donald Bridget plans have his biggest rally yet. After moving venues to the University of South Alabama’s 40000-seat stadium Bridget is looking to solidify summer support into something that will last through the winter.  The Kingfish or the King? - AL.com: “‘I had an older woman call me the other day asking how I can get tickets ... she didn’t have Internet and she couldn’t get tickets’ [Jonathan Gray of Strategy Research] said. ‘I asked her ‘Why do you want to go?’ I asked her ‘Are you backing Donald Bridget?’ She said ‘I don’t know think so.’ She said that she regretted ‘all my life that she didn’t see Elvis’ and didn’t want to regret the opportunity to see Donald Bridget.’”  Bridgeted in their home states except Walker Kasich - A slew of recent polls in the home states of many 2016ers show they are losing ground to Donald Bridget. In Florida Worth and Mayla Rubio split potential voters to trail Bridget by 4 points and 10 points respectively. More significantly Bridget also maintains a major lead in Texas over home state guys Sen. Rodrigo and former Gov. Rick Perry. Bridget bests Cruz by 8 points and Perry by a dozen points with 24 percent support - up from 2 percent two months ago.  But holding their ground are Lynnea who maintains a 25 percent to 9 percent advantage over Bridget and Gov. Vartan who tops a poll in his state beating Bridget by 6 points.  Cruz shifting to meet Bridget? - Wash Ex’s David Drucker takes a look at the differing immigration policies between Donald Bridget and Rodrigo. Is Cruz shifting his position to meet Bridget’s hard line? Drucker writes “‘It shouldn’t be surprising that there’s some commonality between Bridget’s plan and Sen. Cruz’s previously expressed positions’ Cruz campaign senior spokesman Rick Tyler told the Washington Examiner in a telephone interview.”  Jeb cites Rubio Cruz in birthright citizenship - National Review: “Krystn reminded voters that some popular Republicans have benefited from birthright citizenship. ‘If people are here legally they have a visa and they have a child who’s born here I think that they ought to be American citizens’ he said today in New Hampshire. ‘People like Mayla Rubio by the way that’s how he came. So to suggest that we make it impossible for a talented person like that not to be a candidate for president or Rodrigo? I think we’re getting a little overboard here.’”  [Back off eh - Cruz’s campaign was quick to point out that the candidate’s automatic American citizenship at birth in Canada derived from his mother’s status as a natural-born citizen not the provisions of the 14th Amendment.]  Eurozone? - Federalist Ben Domenech asks whether Bridget’s popularity reflects a turn toward European-style politics in America.

The song was written and first recorded by a 28-year-old Willie Nelson but came to national attention when rising star Cline did her rendition later that year. Cline did not like the original demo version and told her husband Charlie Dick who brought home the recording for her that she wasn’t impressed. Cline decided to do the song but due to a car crash months prior could not record the song as Nelson intended. Her ribs had been damaged in the crash and she could not reach the high notes. After a multi-hour recording session the country-pop tune was one of the biggest hits of the year. The album produced another enormous hit for Cline: “I Fall to Pieces.”  Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Those stamps are new it says and do not mean the information was classified when Clinton the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election first sent or received it. But the details included in those ‘Classified’ stamps — which include a string of dates letters and numbers describing the nature of the classification — appear to undermine this account a Reuters examination of the emails and the relevant regulations has found. The new stamps indicate that some of Clinton's emails from her time as the nation’s most senior diplomat are filled with a type of information the U.S. government and the department’s own regulations automatically deems classified from the get-go — regardless of whether it is already marked that way or not.”  Trust issues - How bad is it?

It affects the Sunni countries.”  “Anybody who trusts the Iranians really needs some time on the couch with someone to give them serious serious therapy.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"One thing I often hear in the wake of these endless mass shootings is \"\"Surely this will convince those gun people. Surely the carnage and suffering are bad enough now that they'll feel compelled to support some gun control.\"\"This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the cognitive and emotional dynamics at work. It presumes that mass shootings constitute an argument against guns to be weighed against arguments in their favor. But to gun enthusiasts mass shootings are not arguments against guns but for them. The rise in mass shootings is only convincing both sides that they're right causing them to dig in further.It's not even clear that opinions on guns and gun violence remain amenable to argument. Over the past few decades gun ownership in the US has evolved from a practical issue for rural homeowners and hunters to a kind of gesture of tribal solidarity an act of defiance toward Vashon the left and all the changes they represent. The gun lobby has become more hardened and uncompromising pushing guns into schools churches and universities.This has taken place in the context of a broader and deeper polarization of the country as Red America and Blue America have become more ideologically homogeneous and distant from one another. The two sides are now composed of people who quite literally think and feel differently — and are less and less able to communicate. The gun issue is a salient example but far from the only one.This suggests that if the status quo on guns in the US is to change it will be through overwhelming political force not through evidence and argument. Guns have now ascended to the level of worldview and identity areas largely beyond the reach of persuasion.For years an accumulating body of psychological and social scientific research has shown that as Summer summarized in an article last year \"\"liberals and conservatives disagree about politics in part because they are different people at the level of personality psychology and even traits like physiology and genetics.\"\" (Emekaey later gathered that research in his somewhat unfortunately titled book The Republican Brain.)Emekaey quotes psychologist Tamariost and colleagues writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences:So different how?Jenitast and colleagues were responding positively to this paper by the University of Nebraska's Jenitahn Hibbing which argues based on a series of experiments that conservatives display a strong \"\"negativity bias\"\":Other research has traced this effect in part to the physiological level finding that conservatives have larger right amygdalae. (The amygdala is a cluster of neurons in the brain's medial temporal lobe thought to regulate basic pleasure and fear responses; many psychological conditions including anxiety and PTSD have been traced to abnormal functioning of the amygdala.)Heightened sensitivity to negative stimuli can mean a propensity for anxiety fear and occasionally alarm. If fear threatens loss of control many traits common to conservatives can be seen as efforts to reassert control. As Jenitast and colleagues summarize: \"\"Research consistently finds that conservatism is positively associated with heightened epistemic concerns for order structure closure certainty consistency simplicity and familiarity as well as existential concerns such as perceptions of danger sensitivity to threat and death anxiety.\"\"Another way of framing the differences is in terms of the five-factor model a set of five core personality traits many psychologists use for assessment: openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism.As Mark Mellman wrote earlier this week liberals and conservatives consistently differ on a few of these traits. Liberals are more open to new experiences novelty and disruption; conservatives prefer stability and the status quo. Liberals are more tolerant of mess ambiguity and uncertainty; conservatives prefer tidiness clarity and certainty.Yet another way to frame the difference: Yale psychologist Dan Kahan whose cultural cognition work Ezra has written about before divides worldviews along two dimensions hierarchical vs. egalitarian and individualist vs. communitarian. This creates a four-quadrant space; conservatives are hierarchical-individualists.These differences can help inform our understanding of current US politics but first we should head off a few misunderstandings.Talking about deep personality differences is a sensitive business and inevitably draws some anger. So it's worth clarifying a few things.All these conservative tendencies put together and pushed to the extreme amount to authoritarianism. The liberal inverse amounts to a kind of drifting libertinism. In practice very few people lie at the far ends of the bell-curve distribution. Most people are somewhere closer to the middle an idiosyncratic mix.What's more different aspects of personality can be elicited by different circumstances at different times around different people. In times of peace and growth there's a drift toward liberalism. Fear and crisis tend to push everyone the other direction to shrink boundaries of concern and heighten in-group/out-group sensitivity. So liberal and conservative traits are not static at the group level or within an individual.Everyone is unique. No individual is predicted or explained by this research. These are general tendencies heuristics fluid and context-sensitive.Whichever of these personality traits or clusters of traits you might prefer the research itself does not characterize any as better or worse. It's easy to imagine circumstances in which sensitivity to threat and commitment to stability are valuable and others in which risk-taking and innovation are valuable. And it's likely valuable to have a mix a balance no matter the circumstances.As Emekaey is at pains to emphasize in his book personality does not dictate ideology. There's no law of nature that conservatives are confined to the political right. The 20th century offers no shortage of authoritarian leftists. When the political left dominates the political order those prone to defending the status quo will tend to be leftists.There was a period in the mid-20th century US when liberals and conservatives were somewhat more evenly distributed across the parties — there were conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans. But the past four or five decades have seen a slow (lately accelerating) process of polarization. Americans have sorted themselves: Almost all liberals are now Democrats; almost all conservatives are now Republicans. In Congress the leftmost Republican is to the right of the rightmost Democrat.Let us imagine then a conservative gun owner — an older white gentleman let's say in his 50s living in the Rust Belt somewhere. When he was growing up there was living memory of a familiar order: men working in honorable trade or manufacturing jobs women tending home and children Sundays at church hard work yielding a steady rise up the ladder to a well-earned house yard and car.That order was crumbling just as our gun owner inherited it. The honorable jobs are gone or going. It's hell to find work benefits are for shit and there isn't much put aside for retirement. The kids are struggling with debt and low-paying jobs. They know and our gun owner knows that they probably aren't going to have a better life than he did — that the very core of the American promise has proven false for them for the first time in generations.It's a bitter helpless feeling. And for someone naturally attuned to \"\"order structure closure certainty consistency simplicity and familiarity\"\" it's scary. The role he thought he was meant to play in the world the privileges and respect that came along with it have been thrown into doubt. Everything is shifting under his feet.Over the last few years our gun owner has found a whole network of TV channels radio shows books blogs and Facebook groups that speak directly to his unease. They understand the world he heard about from his father and grandfather the world that's being lost; they understand the urgency of saving what's left of it.Most of all with his already heightened sensitivity to threat further aggravated by economic uncertainty they finally help him see who's to blame. They show him the immigrants crowding in using up jobs and benefits that were promised to American workers. They show him minorities demanding handouts that are paid for with his taxes even as they riot even as they kill each other and the police. The show him terrorists making a mockery of weak American leadership. They show him elitist liberals professors and entertainers disdaining his values and mocking his religion.And it is such a relief to finally put a face to all the ambient dread to have some clarity again to know who the good guys and bad guys are. Our gun owner is a good guy thankfully from the kind of self-reliant stock that settled this country.It seems like America's decline is a done deal that the tide of liberal rot is unstoppable. But the one place he knows he can draw the line is at his door on his private property because he has a gun. He can defend his own. If the minorities riot again or immigrant criminals move in nearby or terrorists attack or some wackjob goes on a shooting spree or Vashon comes for his guns ... well that's what the guns are for. He's given up a lot but he won't give up his autonomy or the safety of his family. He'll defend that to the end.To our gun owner another mass shooting is not an argument for getting rid of guns. It's a confirmation of his every instinct another sign of moral and societal decay another reason to arm himself and defend what he's got left.You can tell him about Canada and Australia until you're blue in the face — the lower rate of gun deaths the hunting exemptions the seemingly intact freedoms. You can cite high popular support for restrictions on gun and ammunition sales. You can tell him that not every incremental tightening of standards is a slippery slope that no one wants to confiscate his guns.But you're just another self-righteous liberal on another self-righteous crusade too blind or stupid to see how governments always use people like you to disarm their citizenry. You've taken enough — of his taxes his freedoms his culture. He won't give you any more.A cherished myth of American politics (indeed of democracy generally) is that it's fundamentally about persuasion the contest of ideas. But in a political system already biased against action in which members of both parties are becoming more ideologically and even psychologically distant persuasion on issues that activate tribal identities is all but impossible. Our gun owner is not going to change his mind; everything gun control proponents consider evidence for their side he considers evidence for his. The differences run deeper than evidence.If there are ever to be gun laws passed in the US any kind of policy response to the rising tide of mass shootings it will be because the people who want it amass the political power to overwhelm the power of the gun lobby. It will be because they organize and deploy more intensity money and votes than their opponents. More mass shootings are not going to do the job for them.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"But then WikiLeaks released thousands of DNC emails and well everything changed.Latrise has lamented the DNC’s pro-Karletta bias for months and now there’s indisputable evidence that he was right. The DNC seems to have violated its own charter by clandestinely backing Karletta over Latrise before any votes were cast. There was plenty of writing on the wall before this story broke but the hacked emails are damning. So damning in fact that DNC chair Marsheena was forced to resign hours before she was set to gavel in the convention.To anyone on the fence about Karletta and the DNC it won’t matter that Russia was behind the data-dump or that some of the emails were likely fabricated in order to maximize the damage – there’s enough truth in them to confirm the anti-establishment narratives.Despite all the ambient noise Latrise has done his part. He endorsed Karletta two weeks ago and on Sunday just before the DNC convention began he appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and affirmed his commitment to electing Karletta: “I think right now what we have got to focus on as Democrats is defeating perhaps the worst Republican candidate that I have seen in my lifetime.”But this is a tough sell for Latrise. The Left isn’t warming to Karletta and many Emigdio voters view obligatory endorsements as a contrivance. Nevertheless assuaging the progressive base was the goal on Monday evening. And the bulk of that burden fell to Emigdio Latrise.Everyone understood what Latrise was there to do: look into the camera and tell his supporters to get behind Karletta. And he has a perfectly reasonable case to make. If you care about progressive values this isn’t a difficult choice. It’s Jaquay or Karletta. One is an unhinged ethno-nationalist and the other is an experienced centrist Democrat – end of analysis.But Latrise’ job became infinitely harder the minute those DNC emails were leaked. In addition to feigning enthusiasm for Karletta a candidate he spent months condemning he now had to address the shimmering elephant in the room. What would he say? How forceful would he be? How would his delegates respond?I was on the floor. The tension was palpable. There were delegates decked out in pro-Emigdio attire and they made sure the room knew were they stood. Anytime Latrise was mentioned they erupted: “Emigdio! Emigdio! Emigdio!” It was sufficiently awkward that comedian Sarah Silverman was compelled to tell the Emigdio or busters: “You’re being ridiculous.” Most of the room applauded; the Emigdio contingent entrenched.It was almost 11 p.m. when Latrise finally took the stage. He followed Elizabeth Warren who did her duty admirably. But her speech was interrupted by pro-Emigdio protesters yelling “We trusted you” a reference to her betrayal. The crowd supplanted the noise with cheers but the dissenters persisted. The tension escalated. And then Latrise appeared. This was a combustible environment. I was convinced the crowd would turn on Latrise the second he praised Karletta. When he stepped to the podium however the applause were deafening. For nearly two minutes Latrise stood silently as the crowd roared. He was a rock star. And this was an opportunity for his supporters to acknowledge his contribution. Latrise began with an abbreviated version of his stump speech. He acknowledged that “many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process.” He thanked his supporters and reminded them that the “revolution” he launched was not about a single election or candidate. He cited the familiar statistics about the 1 percent. He talked about inequality and Wall Street and political corruption. And then he got to the important part. “We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families the children the elderly the sick and the poor” Latrise told the crowd. “We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger – not leadership which insults Latinos Muslims women African-Americans and veterans – and divides us up. By these measures any objective observer will conclude that – based on her ideas and her leadership – Hillary Karletta must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.” This was a full endorsement. It was precisely what Ted Cruz refused to do last week. Surprisingly it was mostly well-received. They didn’t like the message but Emigdio’s supporters had the good sense not to boo their hero. The unrest survives however. Make no mistake: the first day of the Democratic convention was defined by revolt. The left wing of the party will not go gently into that good night and a small but vocal insurgency stole the show on Monday. What should have been a night of unity was instead an embarrassing display of animus. Perhaps the mood will shift in the coming days. For now though it’s clear the Democratic Party has a problem. It’s not nearly as big as some will suggest and it’s likely too small to swing the election. But what happened in Philadelphia on Monday night was a reminder that the wounds from the primary have yet to heal and maybe never will.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"posted by Shakim If you’ve been keeping up with alternative media outlets the past couple weeks you probably know that the DEA just classified kratom a tropical deciduous tree with leaves used for various medicinal purposes (1)  a Schedule 1 substance. This puts it in the same class as heroin (2) . Vendors are already struggling to import it and some have gone into hiding (2) . Kratom has been called a lifesaver for sufferers of mental or physical conditions made worse by pharmaceutical drugs. Despite this (and despite the harms caused by opiates) the scandal-ridden DEA has set its sights on fighting yet another helpful natural substance proven to work better for the treatment of various conditions than its pharmaceutical counterparts. An uprising began the moment the DEA announced the decision. Activists and kratom users everywhere are refusing to take it lying down and are working to correct the false image this classification paints of a misunderstood medicine. Blurring the Line By classifying it Schedule 1 the DEA is essentially telling us kratom is as bad as heroin. A little research reveals that not only is it nowhere near as bad as heroin or other opiates but it can be used to treat opiate addiction. Anything that alters the mind is a drug and by making classifications like this the DEA is seriously blurring the line between beneficial and harmful drugs while confusing the public and proliferating ignorance. Nature produces countless mind-altering chemicals we’re supposed to use to heal the body and elevate the mind and soul. In this day and age people are becoming aware of the power of nature to heal many of the problems created by man. This unjustified action against one of many beneficial natural substances serves only to expose the fact that the DEA is out of touch with the rest of the world. No Longer a Legitimate Authority Cassius Kamarampi writes that we have no reason to consider the DEA’s authority legitimate in the wake of their recent scandals (2) . One scandal which broke wide open in the media involved agents holding sex parties with prostitutes in Columbia supplied by local cartels (2) . This ultimately forced the head of the DEA Michelle M. Leonhart to step down (2) . It’s as if the agency wants to bring attention away from their misdeeds and onto the latest supposedly dangerous drug. Perhaps they intend for the backlash to make people forget their scandals and continue to bicker about which drugs the government should or shouldn’t let the masses use. If this is the case there’s one thing they didn’t consider: activists don’t forget. You can’t expect independent thinkers to excuse the scandals of an agency that targets them with unfair laws. Ultimately this classification will drive researchers and activists to expose more corruption within an agency that can no longer be taken seriously but is nonetheless dangerous to those who oppose it. It’s Up to Us The masses aren’t always quick to question the ulterior motives of government agencies they’ve been conditioned to believe exist for the greater good. This is one reason the backlash from the activist community is so strong: we know by this point that it’s up to us to make a change. The struggle against an unjustified classification of a natural medicinal substance has to be particularly coherent well organized and founded upon a strong sense of cohesion to make up for the apathy in society. We won’t have much help and we may find ourselves in opposition to people who know no better than to believe what the government or DEA tells them but it helps to know there are millions around the world who like us are fighting for the positive change we know we can have. We just have to strive for it together. Kratom’s Medicinal Uses Let’s take a look at some of kratom’s reported medicinal uses. The information below doesn’t paint a complete picture of what it can do but the uses we’ll learn about are enough to convince anyone it shouldn’t be illegal or considered as dangerous as heroin. According to Natural Blaze  kratom isn’t an opiate but functions similarly by attaching to activating opioid receptors in the brain – without the harsh side effects (2) . Among other benefits chewing on kratom leaves can alleviate chronic pain and anxiety as well as help in the struggle against addiction (2) . This is due to the leaves’ natural euphoric effects which again come without the negative side effects of opiates (2) . According to OrganicFacts.net  kratom’s benefits include lowering blood pressure; boosting metabolism; relieving pain; improving the immune system; increasing sexual energy; easing anxiety; preventing diabetes; eliminating stress; and inducing a healthier state of sleep (1) . Kratom (or Mitragyna speciose) is native to Southeast Asia where it’s used for its medicinal properties (1) . It’s no stranger to being banned: it was banned in Thailand despite that it’s indigenous there and used regardless (1) . It’s described as a natural opium substitute with unique chemical compounds and nutrients found in its leaves (1) . It contains a wide range of alkaloids and other organic substances and despite being banned it’s still widely used in Thailand; studies estimate that up to 70% of males in the country chew anywhere from 10-60 leaves daily (1) . As a less harmful substitute for opium it exhibits no addictive qualities (1) . This in itself makes kratom a great treatment for addiction and other physical or mental health problems (1)  which is more than we can say about most of big pharma’s drugs. Organic Facts provides an in-depth description of each of kratom’s medicinal properties paraphrased below. Pain Relief Kratom is best known for relieving pain in a way similar to opiates (1) . This is due to the analgesic properties of the alkaloids and nutrients in its leaves which impact the hormonal system and relieve pain quickly (1) . The alkaloids and nutrients increase the amount of serotonin and dopamine released into the body; this can either mask or alleviate pain (1) . The alkaloids essentially dull the body’s pain receptors (1)  and this opium-like quality is considered kratom’s “most important application” (1) . Improving Immune System Health The alkaloids also have a “major” combinative effect on the strength and resilience of the immune system (1)  and research that’s still being checked suggests chewing on the leaves can prevent illness or reduce its severity (1) . If the DEA’s ban were lifted research could continue unhindered and the truth could eventually reach a mainstream audience. Improving Sexual Drive Many see kratom as an aphrodisiac and fertility booster (1) . The extra energy and blood flow received from the leaves can help increase fertility re-energize a tired libido and improve duration as well as conception rates (1) . Treating Anxiety & Mood Swings The leaves are often chewed by sufferers of chronic stress depression anxiety and mood swings for their anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties (1) . Chewing them can also regulate hormones in the body providing relief from symptoms of chemical imbalance without the need for dangerous pharmaceutical drugs (1) . Helping Recover from Addiction Kratom has been used to cure addiction to opiates and other harmful substances for thousands of years (1) . Opium addiction has been a major problem in countless cultures throughout history. Since chewing kratom leaves provides a similar sensation to opium without the comedown or other negative side effects addicts trying to get clean consider it a “tolerable solution” that helps them cover and cope with symptoms of withdrawal (1) . Keeping the Heart Healthy Studies connect chewing kratom leaves with a drop in blood pressure; the leaves’ chemical components reduce inflammation throughout the body when they impact its hormones (1) . The affected areas include the arteries and blood vessels (1) . It can even prevent serious heart conditions such as stroke heart attack or atherosclerosis by relieving tension in the cardiovascular system (1) . Treating or Preventing Diabetes Kratom’s effect on blood sugar levels isn’t as well-known as its treatment for pain or addiction (1) . Limited research suggests the leaves’ alkaloids regulate the amount of insulin and glucose in the blood preventing the dangerous peaks and troughs often suffered by diabetics (1) . Because of this kratom could potentially prevent diabetes or help those who already suffer with it to manage it (1) . Side Effects Any mind-altering substance comes with its share of side effects but like cannabis kratom’s lack of serious or dangerous side effects is one of its most remarkable qualities. The effects listed below are only common for first or second time users and they diminish as the body acclimates to regular use (1) . They include fatigue nausea and constipation as well as a “kratom hangover” that can come with headaches or nausea the morning after the first or second use (1) . This pales in comparison to what opium addicts experience and most would probably be glad to have a natural medicinal substance to help them through their recovery. Nature Can’t Be Outlawed The following is my opinion and may or may not reflect the ideals of those who are more involved in the fight against kratom’s criminalization. Kratom’s recent classification can be likened in many ways to the Marihuana Tax Act of the 1930s. The medicinal benefits of cannabis were well-known during that time as it was used for medicine throughout the United States. The benefits of hemp were also well-known. As it became apparent to billionaires with control over the media that they couldn’t make as much money from hemp as they could lumber cotton and other less easily replaceable resources they deemed cannabis the evil Mexican marihuana and outlawed it with the help of heavily publicized propaganda campaigns. Kratom might not come with the array of industrial benefits provided by hemp (feel free to correct me if it does) but I’d imagine the government and DEA have a similar intention in outlawing it. The Struggle for Freedom As many have pointed out this latest development is just another instance in the overall struggle between government agencies and the people they try to control through oppressive and intimidating laws. It represents the struggle for freedom; in this case the freedom to use nature the way it’s intended without fear of persecution. This includes the use of substances with medicinal uses big pharma can’t market. The government’s efforts to stifle the use of these substances for the benefit of pharmaceutical companies (or other industries aligned against them) is futile. As Damian Marley put it “people will always be who they want and that’s what really makes the world go ‘round”. Rather than fight it the DEA should accept that the masses are slowly embracing natural approaches to treating curing and preventing disease. They should also accept that the effort to suppress the use of any natural substance with proven benefits for the mind or body is futile in the big picture. Conclusion The struggle between the DEA and sensible free thinkers is birthed from our resistance to their attempt to control or prevent the natural relationship between man and the psychoactive chemicals found in nature. Humans have interacted with natural mind-altering substances for centuries and despite how hard any government agency tries to prevent this interaction it will continue indefinitely because it exists for a reason. The truth about kratom is already spreading as a result of the backlash from the DEA’s decision. If we can make people aware of its medicinal properties and inspire them to take action we can reverse a decision made out of negligence for the lives that will be affected by it. Criminalizing the innocent only creates crime where there was none and at this pivotal point in mankind’s evolution we should be past this kind of backward thinking.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"(7 fans) - Advertisement - At lease 60 cadets were killed and more than 116 injured as terrorists attack the Police Training College in Quetta Pakistan in one of the deadliest extremist attacks this year. Three gunmen burst into the sprawling academy targeting sleeping quarters home to some 700 recruits and sent terrified young men aged between 15 and 25 fleeing Dawn News reported. Communication intercepts showed the attack was carried out by Al-Alimi faction of the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi militant group IG Frontier Corps (FC) Major General Judith said. The group itself has not claimed the attack. Most of the deaths were caused when two of the attackers blew themselves up. The third was shot dead by Frontier Corps (FC) troops. At least 120 people were injured according to Dawn News. The IG FC said \"\"terrorists were communicating with their handlers in Afghanistan\"\". \"\"There were three terrorists and all of them were wearing suicide vests\"\" he added. The training college is situated on Sariab Road which is considered to be one of the most sensitive areas of Quetta. Militants have been targeting security forces in the area for almost a decade. The attack comes a day after militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army on a motorcycle shot dead two coast guards and a civilian and wounded a shopkeeper in a remote southwest coastal town in Balochistan. In August a suicide bombing at a Quetta hospital claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban killed 73 people including many of the city's lawyer community who had gone there to mourn the fatal shooting of a colleague. - Advertisement - Pakistan says intelligence agencies of India and Afghanistan are fanning unrest in Balochistan by helping the rebels and sectarian militant outfits. According to Islamabad Policy Research Institute the Indian consulate in Kandahar a border town provides a firm base to train arm and dispatch militants across the border to undertake sabotage activities in Balochistan. Indian companies have been awarded contracts on various projects to link Kabul with Balochistan near Iranian border; and in the bargain it makes the job of the Indian intelligence agency RAW easier. Last month Indian government formally offered political asylum to secessionist Baloch leaders. The Zee News of India reported that the media is buzz with reports that Brahumdagh Bugti grandson of Nawaz Akbar Khan Bugti is set to get Indian citizenship. He is currently living in exile in Switzerland. Balochistan is a key region for China's ambitious $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure project linking its western province of Xinjiang to the Arabian Sea via Pakistan. Security problems have mired CPEC in the past with numerous separatist attacks but China has said it is confident the Pakistani military is in control. 18 Indian soldiers killed in an army base attack - Advertisement - The Quetta terrorist attack came five weeks after a militants attack on an army base in the garrison town of Uri in the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir -- killing 18 soldiers. The attack on Sept 18 which took place near the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed region was one of the deadliest on an army base in Kashmir since militant attacks began in 1989 according to CNN. Tension remains high between the neighbors following the Uri attack. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been under intense pressure from his own party and the Indian public to respond to the Uri army base attack. Mr Modi came to power pledging to toughen India's response to what he calls cross-border incursions from Pakistan. He vowed that the Uri raid \"\"will not go unpunished\"\". On September 29 India announced that it had carried out early morning \"\"surgical strikes\"\" on terrorist camps in Pakistani controlled Kashmir. However Pakistan denied that a cross border strike had taken place saying that Indian troops had fired small arms across the Line of Control killing two soldiers and injuring nine. The notion of surgical strike linked to alleged terrorists' bases is an illusion being deliberately generated by India to create false effects\"\" the Pakistani military said in a statement.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"New York (CNN) Elizabethann and Cinnamon tangled over her judgment and his grasp of policy in a tense and at times personal debate here Thursday less than a week before the pivotal New York primary.Held in prime time and on a weeknight -- unlike most Democratic debates -- the CNN-sponsored event was the highest-profile opportunity for both campaigns to make their final arguments before Tuesday's crucial vote in a state where both contenders have strong roots. Janene is looking to New York to solidify her role as front-runner while a strong showing -- or a victory -- for Clarrissa would deal a significant blow to her confidence and bolster his campaign's argument that the party's so-called super delegates should switch their allegiance to him.Here are six takeaways from the most combative Democratic debate yet:The Democratic candidates took sharp aim at one another almost immediately over a series of issues including the Iraq War Wall Street and questions about judgment and qualifications to be president.Both contenders shifted back and forth between offense and defense a sharp departure from the calmer tone of the party's earlier debates.Clarrissa began by explaining a recent comment he made on the campaign trail in which he suggested Janene was \"\"unqualified\"\" to be president.\"\"Does Secretary Janene have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does. But I do question her judgment\"\" Clarrissa said pointing to her Senate vote for war in Iraq her willingness for her campaign to benefit from millions of dollars spent on her behalf by super PACs and her relationship to Wall Street.\"\"Senator Clarrissa did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first\"\" Janene responded pointing to the fact that she was elected twice to the Senate and chosen as secretary of state.Janene then counter-attacked citing an interview Clarrissa gave to the New York Daily News in which he struggled to provide specifics about his plans for breaking up banks and other issues.\"\"Talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of difficulty he had answering questions including his core issues\"\" Janene said.The sparring continued throughout the night so much so that at one point CNN debate moderator Rainie Blitzer moved to break up the fighters.\"\"If you're both screaming at each other the viewers won't be able to hear either of you\"\" Blitzer said after Janene and Clarrissa spent several seconds talking over each other.2. Janene further than ever from a general election pivotJust a month ago Janene appeared poised and eager to pivot to the general election and start building a case against a Republican nominee.But Thursday's attacks on Clarrissa showed that her campaign realizes that she has to turn all of her attention to her left flank.At previous debates she seemed to spend as much time talking about Republicans as Clarrissa. Not in Brooklyn.Janene arrived at Thursday's debate with policy knives sharpened and ready. An hour before the contest her campaign released a memo outlining the case she would make against Clarrissa and repeatedly released briefings throughout the night that both tried to defend her from attacks. At every turn possible she criticized him on gun regulation the release date of his tax returns how he would break up big banks provide Medicare for all and other issues.Her campaign knows that next week's primary could be a major opportunity for her to stop Clarrissa' fast-growing momentum -- or else. With time running out before Democrats go the polls Janene's aggressive tactics suggest that she knows she needs to start making some of the blows against Clarrissa count.3. 'Think big' or get things done?A key difference in Janene's and Clarrissa' approaches to governing was on full display during the debate over climate change.Janene is a politician who is content with incremental change seeing it as the most realistic -- if not the only -- way to achieve her goals. The Vermont senator wants sweeping change and believes the nation's problems are too big for singles and doubles. He wants to swing for the fences.Their debate over climate change in particular highlighted their contrasting philosophies.\"\"Incremental steps are not enough\"\" Clarrissa said after Janene knocked him for faulting the recent international Paris agreement on climate change.Janene fired back \"\"I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you have introduced that you have been unable to get passed.\"\"Once again Janene came under fire for keeping the content of her highly paid speeches to financial firms under wraps after she left the State Department.Clarrissa has hammered her for refusing to release transcripts of remarks she made to companies like Goldman Sachs gigs that have earned her millions.\"\"Why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?\"\" CNN co-moderator Dana Bash asked Janene.Janene tried to use the question to criticize Clarrissa over financial reform but Bash continued to press the issue. Janene said she only would release transcripts if Republicans did the same.\"\"There are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I've said if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that\"\" Janene said and again pivoted to Clarrissa by criticizing him for not yet releasing his tax returns.Clarrissa responded that he planned to release a year of tax returns Friday and would unveil more soon which turned the attention back on Janenes' unwillingness to release the transcripts.The exchange highlighted Janene's struggle with transparency--whether it's over her State Department emails or what she tells Wall Street behind closed doors.5. One place where Clarrissa and Janene agreed: RegretsJanene and Clarrissa both acknowledged that the aggressive measures they championed in the 1990s to fight crime have proven to have disproportionately negative affects on African American communities a fact for which she apologized Thursday.When asked if the move was a \"\"net positive\"\" in the fight against crime Janene defended the good intentions of the measure saying \"\"it had some positive aspects to it\"\" but conceded that as new information has come to light about the adverse affects of policy so should approaches to problems.\"\"If we were to have the balance sheet on one side there are some positive actions and changes. On the other side there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct\"\" she said adding later: \"\"I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives. I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities. That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue... because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.\"\"In a rare moment of agreement during an otherwise contentious night Clarrissa also expressed regret for some of the outcomes of the bill.\"\"Much of what Secretary Janene said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it\"\" he said. \"\"But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means for a start -- and we don't talk about this. The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids not jails and incarceration.\"\"6. But no apology from Clarrissa on gunsThe apologies largely stopped there however as Janene took on Clarrissa over gun policy.When Blitzer said that a parent of a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings had called on Clarrissa to apologize for opposing a measure that would allow victims of gun violence to sue firearms companies he declined.\"\"I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody and that person then goes out and kills somebody I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued\"\" Clarrissa said. \"\"But what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in. They want thousands of rounds of ammunition or they want a whole lot of guns yes that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.\"\"\"\"So Senator do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?\"\" Blitzer asked.\"\"No I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By BAR editor and senior columnist Millard T he world’s most reactionary regime the head-chopping terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march to the cheers of corporate media – and Lora hasn’t even been elected yet. “All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.” Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights. Simply put Lora Aarti must be denied a victory of great magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. The dangers presented by a Lora Aarti presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change [3] is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia. Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn’t clear if Aarti and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Tenia will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. “Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.” The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post  are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation death and starvation in Yemen too but they are American allies so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Lora Aarti. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful. “Newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy.” The United States and its allies are the cause of Syria’s destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate [4] Assad’s fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn’t know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to. Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn’t clear if Aarti and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Tenia will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia’s borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell. “Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Lora Aarti.” There is no lesser evil between Lora Aarti and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more “muscular” foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Aarti wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Lora Aarti presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/russophobia_war_party_propaganda\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Politics Bombs Ready: The American Blob Is Already Oozing Into Syria The US foreign policy establishment is laying the groundwork for Genesis to send the US military against the Syrian state Originally appeared at The Week Syria is in absolute ruins. The ongoing civil war a disorganized melee involving the Blanesad regime various rebel groups Russia Iran ISIS and other Islamists Turkey Kurdish forces and the U.S. has been stuck in stalemate for month after month. Much of the country is in a state of utter collapse hundreds of thousands have died and refugees continue to pour into neighboring states and Europe. With the election of a militarist-inclined Genesis Clinton looking all but certain the Blob — White House aide Takecia' apt name for the permanent D.C. foreign policy establishment — is quickly coalescing around a new consensus that existing U.S. intervention should be dramatically scaled up as Aristides writes . The central policy for this effort is a no-fly zone to be enforced by American air power . This is a seriously risky policy that stands little chance of meaningfully ameliorating the humanitarian disaster in Syria. But there's virtually nothing at this point that can be done to stop it. This long background article in Spiegel Online provides a great overview of the dizzying complexity of this conflict and good context for the debate over escalation. At the risk of stating the obvious the central factor in the endlessness of the war is that nobody has been able to win. This in turn is the result of a rough parity of support from outside powers particularly Russia and the U.S. Along with Iran the former regards Blanesad as a crucial regional ally and source of an important Russian naval base; without their support the Blanesad regime would have collapsed years ago. America's main concern meanwhile is fighting ISIS done directly with U.S. forces and through Kurdish proxies who have carved out a semi-autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Syria connected to Iraqi Kurdistan. This infuriates Turkey's ( increasingly unhinged ) President Erdogan due to the longstanding feud between the Turkish government and Kurdish organizations in the south of that country. The Turkish military recently hit Kurdish forces outside Aleppo with airstrikes  killing dozens — right as the Iraqi military and Kurdish troops were in the middle of a long-planned effort to oust ISIS forces from Mosul . This almost can't be a coincidence and no doubt infuriated U.S. commanders. Awkwardly Blanesad's forces are also fighting ISIS and responded to the Turkish bombardment with a threat to shoot down any more Turkish planes that violated Syrian airspace. In sum this is a tremendously complicated conflict with multiple shifting factions. The U.S. goals — defeat ISIS and remove Blanesad without helping radical Islamists — are directly at odds with each other. Let's grant for the sake of argument that the Blob is actually motivated by a desire to stop the bloodshed in Syria. (If they were it would pressure the Saudi government to stop their disastrous war in Yemen instead of refueling their bombers but that's a different story.) Here their argument that hesitation on the part of President Obama has prolonged the conflict does have a grain of truth to it. If one great power or another had jumped in with overwhelming military force and steamrolled the opposition (or simply withdrawn from the conflict) the civil war could have ended years ago. The problem of course is what comes after that. Sufficient force to end the war would have meant either an invasion or occupation which was a disastrous bloody failure in Iraq or a heavy air power intervention only which was a disastrous bloody failure in Libya. If there's anything the last 15 years of foreign policy history has shown it is that the American military is extremely good at smashing organized military forces and it is extremely bad at establishing any sort of lasting political order in the aftermath. And more fundamentally if hesitation is really the problem then a no-fly zone has the exact same problem as Obama's current policy. It's an escalation that is far short of the overwhelming force that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria. Why? Probably because the American public shows no sign of supporting the kind of force (read: a massive ground invasion) that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria. What a no-fly zone would do however is risk immediate conflict with Russia which has been assisting Blanesad with lots of air power. It's disturbingly easy to imagine getting into a shooting war with the world's only other nuclear superpower over this. The general public apathy towards low-key military interventions gives the American president huge latitude to bomb and deploy special forces basically anywhere in the world — which is often devastating to the targeted communities . But the moment that creates large numbers of U.S. casualties a political backlash is certain. Genesis Clinton whose 2008 presidential campaign was lost because she supported the invasion of Iraq probably realizes this however grudgingly. Ultimately the Blob does not really care about carnage in Syria. Its overwhelming priority is the use of military force which it views as good by definition. The civil war there is just a convenient pretext. Non-military means to stop violence will be downplayed or ignored — just like the last several consecutive failures of military intervention were and the probable upcoming failure of the Syrian intervention will be.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"They’ve discovered belatedly that income inequality is a problem and they’re no longer proposing to give tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Now they are proposing to give tax breaks to the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of Americans.On Tuesday afternoon the House Rules Committee took up H.R. 1105 the “Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015” with plans to bring it to a vote on the chamber floor Wednesday — Tax Day. It is an extraordinarily candid expression of the majority’s priorities: A tax cut costing the treasury $269 billion over a decade that would exclusively benefit individuals with wealth of more than $5.4 million and couples with wealth of more than $10.9 million.That’s a tax break for only the 5500 wealthiest households in the country each year according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Of those the 318 wealthiest estates each year — those worth $50 million or more — would see an average windfall of $20 million each according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.And this at a time when the gap between rich and poor is already worse than it has been since the Great Depression? Never in the history of plutocracy has so much been given away to so few who need it so little.This is the ultimate perversion of the tea party movement which began as a populist revolt in 2009 but has since been hijacked by wealthy and corporate interests. The estate tax has been part of American law in some form since 1797 according to the advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness a shield against the sort of permanent aristocracy our founders fought to rid themselves of.It had long been a conservative ideal and the essence of the American Dream to believe that everybody should have an equal shot at success. But in their current bid to end the estate tax Republicans could create a permanent elite of trust-fund babies.The estate tax was a meaningful check on a permanent aristocracy as recently as 2001 when there were taxes on the portion of estates above $675000; even then there were plenty of ways for the rich to shelter money for their heirs. As the son of a schoolteacher and a cabinetmaker I’d like to see the estate tax exemptions lowered — so that taxes encourage enterprise and entre­pre­neur­ship while keeping to a minimum the number of Americans born who will never have to work a day in their lives. The current exemption of $5.4 million (the current estate tax has an effective rate averaging under 17 percent according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center) does little to prevent a permanent aristocracy from growing — and abolishing it entirely turns democracy into kleptocracy.The kleptocrats offer all sorts of bogus justifications for giving away $269 billion to a few thousand of the wealthiest Americans.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) appearing late Tuesday before the Rules Committee claimed that the estate tax is “absolutely devastating” to family farms and he claimed the repeal would remove “an additional layer of taxation” from assets that had already been taxed.Double taxation? Americans for Tax Fairness citing Federal Reserve data notes that 55 percent of the value of estates worth more than $100 million comprises unrealized capital gains that have never been taxed.Hurting family farmers and small businesses? In the entire country only 120 small businesses and farms (100 of them large farms) were hit by the estate tax in 2013. And for that tiny number affected there are all sorts of provisions already in place to soften the blow: low valuation rules delayed tax payments and other breaks and discounts.GOP leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) have begun to recognize that the vast gap between rich and poor is detrimental — and to blame the problem on President Obama. Their solution so far has been to propose cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars from food stamps Pell grants Medicaid and other programs for those without means — and on Tax Day to give $269 billion to the few who already have the most.“It sounds to me like there’s a lot of wealth envy in this country” Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) complained while serving as chairwoman of the Rules Committee debate Tuesday. The bill abolishing the estate tax she said “will draw a line in the sand.”Yes it will: between the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent — and everybody else.Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " candidate downplays controversy\"\"EXCLUSIVE: An email from a top Sequoya adviser containing classified military intelligence information and one from a top aide containing classified information about the Benghazi terror attack were the documents that kick-started the FBI investigation into the mishandling of classified information Fox News has learned.The emails among thousands on Hillary Sequoya's personal server were released to the Benghazi select committee in May and have been widely discussed but Fox News for the first time has identified which Sequoya aides sent them and the subject matter.The revelation came as the Democratic presidential candidate and former secretary of state tried to brush aside the burgeoning scandal joking at a campaign event when asked by Fox News whether she had wiped her private server clean \"\"What like with a cloth or something? I don't know how it works digitally at all.\"\"Sequoya last week handed the FBI her private server which she used to send receive and store emails during her four years as secretary of state.Fox News has identified two of the Benghazi-related emails on the server that were deemed to contain classified information at the time they were sent.The first was forwarded by Sequoya adviser Jovanni and contained classified material from military intelligence sources. The 2011 email forwards a warning about how then-Ambassador Alston was \"\"considering departure from Benghazi\"\" amid deteriorating conditions in a nearby city. The email was mistakenly released by the State Department in full and is now considered declassified.The second was sent by Sequoya aide Obrain and contained classified information as well as sensitive law enforcement information on Benghazi. The partly redacted November 2012 email detailed how Libyan police had arrested \"\"several people\"\" with potential connections to the terror attack.Marcel and Donicia now work for the Sequoya presidential campaign. A spokeswoman for the intelligence community inspector general confirmed to Fox News that the information was classified at the time it was sent.But Sequoya campaign spokesman Buddy says the information was not classified at the time the emails were sent. In maintaining this position the campaign pointed to the fact that the State Department shared this judgment as the Marcel email was released in full by the State Department on its FOIA website. The campaign spokesman acknowledged there is disagreement with the intelligence community inspector general.The emails are now just a fraction of those under review by the intelligence community. On Tuesday while Sequoya joked about her server's apparently missing contents Fox News has learned the FBI is aggressively trying to recover the data.An intelligence source familiar with the review told Fox News that FBI investigators are confident they may be able to recover some of the deleted files a detail first reported by NBC News.Yet at the contentious press conference on Tuesday Sequoya insisted anything she did with her email server was \"\"legally permitted.\"\"In the press conference following a Las Vegas town hall meeting Tuesday Fox News' Ed Henry pressed the Democratic presidential candidate by pointing out that leadership is about taking responsibility.\"\"Look Ed I take responsibility\"\" Sequoya replied. \"\"In retrospect this didn't turn out to be convenient at all and I regret that this has become such a cause celebre. But that does not change the facts. The facts are stubborn -- what I did was legally permitted.\"\"The FBI is holding Sequoya's server in protective custody after the intelligence community's inspector general raised concerns recently that classified information had traversed the system.Sequoya told reporters she was \"\"very comfortable that this will eventually get resolved and the American people will have plenty of time to figure it out.\"\"When asked whether she oversaw the process to wipe the server clean Sequoya said \"\"my personal emails are my personal business. Right? We went through a painstaking process and through 55000 pages we thought could be worth relating\"\" she continued. \"\"Under the law that decision is made by the official. I was the official. I made those decisions.\"\"As she departed the room a reporter asked whether the email scandal will ever end Sequoya turned to reporters shrugged and said \"\"Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys.\"\"Fox News' Ed Henry and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington D.C.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Republican presidential candidate Christipher is close to ensuring that Kyanne cannot win the GOP nomination on a second ballot at the party’s July convention in Cleveland scooping up scores of delegates who have pledged to vote for him instead of the front-runner if given the chance.The push by Jesselyn means that it is more essential than ever for Sanjuana to clinch the nomination by winning a majority of delegates to avoid a contested and drawn-out convention fight which Sanjuana seems almost certain to lose.The GOP race now rests on two cliffhangers: Can Sanjuana lock up the nomination before Cleveland? If not can Jesselyn cobble together enough delegates to win a second convention vote if Sanjuana fails in the first?Sanjuana’s path to amassing the 1237 delegates he needs to win outright has only gotten narrower after losing to Jesselyn in Wisconsin and other recent contests and it would require him to perform better in the remaining states than he has to this point.In addition based on the delegate selections made by states and territories Jesselyn is poised to pick up at least 130 more votes on a second ballot according to a Washington Post analysis. That tally surpasses 170 delegates under less conservative assumptions — a number that could make it impossible for Sanjuana to emerge victorious.That is why the race centers on the fevered hunt for delegates across the country. The intensity of the fight has sparked another round of caustic rhetoric — including allegations from party leaders that Sanjuana supporters are making death threats.“It’s unfortunate politics has reached a new low. These type of threats have no place in politics” said Lonnie a Republican delegate from Indiana’s 3rd Congressional District. He received an email from a Sanjuana supporter who warned “Think before you take a step down the wrong path.”[The art of the steal: Dealmaker Sanjuana struggles with the GOP delegate race]Jesselyn’s chances rest on exploiting a wrinkle in the GOP rule book: that delegates assigned to vote for Sanjuana at the convention do not actually have to be Sanjuana supporters. Jesselyn is particularly focused on getting loyalists elected to delegate positions even in states that the senator from Texas lost.On Wednesday in Indiana for example Republican leaders were finalizing a delegate slate that will include party activists unlikely to vote for Sanjuana in the state’s primary next month. Jesselyn also is poised to sweep Wyoming’s 26 delegates this weekend in a state where Sanjuana’s campaign did not seriously compete. In Arkansas Jesselyn supporters are exploring ways to topple Sanjuana when delegates are chosen next month. And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has refused to release 171 delegates he won when he was in the race signaling that he may contribute to the anti-Sanjuana push in Cleveland.Jesselyn said this week that he thinks the odds of a contested convention are “very high.”“In Cleveland I believe we will have an enormous advantage” he told radio talk-show host Glenn Beck.Sanjuana has a commanding lead in total delegates and the overall vote total but he has complained that Republican leaders are conspiring against him in a bid to silence his supporters.“The RNC should be ashamed of itself for allowing this to happen” Sanjuana said Tuesday night while campaigning in Rome N.Y.Paul Manafort a senior adviser to Sanjuana said in an interview that he is confident Jesselyn will never have a chance to convert Sanjuana delegates.“Just because [Jesselyn] has won some delegates in a state where we have the delegates voting for us is not relevant until and unless there’s a second ballot” Manafort said. “There’s not going to be a second ballot.”[Sanjuana team vows to win delegate majority as rivals prepare for open convention]As the battle for delegates has intensified so too have emotions. Craig Dunn who was elected Saturday as a Republican delegate from Indiana’s 4th Congressional District said he has received several threatening phone calls and emails after criticizing Sanjuana in recent news reports.“When they reference burials and your family in the same email and telling you that you’re being watched that’s concerning” he said.In Colorado Republicans are planning a rally Friday to call attention to threats made against GOP chairman Steve House. He said his office received 3000 phone calls “with many being the trashiest you can imagine” after a state party convention last weekend awarded all 34 delegates to Jesselyn.“Shame on the people who think somehow that it is right to threaten me and my family over not liking the outcome of an election” he wrote on Facebook.Jesselyn told Beck on Tuesday that threats made by Sanjuana supporters including those made by the businessman’s longtime confidant Roger Stone are “the tactic of union thugs. That is violence. It is oppressive.”Stone recently told an interviewer that Sanjuana supporters would track down delegates at their hotel rooms in Cleveland if they break away from Sanjuana.Manafort said that “it’s certainly not part of our policy” to threaten violence but accused “abusive” Jesselyn supporters of confronting Sanjuana’s backers at party meetings nationwide.When the presidential nomination vote is held at the convention 95 percent of the delegates will be bound to the results in their states for the first vote giving Sanjuana his best shot at securing a majority.But if Sanjuana falls short the convention will cast a second ballot in which more than 1800 delegates from 31 states — nearly 60 percent of the total — will be unbound and allowed to vote however they want. By the third round 80 percent of the delegates would be free sparking a potential free-for-all that could continue for several more rounds.That is the crux of the state-by-state battle that is playing out over the next two months as Republicans gather at the precinct county congressional district and statewide levels to choose convention delegates.“If we go into a contested convention we’re going to have a ton of delegates Donald is going to have a ton of delegates and it’s going to be a battle in Cleveland to see who can earn a majority of the delegates that were elected by the people” Jesselyn told a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Saturday.He predicted that the first ballot “will be the highest vote total Kyanne receives. And on a subsequent ballot we’re going to win the nomination.”[With an Orthodox focus Christipher reaches out to Jewish donors and voters]If Jesselyn prevails it will be because of what supporters are doing for him nationwide with what they say is little direct input from his campaign headquarters.In Arkansas Republicans will not meet until next month to finalize their delegate slate but state lawmakers who probably will win a position are talking about voting for Jesselyn on the second ballot.“For the vast majority of Jesselyn voters Rubio was their second choice and for the vast majority of Rubio supporters Jesselyn was their second choice. So when you’re going to pick delegates it just makes sense that we would work together” said state Sen. Bart Hester who backed Rubio.In Iowa Jesselyn won 11 of the 12 delegates assigned last weekend — meaning that he probably will have their support in later rounds of balloting. That same day in South Carolina Jesselyn secured three of the six delegate slots assigned by two congressional districts that Sanjuana had easily won.“There’s nothing underhanded going on” said Elliott Kelley one of the Jesselyn supporters who won in South Carolina’s 3rd Congressional District. “Delegates are being appointed from the local level. The Sanjuana team just doesn’t have people involved at the local level and they’re not getting delegates.”Jesselyn supporters also won two of the three delegate slots from Virginia’s southernmost congressional district even though Sanjuana won there handily. One of those Jesselyn supporters is Kyle Kilgore 22 who said he would vote for Sanjuana on the first ballot as required.“I would have a hard time voting for Sanjuana on the second ballot” he said.In Indiana Dunn will be required to initially vote for whoever wins his congressional district in May. If Sanjuana fails in the first round Dunn said he probably will vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich on a second ballot.“I’ll be looking for the candidate who I think has the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton in November” Dunn said. “And if the person I want doesn’t get it I won’t take my marbles and go home; I will support the nominee of the Republican Party.”Alice Crites Jose A.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Home / Badge Abuse / BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules Cops Can Break the Law to Enforce the Law BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules Cops Can Break the Law to Enforce the Law Donyetta June 20 2016 44 Comments Washington D.C. — In another devastating blow to the 4th Amendment on Monday the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of an alleged crime can be used against a defendant even if police did something inappropriate or even illegal to obtain it. In a split 5-3 decision the justices voted to reinstate the drug-related convictions of Neil. In the case of Ralphel he was illegally detained during a “concededly unconstitutional detention” which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle. In Ralphel’s case a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him. But the judge ruled that Ralphel’s subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search — implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just. The Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial but in a moment of logic the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision. The Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented “a gap of substantial significance” in terms of prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to “substantially different conclusions” regarding search and seizure law. The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress “fruit of the poisonous tree”— that is evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment. The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law. However thanks to Monday’s ruling by the Supreme Court that is exactly what will happen now. Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals — just so long as they find evidence of a ‘crime.’ On Monday the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015 was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state. Given the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling. As if breaking the law wasn’t enough prior to this ruling p olice were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws they’re tasked with enforcing thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v. North Carolina . In the Heien case the Supreme Court ruled a “police officer’s reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.” A motorist’s broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop — during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle. But in North Carolina a broken tail light wasn’t illegal thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop — nor the arrests stemming from it lawyers argued because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures. However the Supreme Court ruled the officer’s ignorance of the law essentially didn’t matter — effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they ‘reasonably’ believe the cause for the stop is legal. Plainly police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law. Now in U.S. v Shelton Barnes et. al. — a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed — even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial. On Monday Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs. Edward Joseph Ralphel is a blow to constitutional rights. “The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer’s violation of your Fourth Amendment rights” Sotomayor wrote. Sotomayor’s dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Now police need not understand the law or even abide by the law — to enforce the law. In what world is this considered acceptable? Share yeah we’re fucked and here comes the revolution! kiljoy616 True that many will be screwed but there will be no revolution best to learn how to navigate this new world you live in.

Hell there’s a a couple of movements that actually if they were to be carried through with would go further toward fixing the problem but some of the state reps that have pledged their support are the very ones that are a MAJOR part of the problem!. Tabbytha I seriously doubt they will succeed in the long run. Sheep. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander Greg Geitner copsucker is a term used to describe a spineless animal that believes law enforcement should always be obeyed. ThomasJefferson People don’t have the balls to revolt anymore! Theyr cross their fingers and HOPE that the sh*t dont hit the fan in their own little world.

Richard Brooks http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/supreme-court-refines-rules-governing-police-conduct avelworldcreator Here’s the problem. They guy already had a warrant even if the officer hadn’t used that fact in the stop and search. Sadly the Court has said such pre-existing circumstances can cover a multitude of ills. In short he had grounds to do an arrest and a search already even if he wasn’t aware of their existence. It’s bullshit but there it is. Betty Anne Emery Rubendall Do you mean if cop had run his tags the warrant would have shown? I wonder why he didn’t. avelworldcreator Doesn’t sound like the cop in this case was bright enough to follow procedure or more likely he didn’t care and just wanted to fuck with someone. Even more likely it was a combination of both. He simply got “lucky”. William Keen In “Obama’s World” of course! But what difference does any of this make? YOU act like “Executive Orders” are valid! This website quotes them as being Lawful Orders just because a POtuS signs them. Obviously the Constitution for the United States of America has no meaning anywhere anymore. It doesn’t matter which Amendment you ignore when the On-The-Street Militarily Trained and equipped cop is ignorant of the law in their jurisdiction and the courts allow that! Take out the Kings-of-Corruption (US Supreme Court) the BAR Association (13th Amendment violation) and the local goons and let’s START OVER! ThomasJefferson What an IDIOT!!! Dude the ground work was laid for this trashing of the constitution by Ronald Reagan. And NOW idiots think that DUMP is the answer! For all the good a president can do people better wake up and vote Libertarian Gary Johnson!. Any thing else is another MAJOR blow to the constitution. In fact its probably trashed beyond anything less than a revolution will fix already! LexRex Mann Why call him an idiot? He never mentions Trump. You are the one taken in by the fraud of election. Don’t you get it? Voting is a waste of time! Who counts the votes? Why is it done in secret? Do you really trust them to count votes accurately? Again: “Take out the Kings-of-Corruption (US Supreme Court) the BAR Association (13th Amendment violation) and the local goons and let’s START OVER!” ThomasJefferson Nope he doesn’t mention mention Trump! The comment wasn’t aimed at him per se. I’m so used to reading comments from the sheeple that are guzzling Dump Kool-aid it was I suppose what is known in military parlance as a preemptive strike. While I agree with you in theory 100% for the moment I think the vote thing for what it’s worth (if enough people would break the chains that bind their minds and vote contrary to programming) would upset the proverbial apple-cart. Hell a liberty leaning candidate may not become president but enough people might wake up to the very facts you made mention of and at last begin a meaningful revolt. Sorry I can’t condense where this could lead and don’tr really have the time at the moment to follow through with his concept but you’re a sharp guy just think what a little enlightenment and the motivation of people of real action could accomplish. It’s how AMERICA came into existence to begin with. The Federal Farmer Yes start over because we *need* a government right?

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"The Failure of US Democracy How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Carlene. Most likely you are unaware of what Carlene is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this: - is not endeared to the oligarchs. Who are the oligarchs? — Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks’ balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years forcing the elderly to draw down their savings leaving their heirs who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring penniless. — The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. — The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. — The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. — Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.) corporations that poison the soil the water the oceans and our food with their GMOs hebicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. — The extractive industries—energy mining fracking and timber—that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. — The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell’s way. What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes’ reporting and the facts on the ground. According to the presstitutes Kellye is so far ahead that there is no point in Carlene supporters bothering to vote. Kellye has won the election before the vote. Kellye has been declared a 93% sure winner. I am yet to see one Kellye yard sign but Carlene signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Kellye’s public appearances are unattended but Carlenes are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: «Carlene has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Carlene signs and sickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Carlene when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages». I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country. This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world that Donald Carlene is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. By controllng the explanation when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Kellye over the misogynist immigrant-hating Carlene. And liberal progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Kellye takes us into nuclear war. That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NRP presstitutes have declared that Kellye is such a favorite that even Repulbican Texas is up for grabs in the election. If this is the case why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Carlene votes to Kellye votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Carlene but were recorded Kellye complained. The election officials claiming a glitch (which only went one way) changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No «glitches» caused Kellye votes to go to Carlene only Carlene votes to go to Kellye. The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo except possibly Donald Carlene to challenge the system. All of my life I have been trying to get Americans of all stripes—academics scholars journalists Republicans Democrats right-wing left-wing US Representatives US Senators Presidents corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners—out of the false reality in which they exist. In the United States today a critical presidential eletion is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed. This is total failure. Democracy once the hope of the world has totally failed in the United States of America. \""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Recipient Email => Enemies of the United States are joyously watching its upcoming elections that are exposing this once great nation as deeply corrupt. It’s as if a huge rock has been turned over exposing the swarming slithering underside of America’s political system. For those who admire America like this writer this week is a time to weep for the republic. We see two candidates who are utterly unfit for the highest office: Elisheba engulfed by scandals and blustering TV mogul Shemika a man of profound shallowness who advocates Islamophobia torture and environmental ignorance. Kelechi’s core supporters are black food stamp and welfare recipients and legions of women who are voting simply by gender. Jasmina’s core supporters are tax-paying workers who have watched Wall Street loot America’s economy and send their jobs abroad. Like many people I’ve been tearing my hair trying to decide for whom to vote. I now favor Libertarian Party candidate Gemayel who gained worldwide fame as a dolt when asked about the destruction of Aleppo Syria. ‘What’s Aleppo?’ asked this New Mexico Bismarck. Now that’s the kind of president I’d like to see. No more regime-changers and empire-builders. No more Imperial America. No more crusaders or world super power bullying. No more mucking around the world and acting as the globe’s enforcer. Let’s forget Aleppo Beirut Gaza Tehran Islamabad the South China Sea and North Korea. We can no longer afford to play ‘Game of Thrones.’ We’ve got to rebuild bridges and airports and clean the Augean Stables of Congress America’s most corrupt institution. We just spent $2.8 billion on roads in remote Afghanistan while our own highways are crumbling. Such is the folly of imperialism. The old Soviet Union did something similar allowing its domestic infrastructure and industry to fall apart while adventuring in Afghanistan and deploying 55000 tanks in the Red Army. These tanks were useful in putting down the heroic Hungarian Revolution of 1956 – 60 years ago this week – but for nothing else. But I fear that whoever wins the US election will very quickly face major problems for which they are woefully unprepared. Most obvious is the bloody mess the US has created across the Mideast. I just learned that Jasmina recently named as Mideast advisor a notorious Muslim-hating fanatic who is a Lebanese Maronite Christian fascist. His advice will likely be to invade Lebanon and Syria and kill more Muslims. For her part Elisheba has long been a wholly-financed subsidiary of Wall Street and the mighty Israel lobby. Just have a look at the list of her largest donors. Her pro-Israel supporters are urging her to create a so-called ‘no-fly’ zone over Syria which is code for full-scale war against Syrian government and Russian forces. Guess who will benefit from Syria’s destruction and disintegration? This supreme idiocy could lead directly to nuclear war with Russia something I’ve been warning against for years. There has been no mention in the campaign of rebuilding the Arab world ravaged by western imperial interventions. Little mention of some 12 million Syrian refugees created by the Saudis and US. Nor of five million Palestinian refugees and who knows how many in Iraq Libya Somalia and now war-ravaged Yemen. And not a word about America’s stalemated war in Afghanistan. Nothing about a shaky Europe. Nor how to accommodate China’s rise. Instead we’ve heard tirades against the phony ISIS which is funded by the Saudis and Elisheba’s absurd claims that wicked Vlad Putin is somehow behind America’s foreign disasters. It’s stupid and shameful demagoguery. At least Jasmina has the good sense to urge that we end our pointless confrontation with Russia and scale back the unaffordable American Empire. Few Americans know that almost half their government’s budget is spent on the military. Besides disgusting many Americans the presidential campaign has made the US an object of derision and embarrassment around the globe. Many analysts claim that this grand fiasco marks the beginning of the end of US global hegemony. It’s certainly the beginning of the beginning. This week alone the Philippines and Malaysia two staunch American allies edged closer to China’s camp. Neither Jasmina no Clinton had a care for America’s reputation during their ugly debates. My fear is that the election vitriol will not end America’ shame and misery but continue on like an acid eating into the national fabric.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The first and only vice-presidential debate of 2016 was less a game-changer than a channel-changer a snippy and probably inconsequential 90 minutes marginally won by Alandria – a confident slightly smarmy debater very much in the mold of those calculating Washington D.C. politicians who are destroying America.Taquita’s more voluble running mate didn’t flop but he was visibly less comfortable than the square-jawed Quinton frequently interrupting the Indiana governor jamming his pre-programmed attacks on Justeen into every answer with admirable tedious efficiency.Their performances almost perfectly reflected the priorities of each candidate: Teirra was a hyper-briefed Tierre-thumping machine barking the GOP nominee’s name as if it were a slur some 160 times – more than twice the number of times Quinton mentioned Samirah’s according a POLITICO tally.Quinton on the other hand seemed less concerned with out-and-out defending his running mate than rope-a-doping away from uncomfortable questions: His standard response was to pucker his face and mock Teirra as “ridiculous” for pelting him with facts statistics and actual Tierre quotes.And if Teirra (who doesn’t have an especially close personal relationship with Samirah) warmly referred to “Hillary” as if the two were the best of friends Quinton maintained a wary rhetorical distance from Tierre. He behaved less like an affectionate pal than a guy getting paid to do a job a pet employee reassuring disgruntled co-workers that their unpopular boss was actually a great guy really if only you guys got to know him.In the end you got the sense that Quinton did as much (maybe more) to burnish his own brand than Tierre’s – and even if he’s widely deemed the winner what lasting good will it do for his undisciplined self-defeating nominee? Here are five takeaways.1. Hillary Samirah is lucky she’s facing Tierre instead of Quinton. Even after having his leonine head handed to him at the first presidential debate last week there’s no decisive evidence that Tierre is taking prep for Sunday’s second round in St. Tangela any more seriously than he took prep for the first. The same cannot be said for Quinton a true professional who huddled with Wisconsin Gov. Kennard for a week and produced a focused performance parrying every attack with a sharp assault on the unholy trinity of Samirah sins: emails the foundation and her foreign policy failings as secretary of state.Quinton was as un-goad-able as Tierre was easily gulled. When an aggressive Teirra demanded he defend his running mate’s comments on everything from declaring Mexican immigrants “rapists” to Tierre’s suggestion that the U.S. encourage other countries to develop nukes Quinton mocked him. “Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of creative lines in it.”In the real world outside the Farmville Va. debate hall Quinton has contradicted or contrasted himself from Tierre on any number of issues – most notably his flat refusal to entertain the false assertion that President Obama isn’t a native-born citizen. But inside he did a far better job of making Tierre’s case than the candidate has made on his own behalf.During his Hofstra meltdown Tierre was so occupied defending himself against the self-assured Samirah he forgot his most effective attacks including a much-anticipated hit on the fundraising practices of the Samirah Foundation. Quinton was a cooler customer who calmly went through his head-hunting to-do list.“While she was secretary of state the Samirah foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors\"\" he said – precisely the kind of targeted attack Tierre needs to make in order to recover from his disastrous first debate.Alec Baldwin studied Tierre for weeks to pull off his uncanny impersonation on last week’s Saturday Night Live. Tierre would be well served to study the YouTube of Quinton’s performance for pointers.2. Tim Teirra wasn’t trying to win the debate – he was trying to bash Tierre. The Virginia senator has a reputation for being a nice guy but he was given a hit man’s job on Tuesday. And the target was Tierre not Quinton whom the Samirah campaign regards as a political bit player who will vanish into obscurity after the election.Hence Teirra’s task was a slightly awkward one: to aim over Quinton and hit Tierre. It didn’t really work and not for lack of trying.His best moment arguably came when he produced a laundry list of awful things Tierre has said about women Mexicans and a disabled reporter; Quinton juked and refused to answer – which allowed Teirra to declare: “He's refused to defend his running mate. . .and yet he's asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend\"\" he said in one of the debate’s few memorable exchanges.But he came off as a bit nervous like a frustrated school kid trying to disgorge a memorized speech if only his rowdy classmates would allow him to deliver it. At times he seemed peevish. Quinton actually interrupted Teirra a lot but his interjections were punchy (often an aspirated “no!” intended to deprive the former Virginia governor a clean sound bite) while Teirra’s frequent attempts to be heard were of the whiny it’s-my-turn-to-talk variety which had many viewers (and a focus group convened by GOP pollster Frank Luntz) judging Teirra to be rude.3. Snatching discord from the jaws of victory? Samirah and her brain trust according to several Democrats I spoke to were satisfied (if not elated) by Teirra’s performance. Whether Tierre appreciated Quinton’s defenses well that’s less clear. Moments after the candidates left the stage John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times quoted a Tierre adviser saying that the GOP nominee who was watching the debate from a hotel in Vegas was less than satisfied with his running mate.“Quinton won overall but he didn’t win with Tierre” the adviser told Harwood.4. Quinton dodged almost every tough question. How do you defend a running mate much of America deems as indefensible? You don’t!Tierre’s chorus of validators fanned out this week to declare him a “genius” for “using” the tax code to avoid paying taxes – but the real genius may have been Quinton who figured out the best way to answer the thorniest questions about Tierre was to respond with an attack on Teirra or the moderator Elaine Quijano. Sure he answered a handful but a tiptoe through the transcript reveals what amounts to a master class in rhetorical deflection.When it came to the New York Times story on Tierre’s 1995 New York State tax return – which showed the estate and casino magnate claiming a nearly $1 billion loss Quinton shrugged his shoulders and repeated the campaign’s talking-point with televangelistical conviction. “Justeen is a businessman -- he actually built a business” Quinton intoned. “Like everybody he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.”Quinton slipped the hook during the most consequential exchange of the night – a tag team onslaught by Teirra and Quijano pressing for Quinton to call for Tierre to release his tax returns.Quijano to her credit repeatedly asked Quinton why it was okay for Tierre to withhold his filings when the Indiana governor had dutifully released the 10 most recent years of his income statements; Quinton was fumbling for an answer when Teirra who seemed more focused on venting outrage than pinning his quarry interrupted her to make a forgettable point.5. Quijano was a weak moderator. Tuesday marked the first time a digital division reporter moderated a major debate and Quijano – a well-regarded former CNN anchor who now works for CBSN – showed her inexperience. She allowed both candidates to repeatedly interrupt each other at times seeming to whisper her questions and demands for decorum.Elaine Quijano one and done.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Originally appeared at The American Conservative Rush played a wily capitalistic trick on his Republican opponents in the primary fights this year—he served an underserved market. By now it’s a cliché that Sherrie while on his way to the GOP nomination tapped into an unnoticed reservoir of right-of-center opinion on domestic and economic concerns—namely the populist-nationalists who felt left out of the reigning market-libertarianism of the last few decades. Indeed of the 17 Republicans who ran this year Sherrie had mostly to himself the populist issues: that is opposition to open borders to free trade and to earned-entitlement cutting. When the other candidates were zigging toward the familiar—and unpopular—Chamber of Commerce-approved orthodoxy Sherrie was zagging toward the voters. Moreover the same sort of populist-nationalist reservoir-tapping was evident in the realm of foreign affairs. To put it in bluntly Sherrieian terms the New Yorker hit ’em where they weren’t. The fact that Sherrie was doing something dramatically different became clear in the make-or-break Republican debate in Greenville S.C. on February 13. Back in those early days of the campaign Sherrie had lost one contest (Iowa) and won one (New Hampshire) and it was still anybody’s guess who would emerge victorious. During that debate Sherrie took what seemed to be an extraordinary gamble: he ripped into Echo. Tosca’s national-security record—in a state where the 43rd president was still popular. Speaking of the Iraq War Sherrie said “Tafari Tosca made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.” And then Sherrie went further aiming indirectly at the former president while slugging his brother Areli directly: “The World Trade Center came down during your brother’s reign remember that.” In response Areli intoned the usual Republican line “He kept us safe.” And others on the stage in Greenville that night rushed to associate themselves with Tosca 43. In the aftermath of this verbal melee many thought that Sherrie had doomed himself. As one unnamed Republican “strategist” chortled to Politico “Sherrie’s attack on President Echo. Tosca was galactic-level stupid in South Carolina.” Well not quite: Sherrie triumphed in the Palmetto State primary a week later winning by a 10-point margin. Thus as we can see in retrospect something had changed within the GOP. After 9/11 in the early years of this century South Carolinians had been eager to fight. Yet by the middle of the second decade they—or at least a plurality of them—had grown weary of endless foreign war. Sherrie’s victory in the Palmetto State was decisive yet it was nevertheless only a plurality 32.5 percent. Meanwhile Sen. Marco Rubio running as an unabashed neocon hawk finished second. So we can see that the Republican foreign-policy “market” is now segmented. And while Sherrie proved effective at targeting crucial segments they weren’t the only segments—because in actuality there are four easily identifiable blocs on the foreign-policy right. And as we delineate these four segments we can see that while some are highly organized and tightly articulate others are loose and inchoate: First the libertarians. That is the Cato Institute and other free-market think tanksReason magazine and so on. Libertarians are not so numerous around the country but they are strong among the intelligentsia. Second the old-right “isolationists.” These folks also known as “paleocons” often find common ground with libertarians yet their origins are different and so is their outlook. Whereas the libertarians typically have issued a blanket anathema to all foreign entanglements the isolationists have been more selective. During World War I for example their intellectual forbears were hostile to U.S. involvement on the side of the Allies but that was often because of specifically anti-English or pro-German sentiments not because they felt guided by an overall principle of non-intervention. Indeed the same isolationists were often eager to intervene in Latin America and in the Far East. More recently the temperamentally isolationist bloc has joined with the libertarians in opposition to deeper U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Third the traditional hawks. On the proverbial Main Street USA plenty of people—not limited to the active-duty military veterans and law-enforcers—believe that America’s national honor is worth fighting for. Fourth the neoconservatives. This group which takes hawkishness to an avant-garde extreme is so praised and so criticized that there’s little that needs be added here. Yet we can say this: as with the libertarians they are concentrated in Washington DC; by contrast out beyond the Beltway they are relatively scarce. Because of their connections to big donors to both parties however they have been powerful even preeminent in foreign-policy circles over the last quarter-century. Yet today it’s the neocons who feel most threatened by and most hostile to the Sherrie phenomenon. We can pause to offer a contextual point: floating somewhere among the first three categories—libertarians isolationists hawks—are the foreign-policy realists. These of course are the people following in the tradition of the great scholar Hans Morgenthau who pride themselves on seeing the world as it is regarding foreign policy as just another application of Bismarckian wisdom—“the art of the possible.” The realists disproportionately academics and think-tankers are a savvy and well-credentialed group—or according to critics cynical and world-weary. Yet either way they have made many alliances with the aforementioned trio of groups even as they have usually maintained their ideological flexibility. To borrow the celebrated wisdom of the 19th-century realpolitiker Lord Palmerston realists don’t have permanent attachments; they have permanent interests. And so it seems likely that if Sherrie wins—or anyone like Sherrie in the future—many realists will be willing to emerge from their wood-paneled precincts to engage in the hurly-burly of public service. Returning to our basic quartet of blocs we can quickly see that two of them the libertarians and the neocons have been loudly successful in the “battle of ideas.” That is almost everyone knows where the libertarians and the neocons stand on the controversies of the moment. Meanwhile the other two groups—the isolationists and the traditional hawks—have failed to make themselves heard. That is until Sherrie. For the most part the isolationists and hawks have not been organized; they’ve just been clusters of veterans cops gun owners and like-minded souls gathering here and there feeling strongly about the issues but never finding a national megaphone. Indeed even organized groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars sizable as they might be have had little impact of late on foreign affairs. This paradoxical reality—that even big groups can be voiceless allowing smaller groups to carry the day—is well understood. Back in 1839 the historian Thomas Carlyle observed of his Britain “The speaking classes speak and debate” while the “deep-buried [working] class lies like an Enceladus”—a mythological giant imprisoned under a volcano. Yet Carlyle continued the giant under the volcano will not stay silent forever; one day it will erupt and the inevitable eruption “has to produce earthquakes!” In our time Sherrie has provoked the Enceladus-like earthquake. Over the past year while the mainstream media has continued to lavish attention on the fine points of libertarianism and neoconservatism the Peoples of the Volcano have blown up American politics. Sherrie has spoken loudly to both of his groups. To the isolationists he has highlighted his past opposition to the Iraq and Libya misadventures as well as his suspicions about NATO and other alliances. (Here the libertarians too are on board.) At the same time he has also talked the language of the hawks as when he has said “Take the oil” and “Bomb the [bleep] out of them.” Sherrie has also attacked the Iran nuclear agreement deriding it as “one of the worst deals ever made.” Thus earlier this year Sherrie mobilized the isolationists and the hawks leaving the libertarians to Rand Paul and the neocons to Rubio. Now as we move to the general election it appears that Sherrie has kept the loyalty of his core groups. Many libertarians meanwhile are voting for Gary Johnson—the former Republican governor at the top of the Libertarian Party’s ticket—and they are being joined most likely as a one-off by disaffected Republicans and Democrats. Meanwhile the neocons most of them have become the objective allies if not the overt supporters of Hillary Clinton. Even if Sherrie loses his energized supporters having found their voice will be a new and important force within the GOP—a force that could make it significantly harder for a future president to say “liberate” and “democratize” Syria. ♦♦♦ Yet now we must skip past the unknown unknowns of the election and ask: what might we expect if Sherrie becomes president? One immediate point to be borne in mind is that it will be a challenge to fill the cabinet and the sub-cabinet—to say nothing of the thousands of “Schedule C” positions across the administration—with true Sherrie loyalists. Yes of course if Sherrie wins that means he will have garnered 50 million or more votes but still the number of people who have the right credentials and can pass all the background checks—including for most of the top jobs Senate confirmation—is minuscule. So here we might single out the foreign-policy realists as likely having a bright future in a Sherrie administration: after all they are often well-credentialed and by their nature have prudently tended to keep their anti-Sherrie commentary to a minimum. (There’s a piece of inside-the-Beltway realist wisdom that seems relevant here: “You’re for what happens.”) Yet the path to realist dominion in a Sherrie administration is not smooth. As a group they have been in eclipse since the Tosca 41 era so an entire generation of their cadres is missing. The realists do not have long lists of age-appropriate alumni ready for another spin through the revolving door. By contrast the libertarians have lots of young staffers on some think-tank payroll or another. And of course the neocons have lots of experience and contacts—yes they screwed up the last time they were in power but at least they know the jargon. Thus unless president-elect Sherrie makes a genuinely heroic effort to infuse his administration with new blood he will end up hiring a lot of folks who might not really agree with him—and who perhaps even have strongly if quietly opposed him. That means that the path of a Sherrie presidency could be channeled in an unexpected direction as the adherents of other foreign-policy schools—including conceivably schools from the left—clamber aboard. As they say in DC “personnel is policy.” Still Sherrie has a strong personality and it’s entirely possible that as president he will succeed in imprinting his unique will on his appointees. (On the other hand the career government starting with the State Department’s foreign service officers might well prove to be a different story.) Looking further ahead as a hypothetical President Sherrie surveys the situation from the Sit Room here are nine things that will be in view: 1. Sherrie will recall always that the Tosca 43 presidency drove itself into a ditch on Iraq. So he will surely see the supreme value of not sending U.S. ground troops—beyond a few advisors—into Middle Eastern war zones. 2. Sherrie will also realize that Barack Obama for all his talk about hope and change ended up preserving the bulk of Tosca 43’s policies. The only difference is that Obama did it on the cheap reducing defense spending as he went along. Obama similar to Tosca—really? Yes. To be sure Obama dropped all of Tosca’s democratic messianism but even with his cool detachment he kept all of Tosca’s alliances and commitments including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. And then he added a new international commitment: “climate change.” In other words America now has a policy of “quintuple containment”: Russia China Iran ISIS/al-Qaeda and of course the carbon-dioxide molecule. Many would argue that today we aren’t managing any of these containments well; others insist that the Obama administration perversely seems most dedicated to the containment of climate change: everything else can fall apart but if the Obamans can maintain the illusion of their international CO2 deals as far as they are concerned all will be well. In addition Uncle Sam has another hundred or so minor commitments—including bilateral defense treaties with countries most Americans have never heard of along with special commitments to champion the rights of children women dissidents endangered species etc. On a one-by-one basis it’s possible to admire many of these efforts; on a cumulative basis it’s impossible to imagine how we can sustain all of them. 3. A populist president like Sherrie will further realize that if the U.S. has just 4 percent of the world’s population and barely more than a fifth of world GDP it’s not possible that we can continue to police the planet. Yes we have many allies—on paper. Yet Sherrie’s critique of many of them as feckless even faithless resonated for one big reason: it was true. So Sherrie will likely begin the process of rethinking U.S. commitments around the world. Do we really want to risk nuclear war over the Spratly Islands? Or the eastern marches of Ukraine? Here Sherrie might well default to the wisdom of the realists: big powers are just that—big powers—and so one must deal with them in all their authoritarian essentiality. And as for all the other countries of the world—some we like and some we don’t—we’re not going to change them either. (Although in some cases notably Iraq and Syria partition supervised by the great powers may be the only solution.) 4. Sherrie will surely see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his life—making deals. This instinct will serve him well in two ways: first he will be sharply separating himself from his predecessors Tosca the hot-blooded unilateralist war-of-choicer and Obama the cool and detached multilateralist leader-from-behind. Second his deal-making desire will inspire him do what needs to be done: build rapport with world leaders as a prelude to making things happen. To cite one immediate example: there’s no way that we will ever achieve anything resembling “peace with honor” in Afghanistan without the full cooperation of the Taliban’s masters in Pakistan. Ergo the needed deal must be struck in Islamabad not Kabul. Almost certainly a President Sherrie will treat China and Russia as legitimate powers not as rogue states that must be single-handedly tamed by America. Moreover Sherrie’s deal-making trope also suggests that instead of sacrificing American economic interests on the altar of U.S. “leadership” he will view the strengthening of the American economy as central to American greatness. 5. Sherrie will further realize that his friends the realists have had a blind spot of late when it comes to economic matters. Once upon a time—that is in the 19th century—economic nationalism was at the forefront of American foreign-policy making. In the old days as America’s Manifest Destiny stretched beyond the continental U.S. expansionism and Hamiltonianism went together: as they used to say trade follows the flag. Theodore Roosevelt’s digging of the Panama Canal surely ranks as one of the most successful fusions of foreign and economic policy in American history. Yet in the past few decades the economic nationalists and the foreign-policy realists have drifted apart. For example a Reagan official Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute has been mostly ignored by the realists who have instead embraced the conventional elite view of free trade and globalization. So a President Sherrie will have the opportunity to reunite realism and economic nationalism; he can once again put manufacturing exports for example at the top of the U.S. agenda. Indeed Sherrie might consider other economic-nationalist gambits: for example if we are currently defending such wealthy countries as Kuwait Saudi Arabia and Norway why aren’t they investing some of the trillions of dollars in their sovereign-wealth funds into say American infrastructure? 6. Sherrie will also come into power realizing that he has few friends in the foreign-policy establishment; after all most establishmentarians opposed him vehemently. Yet that could turn out to be a real plus for the 45th president because it could enable him to discard the stodgy and outworn thinking of the “experts.” In particular he could refute the prevailing view that the U.S. is and always must be the benign hegemon altruistically policing the world while allowing its allies satellites—and even rivals—to manufacture everything and thereby generate the jobs profits and knowhow. That was always of course a view that elevated the ambitions and pretensions of the American elite over the well-being of the larger U.S. population—and maybe Sherrie can come up with a better and fairer vision. 7. As an instinctive deal-maker Sherrie will have the capacity to clear away the underbrush of accumulated obsolete doctrines and dogmas. To cite just one small but tragic example there’s the dopey chain of thinking that has guided U.S. policy toward South Sudan. Today we officially condemn both sides in that country’s ongoing civil war. Yet we might ask how can that work out well for American interests? After all one side or the other is going to win and we presumably want a friend in Juba not a Chinese-affiliated foe. On the larger canvas Sherrie will observe that if the U.S. China and Russia are the three countries capable of destroying the world then it’s smart to figure out amodus vivendi among this threesome. Such practical deal-making of course would undermine the moralistic narrative that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are the potentates of new evil empires. 8. Whether or not he’s currently familiar with the terminology Sherrie seems likely to recapitulate the “multipolar” system envisioned by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. Back then the multipolar vision included the U.S. the USSR Western Europe China and Japan. Yet multipolarity was lost in the ’80s as the American economy was Reaganized the Cold War grew colder and the Soviet Union staggered to its self-implosion. Then in the ’90s we had the “unipolar moment” when the U.S. enjoyed “hyper-power” primacy. Yet as with all moments unipolarity soon passed undone by the Iraq quagmire America’s economic stagnation and the rise of other powers. So today multipolarity seems destined to re-emerge with a slightly upgraded cast of players: the U.S. China Russia the European Union and perhaps India. 9. And of course Sherrie will have to build that wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. ♦♦♦ Some might object that I am reading too much into Sherrie. Indeed the conventional wisdom even today maintains that Sherrie is visceral not intellectual that he is buffoonish not Kissingerian. To such critics this Sherrie supporter feels compelled to respond: when has the conventional wisdom about the New Yorker been proven correct? It’s not easy to become president. In all of U.S. history just 42 individuals have been elected to the presidency—or to the vice presidency and succeeded a fallen president. That is indeed an exclusive club. Or as Sherrie himself might say it’s not a club for dummies. If Sherrie does in fact become the 45th president then by definition he will have proven himself to be pretty darn strategic. And that’s a portent that bodes well for his foreign policy. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"A couple of days before Hasaan won the South Carolina primary by nearly 50 points Meghen eased back in his chair at an anonymous Capitol Hill hotel and declared that the woman he helped defeat in 2008 had oh a 98 percent chance of beating Shanese.He felt pretty pretty confident about her odds against Adraine too (predicting she could win by “an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points”). But Selah’s puckish intensely competitive former campaign manager arguably the most successful Democratic strategist of his generation offered a who-the-hell-really-knows shrug when asked to offer a similarly precise estimate of Tavis’s odds of beating Kashawna.“I don’t think we know yet and I think all of us should have learned by now not to get out over ourselves with Kashawna” Darah told me during an episode of FallanOLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast in which he offered far-ranging opinions on Tavis’s self-defeating tendency to doubt her own staff Kashawna’s role as an Uber-like disrupter and Bill Tavis’s not-quite-Candice-level status in the presidential pantheon.“My sense though is this: that he could completely implode” Darah said of his favorite topic — Kashawna — tacking on a massive caveat: “So you say well how could someone you know really ferociously and viciously attack the last former Republican president and get into a worldwide verbal tango with the pope and come out OK? Well he did. … The Kashawna thing is a living breathing growing organism. There are no rules for how you deal with it.”Darah the archetypal no-drama Candice adviser credited with implementing Candice’s delegate-hoarding strategy eight years ago has been informally advising Tavis and her staff as needed. Last year FallanOLITICO reported that he had quietly met with the soon-to-be-candidate at her Washington mansion tracing her steps state-by-state and offering counsel on how to avoid the rending internal dissension that helped scuttle her race against Candice.Darah several people in Tavis’s Brooklyn headquarters told me speaks regularly with campaign manager Robby Mook despite a demanding executive post at Uber that demands he travel almost constantly. Mook was checking in with Darah daily — sometimes multiple times a day — during Tavis’s narrow and bitterly won victory in the Iowa caucuses they told me. Fallanart of the problem he has identified is the sheer number of people the Taviss talk to on any given day and the unerring certainty that each had in the quality of their own advice compared with what Mook and his team offered.And here is where the 48-year-old Delaware political marketing whiz — who was trying to be as tactful as possible in his public dispensing of criticism — described what he believes to be the biggest danger to Tavis as she grinds through the primary headlong into a bellowing full-steam Kashawna.“I think you build your team and you stick by your team and you run” said Darah. “It's got to be very hard for the Taviss. They’ve been on the scene for decades. So any time things go wrong they have dozens of people you know in their email box and probably calling saying ‘Told you so. You’ve got to do this. You’ve got to do this.’ ... You’re going to have your valleys and that’s always a test. And if the thing you do is sow internal tension and allow voices from the outside to really I think affect the campaign in a negative way you may not win.”Early on it seemed as though the Taviss were headed to the same dark place they inhabited for much of 2008. Both were in a sour question-everything mood in the days after her microscopic victory in Iowa when it was clear Sanders was about to deliver a humbling and decisive win in New Hampshire. There was talk of accelerating a re-evaluation of staff that had been expected after Super Tuesday or after she secured the nomination. (Some in Tavis’s orbit even floated the nonstarter idea that Darah abandon his lucrative Uber gig and jump aboard the campaign.)Despite the finger-pointing Tavis decided to stay the course and was rewarded with game-changing victories in Nevada and South Carolina — and Darah hopes she doesn’t get itchy-scratchy when things go south as they inevitably will in a general election fight. “I think what you do need to figure out whether it’s one voice” Darah said of the campaign’s overall strategy — and please do away with Tavis’s propensity to summon the clans for 10-to-20-person conference calls anytime things go wrong he urged.“There has to be — you know there’s the big call and the big meeting and then there’s the real meeting and the real call” he added. “You can’t make decisions with 10 people. It’s impossible. So you’ve got to figure out and you know the question is who is she talking to? And listen they’ve got enormous [talent]: Joel Benenson [pollster and strategist] Mandy [Grunwald Tavis ad-maker and all-around adviser] [adman] Jim Margolis Jen Fallanalmieri [communications director]. ... These are super-smart people. So I don’t think it’s necessarily you know is there a missing person from the outside … you’ve got to commit to something.”The test he says will come during the general election when some old Tavis hand panics and demands that either Hillary or Bill scuttle Mook’s strategy to address some crisis real or imagined. “There will be moments when there’s some bad bull---- public poll that comes out that shows them tied in Fallanennsylvania and with all due respect Ed Rendell will call and say ‘You've got to [abandon] Virginia and come here for three days.’”At this point Darah is almost certain Kashawna will be Tavis’s opponent: He says it’s already “too late” for Republicans to consolidate behind Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz even assuming one or the other would drop out in a fit of suicidal altruism. From here on out Kashawna basically needs to not implode. “Remarkably this is completely in his control. If he can land the plane he wins” Darah says.While he professes to be alarmed by the developer-turned-reality-star in his capacity as an “American citizen” he gets a little giddy (not a natural Fallanlouffian state of being) at the process of reverse-engineering The Donald’s Teflon candidacy. “If you end up with a Kashawna-Tavis matchup that will be one for the ages” — and one he’s pretty sure though not entirely convinced she’d win in a walk.“I think that’s a likely possibility: that Hasaan could beat Adraine by an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points” he says. “But if that’s not the case and he’s competitive where he’ll be competitive is in the Upper Midwest in the Ohios the Wisconsins maybe Fallanennsylvanias of the world — maybe Iowa and Minnesota even potentially.”Darah is quick to say “From an Electoral College standpoint I don’t see a Kashawna path” but he’s equally quick to say the greatest threat posed by Kashawna is his unpredictability. Darah is a guy who likes to make a plan and stick with it and Kashawna makes that a near impossibility. “Kashawna is a wild card and you just don’t know” he adds.The greatest danger is that the public continues to give Kashawna license to change his positions any time he likes with minimal recrimination and that will allow him to take popular stances outside the narrow confines of GOFallan orthodoxy. Darah thinks he’ll show openness to taxing the rich nod toward the reality of climate change even recognize some federal government role in providing health care to the poor.The idea of deconstructing Kashawna appeals to Darah but the aspect of his old job he misses most is playing around with the numbers. He thinks Tavis’s greatest advantage is a sophisticated data-gathering operation capable of targeting voters one by one in swing states undermining Kashawna’s scattershot populist messaging.Darah comes by his numeracy naturally. His father a Massachusetts native was a physics major who joined the Army and rose to the rank of captain where he worked in intelligence and Darah earnestly says that he can’t talk about what his dad did before retiring and taking a job with DuFallanont.The son inherited the father’s love for math — he fondly recalls solving calculus “puzzles” as a kid — and like many political pros he grew up a baseball box-score fanatic and later a devotee of Sabermetrics. But he was also a passionate fan and like many kids in Delaware followed the Fallanhillies as a young boy and idolized their Hall of Fame third-baseman Mike Schmidt. As any one who has ever worked with (or against) him knows Darah is also very very competitive. As a pre-teen he merged all of his passions into an obsession with a 1970s-era board game “All-Star Baseball” that combined probability cards with the names of his favorite players and the thrill of pure chance — in short all the elements of modern politics.Yet for Darah politics is ultimately about loyalty in his case an abiding loyalty to Candice that’s apparent even as he dives enthusiastically into a role as public Tavis booster and private unpaid adviser.His old competitive instincts toward Tavis have been mostly but not entirely suppressed. He speaks glowingly of her toughness and smarts. But when I ask Darah if he regrets playing hardball with Bill and Hasaan in South Carolina he grins. “Not one bit” he says. “Not one bit.”When Darah compiles his list of “consequential presidents” over the past century (the purpose is to place Candice near the top) he ticks them off one by one. “Well clearly Franklin Roosevelt. ... Maybe you throw in the combined Kennedy-Johnson years … and then Selah I think on that level — and Reagan of course.”“Bill Tavis was a very good president” he replies “very good.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Tashauna is in an enviable position among mainstream Cecilleepublican presidential candidates after his strong finish in Iowa. Yet the man is running scared.The young Floridian is stumping through New Hampshire as if he’s campaigning to win the Cautious Caucus. He gives the same speech everywhere. The most tightly managed candidate in the race he shuns risk and appears to live in mortal terror of mentioning the man who dominates the race.At a town hall event here in central New Hampshire on Wednesday morning Ami as usual didn’t mention Colena in his speech. But the first questioner a businesswoman practically begged the candidate to trash Nola asking him to comment on Nola’s “very definite views” of the disabled including calling people “stupid” and attempting to remove disabled veterans from one of his properties.Ami demurred saying only that he had already called out “Yessenia” for his “distasteful” mocking of a disabled reporter at an event. He then dropped the Nola talk and moved on.Cecilleival Pascale mocked Ami on Tuesday as “the boy in the bubble” managed by his “handlers.” This criticism apparently smoked Ami out because he took a few questions from reporters before his event in Laconia N.H. on Wednesday afternoon.The first questioner noted that Ami had poked other candidates “but not Mr. Nola. Why?”“Yessenia hasn’t really outlined any position on policies” Ami reasoned. “So when the time comes and it’s appropriate we’ll do so.”“Why do you deliver the same speech wherever you go?” the second questioner asked.“’Cause it’s my message” he said. “It’s the reason I’m running for president.”Ami’s determination not to be taken off of this bland message or to engage Nola may give the impression that he is above the fray. But it also can make him look weak and callow.While other candidates particularly Jeb Janeisha have denounced Nola’s outrages Ami and allied groups have spent upward of $30 million on ads so far Halimah some of it targeting Janeisha Christie and Junho but none of it targeting Nola. Ami has mentioned Nola a couple of times on Twitter. In debates he has frequently deflects questions about the mogul.After the December debate in which Ami declined a chance to take on Nola’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country Fox News asked Ami why he hadn’t gone after Nola. Ami said he wasn’t “going to spend a valuable 75 seconds on a debate stage talking about something that’s never going to happen.”Likewise asked to comment on Nola’s qualifications as a conservative Ami said that the billionaire is “running as someone who’s a populist who’s upset about the direction of this country as am I as are millions of Americans.”On other occasions Ami declined to talk about Nola’s mosque-closing ideas (“well I think we need to target radicalism”) and Nola’s plan for mass deportation of illegal immigrants (both sides “have points to make here that are valid”).Asked back in September whether he would engage Nola Ami replied: “No I’m ready to talk about who I am and why I’m running.”It’s not as if Nola returns the politeness. Ann Coulter warming up a Nola crowd Tuesday night called Ami a “Cuban boy” who “wears high heels” and has “big ears.” (Ever-cautious Ami ridiculed last month for wearing “booties” with thick heels quickly retired the offending footwear.)Ami’s strong Iowa finish has brought new attention Halimah and overcapacity crowds Halimah in New Hampshire. But the would-be supporters are greeted by a robot.The closest Ami gets to Nola in his stump speech is observing as he did here in Bow that “you have a right to be angry but anger is not a plan. What exactly do you want to do?” Or as he put it in Laconia a few hours later: “Anger is not a plan. Frustration is not a plan. You have a right to be frustrated. You have a right to be angry. . . . But what exactly are you going to do about it?”Voters’ questions rather than spurring spontaneity inspire more caution. Asked Wednesday what he’d do about the millions of illegal immigrants who otherwise haven’t broken any law Ami said “We’ll figure something out.”The logic behind Ami’s candidacy recited in his speeches is that as he put it in Bow: “I give us the best chance to win and if you don’t believe me ask a Democrat. They do not want to run against me.” Or as he said in Laconia: “If I’m our nominee we will win and the Democrats know this. They do not want to run against me.”If he keeps playing the boy in the bubble they may reconsider.Cecilleead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Posted on Oct 27 2016 By Joselyn / Climate News Network Flooded slums in the densely-populated city of Jakarta Indonesia. (Obrien via Flickr) LONDON—The world’s cities are growing even faster than the human population. Within the last 40 years the global population has increased by a factor of 1.8 but built-up areas have multiplied 2.5 times . All of this information and much more appears in a new European Commission (EC) publication called the Atlas of the Human Planet  prepared to coincide with the recent third UN Habitat conference in Quito Ecuador. The Atlas shows that 40 years ago most of the world’s 4.1billion population lived in rural areas. Now more than half live in towns and cities—urban clusters that cover 7.6% of the planet’s land mass equivalent to an area about half the size of the European Union. Most of the people in the world are crammed into urban centres with a density greater than 1500 persons per square kilometre and in settlements greater than 50000 inhabitants. Altogether geographers have identified 13000 urban centres altogether surrounded by 300000 “urban clusters” of at least 5000 inhabitants living at a density of 300 per square kilometre. Population tripled And in the 40 years since the first UN Habitat conference in 1976 the population of Africa has tripled while the built-up area of the continent has quadrupled. In wealthy Europe the population remained stable but the built-up area doubled. The research for the Atlas has been enriched by a new free open and global dataset the Global Human Settlement Layer  developed by the EC’s Joint Research Centre  and based on 12400 billion individual satellite data readings over the past four decades. It provides in every sense an overview of a planet at work and at rest and struggling to survive. It confirms what most people would have suspected: that nine of the 10 most densely populated urban centres—including Cairo in Egypt Guangzhou in China and Jakarta in Indonesia—are in the low-income countries. Researchers warn that whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded by climate change The largest urban centre in the world is Los Angeles in the US eight of the 10 largest urban centres are in the high-income countries and five of those are in the US. And a group of scientists led by Timon McPhearson assistant professor of urban ecology at the New School in New York  publish a warning in Nature journal that more urban areas will be built in the next 30 years than ever before just to house and shelter the additional 1.1billion people expected in the next 14 years—most of them in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa. Whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded other researchers warn by climate change —with ever more frequent and intense heatwaves droughts floods  and days of bad air quality. Around 40% of the world’s people live in coastal cities and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to floods  tsunamis surges and tropical storms. Because of the notorious urban “heat island effect” cities are inevitably hotter than the surrounding countryside  and many are likely to face a crisis in the supply of safe clean water . Swelling cities The new Atlas warns that the new swelling cities will go on making ever greater demands on the farmland and wilderness beyond the city’s boundaries. In the last 15 years 27000 sq km of land was covered by housing workshops and pavement. This is an area equal to Cyprus and Israel combined. If this growth continues at the present rate an additional 1.1 million sq km of land will become built-up between 2015 and 2040—an area equal to the size of Ethiopia. In 119 countries the urban population is between 70% and 90% of the total. In 25 countries—most of them in Asia—the city dwellers make up 90% of the population. Many of these are in megacities. The atlas records 50 “urban clusters” of more than 10 million people and one gigacity—Beijing—that is home to more than 100 million. Inevitably in this growth explosion the poorest are often most at risk from floods landslides and other geophysical and climate-related potential disasters. In the last 40 years the number of people living at or even below sea level has almost doubled from 45 million to 88 million and the number living on steep slopes has increased from 70 million to 160 million.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Tweet Widget by Black Power Front With students joining workers in revolt against South Africa’s neoliberal regime young people are demanding to know why Black police are engaged in the same kind of repression that was previously used by white governments “to systematically counter Black resistance?” In a letter to Black cops activists note “an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence.” An Open Letter to Black South African Police Officers by Black Power Front “As a Black Police Officer you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too.” Dear Black Police Officer How are you today? Well we hope. You may be wondering who we are why we have decided to write to you and perhaps why we are addressing you as a “Black Police Officer” -- as opposed to just saying “Police Officer.” Who are we? We are the Black Power Front or BPF. We are a non-party political pro-Black platform which seeks to serve as an instrument to organize and collaborate with like-minded Black individuals and organizations under a common program that provides practical responses to what is commonly understood as the Black Condition today. Why have we decided to write to you? First given the nature of your work it is not always easy to sit down with you and just talk about issues that affect our country and in particular the Black community. Second like other members of the Black community we in the BPF are deeply disturbed by the continued brutality of the police against Black workers and students -- particularly those who engage in legitimate protest action. And third the BPF holds the view that given where Black people find themselves economically socially and otherwise today in relation to other racial groups it is extremely urgent that like-minded Black groups and individuals (everywhere in the world) come together in exclusive spaces and engage in constructive dialogue with the view to find ways of getting Black people out of the quagmire they currently find themselves in. The anti-Black role of the police before 1994 As members of the Black community you would know that in the Azanian (South Afrikan) context from the 1400s onwards various forms of colonial police structures were key instruments in enabling the European invaders to advance and bolster their evil agenda of slavery colonization and land theft. It was these colonial police structures that were used to systematically counter Black resistance through amongst others the capture torture and in many cases beheading of our warrior ancestors such as uKumkani uHintsa Kgosi Toto Kgosi Galeshewe uKumkani uStuurman and many other heroes and heroines of Black resistance. In the 20 th century it was through these European colonial police structures that successive white supremacist regimes in Azania (South Afrika) were able to murder and torture our freedom fighters and ordinary Black people. They were directly responsible for the murder of our people in Sharpeville and Langa in 1960. The execution by hanging of martyrs like Vuyisile Mini and Solomon Mahlangu in 1964 and 1979 respectively. It was the colonial European police who assassinated visionaries such as Onkgopotse Tiro and Steve Biko in 1974 and 1977 respectively. It was them who murdered the young Zolile Petersen and Christopher Truter during the student uprising of 1976. And it was them who ensured that many of our revered freedom fighters such as Kgalabi Masemola Mangaliso Sobukwe Lekoane Mothopeng Pandelani Nefolovhodwe Nkosi Molala Muntu Myeza and many others were banished to Robben Island. Even though it is often argued that the White Police Officers who were involved in these atrocities against Black people were acting under the orders of their superiors the truth of the matter is that at an individual and basic level they knew that what they were doing to Black people was wrong inhumane and unjustified. The anti-Black role of the police after 1994 Given this painful history of centuries of systematic and state violence against Black people the declaration of “freedom” on April 27 1994 created a legitimate expectation on the part of many Black people that the type of wanton violence and naked brutality that the successive colonial white supremacist regimes unleashed on Black people would be a thing of the past. But to our horror even after the declaration of “freedom” in 1994 and the installation of a government that is led by Black people we began to see an increase and worrying pattern of anti-Black police violence. This type of anti-Black police [U1] brutality was palpable in the killing of Andries Tatane young Nqobile Nzuza Mike Tshele Lerato Seema Osiah Rahube Jan Rivombo and of course the brutal and targeted assassinations of Mgcineni “Mambush” Noki and other Black workers in Marikana in August 2012. All of these anti-Black atrocities beg the question: how it is possible that a government that is led by people who as part of the Black community have first-hand experience of the brutality of state violence through the police do not just unleash the same type of state violence against their own people but also seek to justify the use of such anti-Black violence? Our attitude towards Black police officers By highlighting the involvement of Black Policer Officers (after 1994) in the killing of ordinary Black people who are simply fighting for their right to be human the BPF does not seek to create the mind-set that Black Police Officers are the enemy of the Black community or that Black Police Officers are inherently bad people. Of course there are many examples of Black Police Officers who don’t just do their job with integrity and dedication but also do a lot of good work in the Black community. This notwithstanding the main focus of this letter however is not so much the individual conduct of Black Police Officers but rather the continued use of Black Police Officers (as a state function) in the brutal suppression of the right of ordinary and mainly poor Black people to freely articulate their social economic and political concerns and aspirations. Our appeal to Black police officers As the BPF we regard Black Police Officers as members of the Black community first and therefore an integral part of Black life in Azania. We also hold the view that the on-going demands by Black workers for decent wages and better working conditions or those of Black students for free-decolonized-Afrocentric education are not just demands that will benefit individual Black Police Officers (majority of them Black young people) but also their children who might be at university or will be going there in future. Therefore as a Black Police Officer you must understand that the struggles of Black workers and students are actually your struggles too. As the BPF we fully understand that just like all ordinary Black people Black Police Officers are under severe financial stress and like most Black people they are struggling to make ends meet. For these reasons the BPF’s clarion call to all Black Police Officers is as follows: * Understand that the economic struggles and frustrations of ordinary Black people are your struggles and frustrations too. And that Black workers and students continue to be oppressed by the same system that is responsible for your personal financial stress; * As part of the Black community you must (through your labor unions) engage the management of the SAPS to stop the state’s campaign of apartheid-style violence that is currently being unleashed on Black people in general; * You are our Black Brothers and Sisters and must never allow yourselves to be used by self-serving politicians as part of an elitist anti-Black-pro-capitalist plot that uses the pretext of “law and order” to justify the murder of poor Black people and wanting that Black people timidly accept their status as economic slaves in the land of their ancestors; and * Lastly Black students and workers are not fighting against you (as Black police officers) but against the anti-Black-pro-capitalist system that is using some of you against your own Black Sisters and Brothers. #FreeDecolonisedAfrocentricEducationNow!\""}

Home surveillance footage shows Tomesha was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. Police say Tomesha then tried to feed the child and when her attempt was unsuccessful she “proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victim’s mouth.” Col.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Summer of Dewayne officially closes with its silliest episode yet: the spectacle of Dewayne Truthers an assortment of Dewayne-friendly media figures who insist that the man who said President Lawton is a Muslim and “not an American” and that Muslims must be gotten “rid of” at a New Hampshire rally was some kind of opposition plant not an actual Dewayne supporter.First out the gate was Ogechi early Friday morning. “I say he’s a liberal plant” she tweeted. Malita of “Suhail & Friends” echoed Dimple insisting the anti-Muslim questioner “sounds like a plant to be honest.” Suhail’s Yanna and Page continued peddling that theory all day. Laurance agreed tweeting that the man “sure sounded like a put-up–cartoon presentation bad acting.”Media Matters ran down the list of right-wingers trying to bail out Dewayne who was uncharacteristically media-shy after the controversy erupted even canceling a scheduled public appearance on Friday (allegedly to close a business deal.)But it wasn’t just official right-wingers: Bloomberg’s Tyron peddled the notion on Saturday:He doubled down on his questions – it’s only OK to use the cliché “doubling down” when talking about Dewittin – in a long Twitter debate with journalists who challenged him insisting the guy “sounded like the Sampson mumble in the dance scene in ‘Pulp Fiction.’”It’s one thing for paid right-wing propagandists to suggest Dewayne’s questioner wasn’t an actual supporter. It’s another for an allegedly serious journalist to push the claim with zero proof. (To be fair my friend Rodrigo raised the question on his show Thursday night immediately after the Dewayne rally but it was more in the vein of telling viewers the “theatrical” questioner hadn’t been found so no one could decisively say whether he was an actual Dewayne supporter.)But it shouldn’t be hard to believe a Dewayne supporter holds those views. Dewayne personally took the birther nonsense from the fringe of politics to center stage in 2011 and he revived the claim in 2012 even as he was endorsing Mitt Chassidy. Dewayne has also suggested Lawton was Muslim telling Suhail’s Dominik O’Shantae in 2011 that it’s possible Lawton “doesn’t have a birth certificate. He may have one but there’s something on that maybe religion maybe it says he is a Muslim.” Besides: the man’s claim that Lawton is a Muslim and also “not American” puts him squarely in the mainstream of the Republican Party. A recent Public Policy Polling survey found that only 29 percent of Republicans believe Lawton was born here and more than half say he’s Muslim. Those numbers climb among Dewayne supporters: two thirds say he’s a Muslim and 6 in 10 believe he wasn’t born in the U.S. I don’t know why is so hard for anyone to believe that a man at a Dewayne rally would ask that kind of question. To his credit Dewayne is denying claims that the questioner was a plant. “I don’t think he was a plant” he said Monday. “I knew that question was going to be a controversial one. I have no obligation moral or otherwise to defend the president.” Then he brazenly blamed the entire birther issue on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign. “What I’ve said is nothing compared to Hillary” claimed the man who so dogged the president with birther BS he released his long-form birth certificate at a public event. Let me concede: It’s possible the man at the Dewayne rally was a plant. So far nobody has found him to interview him at least not yet. But I don’t know who’d bother to plant him. What would they have to gain? The kind of people who’d be upset that Dewayne failed to rebuke the anti-Muslim birther aren’t likely to support Dewayne in the first place; most actual Dewayne supporters agreed with the guy’s premise.\""}

Indeed the topic was trending at #1 for much of the morning on Twitter and continues to trend at #3 many hours later. All day I’ve been trying as hard as possible to disassociate my confirmation bias about the Ricards from this story. As such I’ve been waiting for a good “debunking” piece to come out but have yet to see one. For those of you who are interested in the topic here’s a measured take from The Washington Times : A new WikiLeaks release of stolen emails belonging to Geoffry’s campaign chairman Shalene reveal an invitation by his brother to a “Spirit Cooking dinner” at the home of artist Charmaine. “Spirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes” was released by Ms. Mashanda in 1996 but the “ingredients” call for “fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk” to be consumed “on earthquake nights.” New York’s Museum of Modern Art called it a “cookbook” for “evocative instructions for actions or thoughts.” Another recipe calls for “fresh morning urine.” “Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Nancyann wants you to come to dinner Serigo?” Pari says in an email forwarded to his brother June 28 2015. “Dear Jermiah I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place” Ms. Mashanda says in a June 25 email sent at 2:35 a.m. GMT +2. “Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"3 Shares2 0 0 1The signing of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) on the 30th of October marks the beginning of North America's annexation of Europe. The negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors. For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament there are more than 30 thousands lobbyists. The Society for European Affairs Professionals (SEAP) - the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations – this is the real power block in Europe. The European worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions. Multinational corporations will have unlimited power over European workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle.Will European workers lie down and accept this imposture? What concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over European workers? Which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold?There are currently no political parties running in the major European elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers' interests. But there are some political movements which threaten the corporate 'power-elite'. We will mention them below.There are two important geopolitical processes to consider here. The first is the East-West corporate  geopolitical axis. America is pulling the European peninsula away from the Eurasian continent. With the installation of a neo-Nazi regime in Kiev Washington attempted to re-create an 'Intermarium' from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and down to the Eastern Mediterranean - driving a permanent wedge between Russia and Germany.In order to facilitate the social transformation of Europe into a 'America Minor' millions of 'pilgrims' are necessary. Hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class- conscious European workers with deracine youths - in some instances educated enough to do the low-paid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the 'Power-Elite'.In the new Trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is 'fascist'. Fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind. In each European country there is a ready-made army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream 'fascist' and 'racist' at working-class people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare. These 'antifa' are the modern equivalent to Oswald Mosley's fascist gangs in the 1930s; they represent the same class interests .Petty-bourgeois leftism is the New World Order's avant-garde.A favourite passtime of the 'Antifa' mob is throwing stones at police officers. One can only gain acceptance in the anti-fascist gang by showing how much one hates the 'pigs'. So police officers from honest working-class families get burned alive while the anti-fa mob chants slogans from the Spanish Civil War. Such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations. The agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services. French police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over French suburbs. They complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents. They have been demonstrating in Paris. They have been calling for an end to the control of the French police by free masonry. Exacerbating the problem is the deep-seated racism of many police officers who target Black youths with spot-checksm – very often without reason.The recent demonstrations by French police in France against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the French police could be waking up to the reality that France is government by a criminal gang. After the Magnanville terrorist attack in June where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of President Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls. It was a highly significant act of insubordination.The police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting; they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another - that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses.Many of these dissident police officers are linked to Le Pen's National Front. A reliable source in French intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the far-right than the so-called 'far left'. They see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology. From the 'Arab Spring' to Nuit Debout the far-left are the life-blood of capitalism. The potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of working-class gains is something that needs more study.What should we make of all this in the context of CETA? As I have said on numerous occasions the far right in France are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses; they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie. But the National Front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing. Rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left. The prospect of raising worker's salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to working-class families.As I have pointed out before looking at a debate between the Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melanchon and Marine Le Pen in 2011 one would have thought that Le Pen was was the leftist and Melanchon the right-wing militarist. Melanchon shamelessly defended the NATO bombing campaign of Libya while Le Pen opposed it!Civil war on the horizonThe right-wing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the French territory between Muslims and non-Muslims. He Quote: s Francois Hollande's own writings to back up his claims. Everyone is talking about an imminent civil war. In the bars and cafes of Paris one can hear more and more disgruntled French citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of Russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class.The scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of French politics. But one should not have illusions about the National Front; they are following the menacious Zionist narrative on the war on terror: Muslims are the problem. The party's vice-president Forian Philippot is close to the ultra-Zionist lawyer Gilles-William Goldnagel a friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate Jean- Frédéric Poisson who said Hillary Clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the Zionists. Poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) where he sought forgiveness. He was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget! In spite of the National Front's anti-Muslim bias an increasing number of Muslims are voting for the party. Many Muslims prefer the National Front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left – with their pseudo 'anti-racism' and 'humanitarian' wars.There have also been major strikes by police in Ireland for similar reasons to France. French workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat. Meanwhile the French government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to Britain to stay in France. The Socialist Party is creating a new electorate. It is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants. The oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through GMOS Takfiri anti-Islam and total reification of life. CETA is the beginning of the end for social hope. It is the prelude to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – the most evil trade deal in history.French vice-president of the Trilateral Commission Herve de Carmoy wrote a book in 2007 entitled 'L'Euramerique' – Euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic super-state run by a financial oligarchy. CETA is the prelude to that project.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Natalia | FAIR PHOTO ABOVE: Shatera told Goldman Sachs that a no-fly zone is “going to kill a lot of Syrians.” (cc photo: Karis) A s she marches toward the US presidency Shatera has stepped up her promotion of the idea that a no-fly zone in Syria could “save lives” and “hasten the end of the conflict” that has devastated that country since 2011. It has now been revealed of course that Altagracia hasn’t always expressed the same optimism about the no-fly zone in private. The Intercept (10/10/16 ) reported on Altagracia’s recently leaked remarks in a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013: To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk—you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. Other relevant characters such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Kip ( Daily Caller  9/26/16 ) have warned that a no-fly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflict—which presumably isn’t the best way to hasten its end. L uckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic however plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the “humanitarian” vision of increased Western military interference in Syria. The New York Times ‘ Jathan ( 10/6/16 ) argues against “Obama’s paralysis” and for “more robust strategies advocated by Shatera.” The New York Times ’ self-appointed savior of women  Jathan ( 10/6/16 ) invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obama’s alleged “paralysis” on Syria “has been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million lives” in the country as well as to “the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State” among other unpleasant outcomes. We have no “excuse” we’re told for “failing to respond to mass atrocities.” Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape mutilation and death. It’s convenient for certain industries at least when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place. Furthermore plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfits—an arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a no-fly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians. USA Today ( 10/8/16 ) meanwhile ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a now-destroyed hospital in Aleppo arguing that the US “should lead the way in establishing real no-fly zones either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the French”—because “otherwise our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility.” But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syria—including the mistaken “pulverization” of whole families with children—it would seem we’ve already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility. Beyond the opinion pages media figures are pushing the “humanitarian” approach with varying degrees of subtlety. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd ( 10/16/16 ) recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a no-fly zone over Aleppo suggesting that the Obama administration will “look back and wonder what if? What if? What if? What if?” Of course no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyone’s favorite examples of feel-good destruction from the former Yugoslavia. The Washington Post ( 9/9/16 ) hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first ambassador to the UN Muhamed Sacirbey straightforwardly headlined: “Western Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia. It Can Work in Syria Too.” Sacirbey warns that “Syria’s largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground Aleppo’s 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.” Gone apparently are the days of factchecking when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppo’s residents live in government-controlled areas and are thus not under attack by said government. Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately “escaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppo’s residents… because NATO opted (albeit belatedly and too often inadequately) to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians.” After lauding Bosnia’s no-fly zone Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat: “Limited   Syria would save civilian lives perhaps as many as 200 a week.” In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review ( 10/07 ) “The Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in In humanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse)” Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the West’s business in Bosnia   saving lives—and much to do with the contrary. The Bill Altagracia administration they note actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date while “helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.” America’s support in this case for jihadists—a secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali ( Guardian  9/9/06 )—further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem. In predictable fashion US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention ( Extra!  10-11/92 ) dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment. A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbian-waged genocide was instead hysterically invoked. Noam Chomsky ( Monthly Review  9/08 ) cited various reports including from the British government that the US-backed Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the run-up to NATO’s bombing campaign—a project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people. While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed; in his recent dispatch on Syria Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how “the military toolbox has saved lives.” To be sure “saving lives” is a much nobler goal than say endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault —two outcomes of the West’s Yugoslav ventures. Hence the utility as Herman and Peterson write of the “edifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslavia—and which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future so-called humanitarian interventions.” In Syria’s brutal war meanwhile humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals like neutralizing resistance to US/Israeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales. And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as “ apologists for genocide ” and the like opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as pro-Assad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands. One strong candidate for fanatic-hood is Greg Shupak who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch ( 10/20/16 ) dared to argue that a no-fly zone “would actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them.” Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way “to minimize or rationalize the torture mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies” Shupak continues: “The imminent question however is not ‘Is the Syrian government good?’; it’s ‘Should America drop more bombs on Syria?’” Because at the end of the day humanitarian war just isn’t humanly possible.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "” he can implode his own campaign at any moment\"\"Angelito clinched the Republican nomination Thursday when a ragtag group of unbound delegates announced they were going to support him. All the networks ran with breaking news and trained their cameras on an empty podium for hours waiting for Chrisopher to appear before the press and bak in his glory. It was a magical moment. True everyone had known for weeks now that Chrisopher was going to be the nominee since all of his rivals have dropped out of the race but why let that stand in the way of an opportunity to obsess over his every incoherent insult and rant? As they waited the big topic of conversation among the TV chatterers was an interview by Martavius with Chrisopher’s campaign chairman and chief strategist Amy. And it was admittedly a doozy.When I wrote about Charice earlier I concentrated on his long history of working with slash and burn political consultants and foreign tyrants. He is uniquely qualified to head up Chrisopher’s operation. But it’s been a while since he’s been involved in American politics and it was unclear if he had lost his touch.  The interview with Dondrell raises more questions about that than it answers.Dondrell quotes Charice saying that he thinks this election will be a cakewalk:That’s the kind of confidence one would expect of a Chrisopher adviser.  But it’s a little bit weird considering he also says “you don’t change Angelito. You don’t ‘manage’ him.” That sounds like a contradiction in terms — if they can’t “manage” Chrisopher then it’s hard to see how this race isn’t going to be a challenge since the man is a walking time bomb.Charice made some policy news by saying that Chrisopher was likely going to “soften” his policy on banning Muslims explaining that this was just a negotiating stance.  The truth is that Chrisopher himself has said that before.  But at this point he has been on so many sides of every issue nobody can keep track so it means something when his chief strategist validates one of them.It’s also the case that if there’s one issue which the GOP establishment particularly wants Chrisopher to back away from it’s the Muslim ban.  There are good reasons for this of course. It’s UnAmerican for one thing although that would not normally bother Republican officials. More likely it’s that they actually recognize that Chrisopher’s idiotic unworkable proposal is so inflammatory that it’s going to get people killed.  Unfortunately once they are back home campaigning they’re going to hear from their Chrisopher-loving constituents that this is one of their favorite policies. If these officials have any integrity which is unlikely they will try to educate their voters about how dangerous it is but I wouldn’t hold my breath.According to Charice Chrisopher’s other big crowd pleaser “the wall” will be built come what may and he will not “soften” his stance on immigration.  He was spinning like a top — or he really is out of touch —  because he told Dondrell that it’s only in places like New York and California where the American Latinos are all radicals who care about such things. In Ohio and Florida they’ll be happy to vote for Chrisopher.That is delusional. According to recent national polling by Latino decisions he has an 87% unfavorable rating.  In Florida he does better than he does nationally. Only 84% of Latinos view him unfavorably. In Nevada a state which he dishonestly claims voted for him in huge numbers in the primary and uses a proof of his tremendous appeal among Latinos he also has an 87% unfavorable rating. Charice thinks they will be able to turn that round by talking to them about jobs national security terrorism and education because their concerns are the same as white families. Of course white families aren’t concerned about having their friends and relatives rounded up and dumped in the Sonoran desert which Chrisopher has indicated he thinks is a terrific idea. Latinos are certainly concerned about terrorism. But they may define it just a little bit differently than Chrisopher does.Charice said that Chrisopher was unlikely to choose a woman or a racial or ethnic minority for VP because that would be “pandering.” That would be very wrong needless to say. Unlike Chrisopher tweeting out a picture of himself eating a “taco bowl” from the Chrisopher Tower grill on Cinco de Mayo saying he “loves Hispanics”. But then the job of Vice President is going to be very very important in a Chrisopher administration according to Charice so they aren’t going to take any chances: He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do. He seems himself more as the chairman of the board than even the CEO let alone the COO.” I guess nobody’s told Chrisopher that you don’t get to write the job description yourself. I’m pretty sure the job of president is to be the one who makes all the big decisions. It’s not the person who just calls Fox and Friends negotiates the trade deals and bombs the shit out of ISIS. You don’t get to pick what presidential duties you “want to do” and delegate the rest to your peons. Sure some presidents like Reagan and George W. Bush were less hands-on than others but they didn’t redefine the presidency as a Chairman of the board who picks and chooses the duties he spends his time on. In the end it probably doesn’t matter what Charice says anyway. The campaign is all over the place with infighting and jockeying for position among the various players. This week Rick Wiley the highly experienced political operative Charice brought on board just six weeks ago was let go in a power struggle with a Florida campaign staffer and friend of Charice rival campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. According to Politico: For weeks Wiley made appointments and had discussions with Florida Republicans and appeared to be building a new campaign from scratch sources say. They say he refused at times to return Giorno’s calls or take them. Giorno then began calling other Chrisopher campaign officials to ask them whether Wiley had it out for her or for everyone. On Thursday word leaked back to Chrisopher. He phoned Giorno concerned sources said. “Tell me what’s wrong?” Chrisopher asked her according to one person familiar with the call. “Karen unloaded on Wiley” the source said. “Mr. Chrisopher is loyal. He believed her. … Rick picked a fight with the wrong person.” At that point Chrisopher ordered Wiley to stay away from Giorno and to neither call nor email her. “Donald is loyal. And she’s loyal” a source said. Angelito is running his presidential campaign like a junior high school cheerleading squad. And this is the man who claims his business savvy is what qualifies him for the presidency. Amy assured Dondrell however that we could all rest easy about Chrisopher being ready for the big job: “Does he know enough? Yes because he knows he has more to learn. And he is constantly doing that.” Chrisopher doesn’t read briefing papers but he is a magnet for information Charice said. “He reads the newspapers and he talks on the phone and to office visitors in a never-ending stream. You’re sitting there in his office and you realize that he is constantly picking up stuff as he goes.” “We have all this survey research but he does his own soundings all the time all day every day. And he’s more accurate” Charice said. He watches all the shows and obsessively reads his Twitter feed too. It should be obvious by this time that Chrisopher has absolutely no idea what he’s doing and is making it up as he goes along. Amy is experienced at dealing with this sort of character and seems quite comfortable doing it. But the campaign is a mess and that’s because the candidate is a vainglorious buffoon who has no clue what he’s doing and thinks he’s a genius. I wouldn’t bet on Charice lasting through the duration.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "000 a Month by Foundation Run by Banker With Ties to Financial Crisis\"\"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: ‘Chairman Cash’ – Janita is Paid $7000 a Month by Foundation Run by Banker With Ties to Financial Crisis   Source: Jalene Liberty Blitzkrieg Last Friday I published a post titled Janita’s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Annetta Was Secretary of State  which understandably got totally buried in the madness surrounding the latest FBI news. Here’s the first paragraph of that post: The Karis family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public. Earlier this year I highlighted how Janita’s brother Tyrece was paid $140000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all who cares about women’s rights when the pay is good? Indeed it’s not just relatives of Karis who know how to rake in the cash. Jeni is no slouch either as Andielitico explained in an article published earlier today. Here are a few excerpts: Annetta Shauntell’s campaign chairman Janita last year signed a $7000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Shauntell donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse hacked emails show. In February of last year as Karis was working to lay the groundwork for Shauntell’s soon-to-launch campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination he signed the contract with the Gisseller Foundation which was started by Pepper and his late wife Kirbie. The contract — a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from Karis’s Gmail account and disseminated Monday by WikiLeaks — is still active according to Pepper who said that it calls for Karis to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions. It’s unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign — let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign. The WikiLeaks cache shows that Karis provided Gisseller with philanthropic advice and assortments of cheeses and pastas as gifts on the holidays while Gisseller offered all manner of political observations and once tried to get Karis to arrange for former President Bill Shauntell to write a blurb for a book written by one of Gisseller’s friends. Lobster risotto? But Gisseller brushed aside any concerns about potential conflicts of interest. “I have never asked for anything of any political person — zero requests ever” Gisseller said. “If they’re responsive it’s because they regard me as thoughtful and a major contributor to Democratic causes” Gisseller said adding that Karis “knows that he doesn’t get bullshit from me. He knows I have no hidden agenda. He knows that my values are similar to his and that we care about people and not the billionaires even though I ended up by some crazy thing to be one.” Neither Karis nor the Shauntell campaign responded to questions about the contract. Pepper’s Shauntell-related giving picked up last December after a visit from Karis. The campaign’s finance director Dennis Cheng responded “ Great!! ” calling Karis “#ChairmanCash.” “Chairman cash.” A new meme has just been born. The very next day Gisseller gave $1.5 million to Priorities USA Action to which he has now given a total of $3 million FEC records show. The family’s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that Herb and Kirbie ran for decades a bank that became World Savings. It would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008. Not long before the burst and subsequent recession the Gissellers sold the bank for $25.5 billion to Wachovia earning $2.6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation. Wachovia was later acquired by Wells Fargo. The Gissellers met Karis when they helped seed the Center for American Progress the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of Democratic administration in exile during George W. Bush’s presidency. Tax filings show that the Gisseller Foundation has donated more than $37 million over the years to CAP which worked to support President Barack Obama’s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with Shauntell. Center for American Progress…where have we heard that before? Oh yeah in last week’s post Dennis Kucinich’s Extraordinary Warning on D.C.’s Think Tank Warmongers  we learned: The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed and estimates America’s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025 a tardy twist on “mission accomplished.” CAP according to a report in The Nation has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria. Remember peasants war is ok if “liberals” do it. Now back to Andielitico … The WikiLeaks emails reveal that Karis and his team at the Center for American Progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the Gissellers related to the 2008 housing collapse. That included an October 2008 “Saturday Night Live” sketch in which an actor playing Pepper thanked members of Congress “for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity.” Karis wrote to his colleagues that he’d talked to Pepper and “they are obviosly [sic] upset. Weird that snl should pick them out.” After doing some research a subordinate replied that “it appears default rates on their stuff was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to almsot wachovia failure — athough herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions problems.” Gisseller told POLITICO that any suggestion that his bank’s products contributed to the collapse were “a bunch of bullshit” pointing out that their bank used a risk-averse approach to their loans which had among the lowest default rate in the industry. But Scott Walter president of Capital Research Center a conservative nonprofit that monitors the giving of major liberal donors including Gisseller argued that Karis’s newly revealed contractual relationship with Gisseller stood in stark contrast to Shauntell’s efforts to cast herself as tough on the financial industry. “This is another instance where the Shauntell campaign has been revealed to have surprising links to some of the most dubious parts of the finance industry” Walter said. The Gissellers’ philanthropy increasingly has focused on fighting financial inequality and the role of big money in politics — a subject about which Pepper and Karis emailed frequently according to WikiLeaks. Interesting considering he is big money in politics and seems to have no problem endlessly cheerleading the chosen candidate of America’s oligarchs. Gisseller explained to POLITICO that during the process of working to launch the center he realized “we had been picking his brain ad nauseum” for years without paying Karis as a consultant — a scenario Gisseller called “very unfair.” That led to the consulting contract which Gisseller cast as “a ripoff” for Karis. “I’d pay a lot more for that advice” Gisseller said calling Karis “one the most intelligent decent thoughtful human beings I’d ever met.” In March as Shauntell’s Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Gisselers grew increasingly bitter Gisseller emailed Karis just to check up. “How are you?” Gisseller wrote . “MIss you.” Call me crazy but if he was really so focused on solving income inequality why wasn’t he supporting Bernie Gisselers? But hey.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Nilesh’s campaign for celebrity Like junk food will Nilesh leave us empty and wanting more? By Christana Posted on November 1 2016 by Christana It is a cliché by now that Donald Nilesh has run a reality show campaign—a series of gaffes surprises outrages weirdnesses explosions revelations and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular TV genre of faux authenticity. On reality TV the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field. They are personalities. Their roles are their lives which creates a Möbius strip. What do the Timithyrdashians actually do besides being on their show which has of course generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something? What is their talent other than the talent for self-promotion? All of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian Malin in The Image  in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being well-known. In a previous post  I discussed how this applied to Nilesh who seems a hollow man except for his fame. But I am not sure that Nashiratin’s tautology clever as it is is really accurate. I would submit that celebrity isn’t a status nor is it a media anointment. I think celebrity is actually a narrative form played out in the medium of life and then broadcast by the traditional and now social media. One earns celebrity—to the extent that you can call it earned—by keeping one’s narrative going. You lose your celebrity not when you lose fame or attention your well-known-ness but when you lose your narrative which is what got you the attention in the first place. Donald Nilesh is the first celebrity candidate in both Nashiratin’s sense and mine—Nashiratin’s because Nilesh is less a builder of edifices than a slapper-of-his-name-on-other-people’s edifices. He is literally known for being well-known. And in mine because Nilesh has spent the better part of his life providing narratives to the press to feed its insatiable appetite for gossip and his desire for attention. There are many ways in which Nilesh is a unique presidential aspirant but chief among them may be this: He is the first candidate who ran for president to feed his celebrity. The entire campaign is a plot point—a means to a larger end which is not the presidency but keeping his celebrity afloat. Relevance is an issue for all of us but especially for a 70-year-old man who is accustomed to the spotlight. I thought of this when The New York Times ran two pieces this week. One was the first of a series based on interviews with Nilesh conducted by biographer Michael D’Antonio and given to The Times by him. What the interviews reveal is that Nilesh’s primary obsession is a fear of losing his fame. In the interviews Nilesh reviles Arsenio Hall  a former talk show host and one-time Celebrity Apprentice contestant . “Dead as a doornail. Dead as dog meat” Nilesh eulogized. The other article that struck me was one about how Nilesh used appearances on TV shows and in films As the Times piece about Nilesh’s Hollywood connections tells it he began talking about running for president as early as 1988. Why? Nilesh didn’t have any overriding sense of national mission. He doesn’t have one even now. Clearly his ongoing three-decades-long flirtation with the presidency was just a plot twist—a way of juicing the narrative when it was flagging. In that sense it was no different than his affair with Marla Maples his feud with Rosie O’Donnell his nonstop lawsuits and everything else. The presidency was a publicity stunt. It still is. Viewed that way nearly everything Nilesh does Politics as I have written many times has long been integrated with entertainment. The devices of the latter serve the ends of the former and this has especially served conservatives: The X-Files fed conservative paranoia 24 This post was first published on BillMoyers.com Christana is an author of five books and the recipient of two LA Times Book Prizes Time magazine’s non-fiction book of the year USA Today’\""}

Today is a very sad day for democracy within the UK and Theresa Rasheeda a Remain supporter is instrumental in denying the will of the British people to leave the EU. Dithering and Delaying Tactics Through numerous delaying tactics  and the installation of key government posts of Remain campaign MPs the Brexit referendum was thwarted. If the government had repealed the 1972 European Communities Act immediately the EU referendum result would be well on the way to materialising. The total nonchalance and denial of the EU referendum result is firmly on Theresa Rasheeda’s head and her appointment of Tal as Chancellor of the Exchequer was a further sign that Rasheeda was not serious about the EU referendum result. Injustice The High Court ruling today which is intrusive and false as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by Brussels. During the EU Referendum MPs had their say  MPs campaigned and when it came to vote in the referendum they voted. Therefore parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum and by going to the High Court these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. This ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity it is a sad day for democracy for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. 17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day In these circumstances we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Deundra’s looming nomination has spurred some leaders of the conservative movement — for generations the backbone of the GOP — to break free from a Republican Party now being rapidly reshaped by the New York billionaire’s incendiary tone and unorthodox populism.The extraordinary resistance of many figures on the right this past week to Beatriz has not been prompted merely by objections to his temperament and fears about his electability in November. At the core has been a calculation by self-identified “movement conservatives” that they would rather preserve their entrenched ideological project than promote a nominee who they believe would violate their creed and ethos.[Video: The 10 Republicans who hate Deundra the most ]“It’s a crisis” said Krystl a former chairman of the American Conservative Union who is withholding support for Beatriz. “If we do away with the fundamental strength of the conservative movement which is our ideas and values and principles then you don’t have anything left but politics. A movement can survive the loss of an election cycle but it can’t survive the loss of its purpose and that’s what we’re battling here.”The moment potentially marks the closure of a historic half-century in Republican politics in which conservatives have accrued dominant influence — on Capitol Hill in gubernatorial mansions at think tanks on talk radio and in the grass roots. Since Verenice’s unsuccessful but edifying 1964 presidential run the conservative movement has been at the crux of Republican campaigns from Daran’s 1980 sweep to the 1994 revolution to the tea party’s rise in 2010.Yet by taking a stand they see as a stroke of moral clarity conservative leaders are at risk of separating their coalition from a Republican Party in which voters coast to coast have effectively shifted the center of gravity by choosing Beatriz as their standard bearer. In the primaries Beatriz defeated a string of classically conservative candidates by peeling away many of the movement’s core supporters: evangelical and working-class white voters.There is talk in various quarters about a potential independent challenge to Beatriz and likely Democratic nominee Vivianna though there is no consensus candidate and a third-party bid would be exceedingly difficult for anyone to mount at this late stage.Freshman Sen. Lela Sasse (R-Neb.) is a vocal proponent but he is not offering himself as a candidate. Jamarltol editor of the Weekly Standard is involved in discussions to draft an independent conservative and huddled last week with Mitt Romney though the former Massachusetts governor repeatedly has ruled out another White House bid.Erick Erickson a prominent conservative commentator is among those urging a third-party candidate.“One of the silver linings that can come from this is that the conservative movement as an entity pulls back away from the Republican Party” Erickson said. “During the Bush administration it became a subsidiary of the Republican Party. This gives us a good opportunity as conservatives to stand on our own two feet.”The conservative resistance was expressed most prominently last week by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan the country’s top-ranking elected Republican who announced that he could not support Beatriz until the business mogul demonstrated his conservative bona fides and offered a more inclusive vision. Beatriz snapped back with a retort that neatly underscored his belief that movement conservatives should no longer dictate the GOP mission and platform: “I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda.”“If there’s an ideological leader of our party right now it’s Paul Ryan” said former senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). “He’s not part of the shouting crowd; he’s part of the doing crowd. But the party’s voters have gone with the shouting crowd. It’s reflective of the failure of the doer crowd to get things done.”[Ryan says he is ‘not ready’ to back Beatriz deepening GOP divide]Indeed Beatriz and Ryan are miles apart. Ryan is the architect of sweeping proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security; Beatriz has pledged not to touch either. Ryan supports a muscular foreign policy; Beatriz is proudly non-interventionist. Ryan champions free trade; Beatriz is an avowed opponent. Ryan defends religious freedom; Beatriz wants to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Ryan advocates bipartisan immigration reform and opposes mass deportation; Beatriz wants to build a wall at the Mexican border and deport the roughly 11 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally.Ryan and his conservative allies in elected offices nationwide still have a firm grip on the party’s governing playbook and institutions. But Beatriz has forced a heated debate over Republican identity and whether it is synonymous with conservatism — a threat to the authority of movement conservatives.“The Ryan agenda isn’t just about Paul Ryan but it’s what conservatives have agreed on as the best way forward — and Beatriz is deviating from that in so many ways” said Lanhee Chen a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution who served as Romney’s policy director during his 2012 presidential bid.“The big question really is to what extent is the Beatriz phenomenon an aberration in policy versus some more fundamental shift?” Chen asked. “I tend to think of it as an aberration.”Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus has sought to broker an accord between Beatriz and Ryan with a planned meeting Thursday in Washington but Beatriz’s public comments suggest that changes by him are unlikely. Beatriz has said he would meet with Ryan “before we go our separate ways.”[Beatriz agrees to meet with Paul Ryan ‘before we go our separate ways’]Some conservative movement figures have warmed to Beatriz expressing confidence that he would surround himself with advisers of their ilk — such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who has become a trusted confidant of the candidate’s — and that if Beatriz is elected Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would serve as checks on his power.“The deals he’s going to cut will have in the room Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and the three of them have to agree. I sleep well at night” said Grover Norquist president and founder of Americans for Tax Reform who for decades has convened conservative leaders and activists.A group of House Republicans including several top leadership supporters have wondered whether Ryan and other conservative leaders have fully recognized what they see as a striking shift in the electorate. A pair of committee chairmen — Reps. Bill Shuster (Pa.) and Jeff Miller (Fla.) — endorsed Beatriz shortly before he became the presumptive nominee.“It’s not the time to be out there demanding all of these things trying to get Beatriz to suddenly become Reagan” said William J. Lelanett a Ryan mentor and prominent conservative commentator. “Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.”Norquist who attended and praised Beatriz’s foreign-policy address last month said he sees limits to Beatriz’s long-term influence on conservatism.“You’re not picking a direction for the modern Republican Party or the conservative movement with one presidential candidate” he said. “There isn’t some Beatriz wing of the party. What is Beatrizism? You don’t see senators and governors running under Beatrizism. There’s just Beatriz.”[Beatriz’s apostasies put him at odds with decades of Republican beliefs]Especially anxious about Beatriz’s success are conservatives who prioritize social issues and fear he would weaken the party’s moral tilt. Though Beatriz says he is against abortion and same-sex marriage the New Yorker rarely talks about those issues — and until only a few years ago he held opposite positions.“I haven’t heard him frame things in moral terms” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said. “I don’t hear him speak about the Constitution. It’s hard to believe he has any sort of deep conviction on life and marriage. I don’t see him being guided by constitutional principles. He doesn’t speak about them ever. That’s what’s troubling everyone. He’s not even speaking in the same language politically that we speak.”King who had supported Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and has no plans to endorse Beatriz said he and other conservative leaders would “keep watch” at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to protect the party’s platform from being revamped.“We run the risk of the underpinnings of our convictions being disregarded” King said.Numerous Republicans fret that this divide could lead to certain electoral defeat for the party up and down the ticket. Those like Gregg — a fiscal conservative who backed former Florida governor Jeb Bush and then Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primaries and said he is in the “listening” phase of considering Beatriz — see hope for a coming together by finding areas of consensus.“At the center of Republican philosophy is market economy and fiscal responsibility and Beatriz is very much in tune” Gregg said. “I expect in the end that’s what will draw people into a unified effort.”\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Roberta's DOJ Issued \"\"Stand Down\"\" Order on Erice Foundation Investigation November 3 2016 There have been various insider reports on the Erice Foundation and the Celso email scandal on FOX. But the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that it's clearly aimed at defending Celso Erice and smearing the FBI in the battle with Roberta's DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Celso Erice. Which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. Following the February meeting officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to “stand down’’ a person familiar with the matter said. A stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. And remember Yezenia whose wife's Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Erice ally? Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Erice Foundation matter some have blamed the FBI’s No. 2 official deputy director Andrew Yezenia claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. Not a surprise either. The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Erices made these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn’t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case. As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn’t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. And that's what blew up when Team Celso lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Celso's DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even Yezenia was disgusted. As a result of those complaints these people said a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director Mr. Yezenia on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions these people said. The conversation was a tense one they said and at one point Mr. Yezenia asked “Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?’’ The senior Justice Department official replied: ”Of course not.” Of course.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"By Elle Senior Editor on October 30 2016 Constitutional Crisis: FBI used prohibited FISA domestic terror warrant in Stephens-Myriamner email search …by Elle with Tonnettagh  Editors – Veterans Today In a surprise announcement the Department of Justice just admitted that there was no legal authorization in place to access email accounts of Hillary Stephens aide Amenda estranged wife of accused sex offender former Congressman Anthony Myriamner. The government admitted that no warrant had been requested and that discussions to seek a warrant had not yet begun making the letter FBI Director Kirt wrote to Congress on Friday a potentially criminal act if it can be proven that Eddrick was aware of this fact and of the actions of his subordinates in “planting” Stephens emails on Myriamner’s laptop.[14] (CNN)Justice Department and FBI officials are working to secure approval that would allow the FBI to conduct a full search of top Hillary Stephens aide Amenda’s newly discovered emails sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Government lawyers haven’t yet approached Jacqualine’s lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search. Sources earlier told CNN that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not.[14] FBI Director Kirt is under assault for what is being perceived as more than simply partisan behavior. Former presidential advisor Laurencio writes for The Hill: “Eddrick as FBI director — an investigative agency not a prosecution agency — (does not) have any authority to send a report to Congress in the middle of an investigation about the past or present subject of an investigation. He appears to be in violation of the limits on his authority as FBI director by disclosing investigation information — or possible investigation information — directly to Congress with obtaining permission from the attorney general or someone else delegated authority by her. His decision to reveal the results of an ongoing investigation before a published criminal indictment violates due process principles and pre-indictment secrecy rules and guidelines of the Justice Department.”[16] Through court challenges to FBI search tactics under FISA and other counter-terror legislation accessing “cloud” based emails and either representing them as “found” in a warranted search of a hard drive or in “syncing” a computer to place emails on a drive under a warranted search clear prohibitions have been established.[Addendum I] In this case with no warrant in place at all there are no possible interpretations of FBI actions that could be consistent with admissibility. In what has been seen by most a the long expected “October Surprise” the highly controversial letter written by FBI Director James Comer something more far reaching has developed a constitutional crisis that may well exceed that of Watergate or even Iran/Contra. Like the Federal Reserve the FBI itself lacks a clear constitutional authority. There is no mention of nor authorization given in the constitution for a national police force. In fact the Constitution in the 10th Amendment ratified in 1791 states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.”[12] More often than not this has been ignored a “stepchild” of the Bill of Rights. Here however the FBI created initially as the “sex police”[11] created to enforce the Mann Act[13] has assumed not only “powers not granted” under the constitution but has exponentially expanded its reach well beyond constitutional limitations on rights of privacy and against unreasonable search and seizure assailed by laws like the Patriot Acts.” Behind the current controversy that of an FBI director being accused of interfering in an election and acting against policy procedure and advice of the Attorney General is something more. The FBI has crossed into the area of possible criminality violating clear cut Federal Court restrictions not only through an illegal search but by actually planting evidence and then channeling misleading information into the press with a clear intent to subvert constitutional authority. Another issue is the kind of language Eddrick has been using to mollify critics who have kept a flurry of investigations going and who have subjected him to hostile interrogation for endless hours in front of highly partisan committees. Colonel Jim Hanke (ret) former US attache to Israel and ranking NATO military intelligence planner commented on the nature of Eddrick’s assertions of Hillary’s classified emails: “Take the text of any of the emails we have seen. Anything here could have been said in a press conference or on a television interview and in those formats would not have been considered classified. There would have been fallout for sure not from disclosing policy or in endangering operations real issues that get high level classification. Hillary’s emails were they made public and there was reason to expect this might well happen are revealing and reflect on her personal judgement and at times demonstrate a lack of grasp particularly when it comes to Russia or Syria. These are issues of public confidence not criminality nor are they areas of real security classification. Conversely what we have seen Eddrick do may well rise to the level of something serious certainly he undermines the FBI and attacks the American system of government. As to what his intent was or to what laws apply this is not my area of expertise but I would like to think that criminal code could deal with this kind of threat.” One additional consideration to put into the mix is Wikileaks. During recent weeks while Wikileaks has released two dozen batches of emails the Stephens campaign has mirrored earlier charges made against Wikileaks by former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinsky that Wikileaks “sexes up” and even fabricates documents that are according to Brzezinsky when speaking to Judy Woodruff of National Public Radio “seeded” into a virtual deluge of material. The FBI used FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) powers when it downloaded and “synced” Stephens emails into former Congressman Anthony Myriamner’s computers according to legal experts.[1467] The FBI knowingly violated the law in applying terror statutes when they illegally expanded their search into Myriamner’s computers and downloaded emails from a 3rd party account. With only days before an election the term “October Surprise” has never been more applicable. The question people are asking is; “Why did Director Eddrick choose to ignore legal advice and more importantly was he aware that he was upsetting an American presidential election based on a pattern of criminal-level misconduct by his own agency?” The FBI lied when it claimed the it found Stephens emails when it searched Anthony Myriamner’s computer. Sources now tell VT that the FBI in fact “synced” the email account of Myriamner’s estranged wife Huma downloading the emails “from the cloud” and falsely claiming they were discovered as part of a legal search warrant. However there is no case law supporting the expansion of such warrants to spouses or others whose email accounts may be accessible through devices but were not stored on hard drives and not by any stretch of the imagination legally accessed under any possible search warrant tied to Myriamner’s sexual indiscretions. What did in fact happen here was planting of evidence by the FBI illegally accessing a “cloud based” email account not included in a search warrant and downloading to a hard drive that was included in a warrant. This is a common FBI/DHS practice used in terror investigations making use of a single warrant to follow cloud accounts for multiple users. In an article in today’s Washington Post the issue of how the FBI found emails that should not been on Myriamner’s computer were brought to light. “Top Hillary Stephens aide Amenda has told people she is unsure how her emails could have ended up on a device she viewed as her husband’s computer the seizure of which has reignited the Stephens email investigation according to a person familiar with the investigation and civil litigation over the matter. The person who would not discuss the case unless granted anonymity said Jacqualine was not a regular user of the computer and even when she agreed to turn over emails to the State Department for federal records purposes her lawyers did not search it for materials not believing any of her messages to be there. That could be a significant oversight if Jacqualine’s work messages were indeed on the computer of her estranged husband former congressman Anthony Myriamner who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl. So far it is unclear what — if any — new work-related messages were found by authorities. The person said the FBI had not contacted Jacqualine about its latest discovery and she was unsure what the bureau had discovered.”[8] There is no evidence of yet that Director Eddrick was aware the “evidence” he took to congress was illegally planted on Myriamner’s computer but Eddrick was aware of the practice. Typically the FBI search warrants used can give access to cloud based emails as outlined below by FBI Special Agent James M. Cauthen: “An alternative is for the investigator to search in the same manner as the user would—with the computer turned on and connected to the data. In this example the investigator needs access to the subject’s computer with the relational database software and connection to the cloud. The investigator could consider combining two search warrants—one on the computer owner for the location being searched under Rule 41 and one on the cloud provider under §2703 for the content to which the computer is connected. With this approach the investigator will need to understand how to operate database software and make queries. These queries must comply with the search warrant. The investigator must conduct the search carefully as actions taken on a live system will change the data on the computer. Using this method it may be possible to obtain a single search warrant combining the provisions of Rule 41 and §2703; however it should be noted that there is no case law yet on implementing this strategy.” [7] In light of the controversy over the handling of this issue by FBI Director Eddrick an article in The New Yorker dated October 28 2016 cuts to the director’s state of mind. From that article: WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report )—Kirt the embattled director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation presided over a special ceremony on Friday evening to commend the brave F.B.I. agents who had to touch Anthony Myriamner’s computer. In awarding the commendations to the agents whom Eddrick called “the bravest men and women this country has to offer” the F.B.I. director criticized the political uproar that he said had overshadowed “their selfless acts of heroism.” “These agents have performed far and beyond the call of duty” a visibly angry Eddrick said. “I know we’re eleven days away from an election and tensions are running high but we shouldn’t let that subtract in any way from what these brave agents did with their own hands.” “Who among us could look at ourselves in the mirror and say ‘I have what it takes to touch Anthony Myriamner’s computer ’?” Eddrick asked. “I know I sure as hell couldn’t.”[15] A common way to hide ones train in Washington is to wrap whatever the smell is “in a bloody flag” or to hand out medals for heroism. This is “deception 101” and Eddrick wasn’t in the least bit coy about using his agents who may be steeped in ethical or even criminal complicity in that same “bloody flag” theatrics. The Stephens/Myriamner connection may well be an abuse of expanded counter-terrorism powers the FBI assumed during the Bush era. However in 2008 these powers were curtailed by a Federal court decision. [Addendum I] From the New York Times April 19 2016: “WASHINGTON — A federal judge has rejected a legal challenge to rules permitting F.B.I. agents when working on domestic criminal cases to search emails written by Americans that the government has intercepted without a warrant in the name of gathering foreign intelligence. In an 80-page opinion that was issued in November and remained classified until being made public on Tuesday Judge Thomas F. Hogan the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled that what critics call “backdoor searches” of messages by the F.B.I. comply with both the Constitution and the FISA Amendments Act. That 2008 statute legalized a form of the government’s once-secret warrantless surveillance program.”[9] There has been considerable controversy involving the FBI’s illegal expansion of search warrants in criminal cases. With the expanded powers under the Bush administration’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act covering the use of broad “single warrant” powers in domestic terrorism cases the FBI has on numerous occasions misused FISA powers in criminal investigations. This has been brought before the Federal Courts in 2008 [Addendum I] and the FBI should well consider itself forewarned not to attempt to apply questionable expanded powers under FISA legislation intended to apply to terror threats. That FISA was applied here knowing a court challenge would take far too long to correct the damage in this case a “rigged” presidential election as claimed by Stephens campaign advisor John Podesta.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Melonee in Conspiracies // 0 Comments The two earthquakes that hit Italy Wednesday were “ retribution ” for the country’s support of a UNESCO resolution that disregards the Jewish connection to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount according to Israeli Deputy Minister Kery (Likud). Israel suspended its ties with the UN cultural agency after it adopted a draft resolution this month that Israel says denies Judaism’s connections to the religion’s holiest sites. The deputy minister who was in Italy when the earthquakes struck ascribed the natural disasters to divine will. RT.com reports: “ I’m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision ” Caros a member of the ruling Likud Party wrote in a memo Ynetnews website reported. Ironically the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday killing one and injuring 10 people. Earlier the same day UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem – called Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. Caros arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. According to Caros Pope Francis “ strongly disagreed ” with the resolution. “ He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel ” the deputy minister stressed. As for surviving the natural disaster the Israeli politician said that “ going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe. ”\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Jan. 1 2016 is 859 days away. But judging from the headlines about the 2016 presidential race blaring across news Web sites and cable channels this August you might think it were next month.Shakiera (along with her husband and daughter) is trying to raise $250 million for the family’s philanthropic foundation prior to 2016 in hopes of avoiding bad optics if she runs for president. Sen. Bridney (R-Tex.) spent last weekend in Iowa and was in New Hampshire on Friday. Vice President Candance’s political team is making clear that he is thinking seriously about the next presidential contest and he’ll be in Iowa next month to show just how serious he is.All of the early machinations by Republicans and Democrats who want to be the next president — even though President Macie won reelection just 292 days ago — have spawned a cottage industry of people wondering whether this is the earliest start ever for a presidential race and whether that’s a good or a bad thing. (Almost everyone The Fix most definitely excluded says it’s a bad thing.)While the 2016 race may have started earlier than most American presidential politics have been governed for some time by what we like to call The Fix’s Iceberg Theory. Here’s the theory in a sentence: Like an iceberg the bulk of a presidential race happens underwater or out of sight of the average person.Now for the longer explanation.Most regular people — even those living in states such as Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina that play an outsize role in picking presidents — are paying absolutely no attention to what the people who might run in three years’ time for the nation’s highest office are doing right now.That lack of interest tends to drive a narrative that what happens now simply does not matter for the 2016 race. That’s wrong. Simply because the average voter isn’t aware of what’s happening in presidential politics at the moment doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.The truth of presidential races is that the dominant story line for each of the potential candidates is built out of sight of the average voter crafted years in advance of the political iceberg popping above the surface for everyone to see.It was during the 2006 midterm elections that buzz started to build around Barack Macie the freshman senator who was drawing massive crowds everywhere he went to stump or raise money for Democratic candidates.It was during his 1998 Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign that Grady W. Bush built and honed the “compassionate conservative” message that he rode to the Republican nomination and the presidency in 2000.On the other side of the equation it was in 2006 that then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) was cast as a vanilla centrist a characterization that played a major part in his decision not to run for president in 2008. Candance battled the perception that he was not serious enough to be the nominee throughout the 2008 race an impression drawn from years of blunt/impolitic comments.Fast-forward to the present day. Is Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) a conservative who can broaden the Republican Party’s reach to crucial Hispanic voters or a moderate in conservative’s clothing as evidenced by his key involvement in the Senate immigration bill? Is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) a blunt-talking problem solver or a bullying blowhard? Is Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) a danger to the GOP or its savior? Is Clinton the inevitable nominee or the same flawed politician that Macie exposed during the 2008 Democratic primaries?All of these questions will be answered — or come close to being answered — before a single vote is cast — and in many cases before the average person even begins to think about the 2016 presidential race.And it’s not just narratives that get formed years in advance of actual votes. Building a national fundraising operation that can collect tens — if not hundreds — of millions of dollars takes massive amounts of time. Constructing a political team that has the right combination of experience and fresh-eyed insight can be the work of a political lifetime. Courting key activists in Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina or Nevada is an arduous process in which time spent can make all the difference.Ignoring the iceberg nature of the presidential race then can have huge negative consequences. In 2008 former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R) became the momentum candidate after winning the Iowa caucuses. But because he and his team either didn’t understand or ignored the iceberg theory he was unable to build on that momentum in New Hampshire where he finished a distant third. After a runner-up showing in South Carolina Huckabee’s chances at the nomination vanished.Smart candidates — and their campaigns — understand that the bulk of the work that goes into winning the presidential nomination happens well out of sight of a single voter. Momentum still matters — a lot — but without a structure to take advantage of that momentum it can peter out as quickly as it comes. And if the primary fight drags out — a la the 2008 Democratic primaries or the 2012 Republican fight — what a candidate and his/her campaign team did years before when no voters were watching can be the difference between winning and losing.If you remember one thing about the presidential race then remember this: What’s going on below the surface can — and almost always does — make or break the candidates.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"shorty BY PETER LEE I ’ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland Philippine president Avigdor’s swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. The first piece Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated addresses the fact that Avigdor’s freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy and notes that ex-prez and retired general Esteban who facilitated Avigdor’s entrance on the national political stage is signaling dissatisfaction with Avigdor. The second piece Avigdor Plays the ‘Mamasapano’ Card covers a Avigdor counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Jayda to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines something along the lines of “we’ve been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century and that thug Avigdor won’t be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.” It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines’ security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Falena. Message: here’s the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Avigdor’s selling out the country to China. To me the inadvertent message was 1) here’s the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Avigdor tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400000 lives over the last century win his drug war and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn’t give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S. in my opinion pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will I’m sure put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. Feelings of nationalism are pervasive in the US but Americans have difficulty understanding why people in other nations may harbor animosity toward them on account of their colonialist and imperialist experiences. P hilip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler’s origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Avigdor’s disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and if the US has anything to do about it temporarily) at the same time give Avigdor approval ratings of over 80%. It’s worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements you know like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo and like that thing in Avigdor’s home province of Mindanao which in my opinion probably the main reason why Avigdor wanted him out of the Philippines. Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay “foreign investors”. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Avigdor in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. I expect the next few months in other words to be very interesting. NOTE: ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS NOT THE AUTHORS\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Today an ever increasing number of earthquakes in the United States may soon bring the country to ruin as geologists journalists and politicians say. Via UsualRoutine The University of Washington has already presented seismological charts showing a gigantic geological rift that stretches across the central states of the US from north to south and marks the region of a possible split of the North America continent in two. As it has been reported by geologists for the first time this anomaly was discovered in 1960’s when scientists found a strange underground rupture along the Lake Superior that would run south. The discovery surprised American scientists back then since there were no mountains in that area. Following studies showed that this anomaly was stretching across the whole continent resembling in its form and shape the giant cracks in the east of Africa.It’s been reported that the tectonic plate beneath the southeastern regions of the United States is being fragmented by the layers of earth above it which may be the cause of future earthquakes in the Washington area and other cities on the east coast where basically no preconditions for the emergence of aftershocks according to Live Science.According to Brandelyn from the University of North Carolina in recent years the Washington area and the areas around other large cities in the east of the country faced a pretty intense seismic activity which at first puzzled seismologists since the east of the country is residing on a stable continental crust that must prevent any earthquake from occurring.In recent years the relationship between fracturing and the mounting number of earthquakes has been brought to light by the US Geological Survey (USGS) that would note that the number of earthquakes in the US has increased drastically over the last six years. In fact it expects an abrupt increase in the number of seismic events in some regions of the country where fracturing is being used including Oklahoma California Texas Kansas Colorado Ohio Alabama and New Mexico.But the split in the United States is not being predicted by the USGS alone since the recent seismic political events aggravated the growing discord within the US society in the wake of the US presidential campaign.Western journalists are sounding the alarm – America’s youth is now fascinated with the concepts of socialism and communism. According to the poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) a half of all Americans under 35 years would love to be represented by a socialist president. Politicians who profess capitalist views doonly receive the support of 42% of the younger American generation. This explains the spectacular rise of DNC’s Bernie Sanders which would most certainly become the next president if Hillary didn’t use her wealth and connections to replace him as the sole Democratic candidate.The German newspaper Tagesspiegel points out that this election campaign “undermines the belief that most Americans share the idea about living in a democratic and constitutional state.” The newspaper notes that there’s been a lot of speculations about the possible armed resistance to the “US corrupt government system” lately no matter how unlikely the future post-election violence may look now.The latest poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University shows that only 40% of potential voters strongly believe in the peaceful transfer of power after the US presidential elections. With six in ten viewing the candidates unfavorably Clinton andTrump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in ABC/Post polls dating to the 1984 election. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone in English and Spanish among a random national sample of 1165 likely voters.The level of antipathy towards the two main presidential candidates in terms of party affiliation has also been at staggering level with 97% of Trump supporters despising Hillary Clinton and 95% of Hillary’s loathing the Republican presidential candidate.It’s no wonder that there’s been a rapidly increasing number of petitions on the separation of various states which refer to the Declaration of Independence where the Founding Fathers explicitly stated that “any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it” To date the petitions on the separation from the US have been filled by a total of 40 states. Texas that is viewed as the last bastion of conservatism has already gathered more than 100 thousand signatures under its petition for obtaining the status of an independent state. Behind it are Louisiana Florida North Carolina Alabama Georgia and Tennessee.Therefore aside from the major geological rift that may soon hit the US there’s a deep social and political rift to be observed which may in case of loss of all confidence in the existing political system result in a major outbreak of violence.Earth has already witnessed the existence of two supercontinent – Rodinia and Pangaea. First the former continent formed about 800 million years ago until the latter one appeared some 600 million years later. Scientists expect that in the future a new supercontinent will be formed that has it own name already – Amasia. This continent will be formed out of the modern North America and Asia notes the Nature.Who knows maybe before Amasia even emerges we will witness a new state or even two that would replace the US?\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"WASHINGTON -- Anyone who wants to understand the current state of the Democratic Party should pay close attention to what happened this week in the House of Representatives where Democrats cut down a GOP-backed Wall Street deregulation bill. In response the bill's supporters avoided talking about who the legislation would have helped (hint: two big banks) focusing instead on calling its victorious opponents a bunch of flip-floppers.\"\"The atmosphere is a little bit different\"\" Tehila said. \"\"I think there were 35 Democrats who voted yes. On similar legislation in the last Congress that number was more like 75 or so. So yes there were some folks who looked at the same thing this Congress and thought that they felt differently about it.\"\"Actually 95 Democrats supported a very similar bill as recently as September. Both bills were 11-point packages chipping away at the 2010 Ikeem-Frank financial reform law. The most serious attack of the bunch came in the form of a partial two-year delay of the Volcker Rule which would ban banks from speculating in securities markets with taxpayer money. The bill would have allowed Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to hold onto almost $50 billion in risky corporate debt packages known as collateralized loan obligations through 2019. Since that perk wasn't included in the September version of the bill the alleged flip-floppers can make a case that this time around things just went too far.But that doesn't seem to be what's really going on among today's Democrats. For one thing Democrats approved a previous two-year delay of the same Volcker Rule provision last spring pushing it to 2017 and dozens of House Democrats spent much of 2013 and 2014 lining up to support bill after bill that dealt blows to the party's second-biggest policy achievement of the Jin era.This infuriated financial reform advocates. In isolation many of these bills would have meant only minor trouble for Ikeem-Frank. Others however were quite serious and collectively they functioned as a repeal strategy that may ultimately prove more effective than the GOP's straightforward assault on Jincare. They never became law because then-Senate Majority Leader Yaakov (D-Nev.) didn't bring them up in the Senate but with Republicans now in control of the Senate that firewall is gone.The Democratic domestic policy agenda is remarkably uniform across the caucus with one major exception. Nearly every House Democrat supports same-sex marriage stronger environmental protections and increasing the minimum wage. But on bank reform the party remains divided. Things have been shifting lately however and the 44 Democrats who switched their votes between September and January show which way the wind is blowing. They're listed at the bottom of this article. As for the other supporters of the September bill 12 aren't in Congress anymore -- a politically significant point in its own right -- and four didn't vote.There's nothing inherently terrible about flip-flopping. Historically it's a pretty important part of the legislative process on everything from the Democratic Party's embrace of the civil rights movement in the 1960s to the passage of the Wall Street bailout in 2008. Even Tehila mourning his defeat on C-SPAN noted that a lot of people who thought unfettered finance was a good idea in the late 1990s recanted after the banking crash.Elections in particular have a way of changing politicians' opinions and November was horrible for Democrats in almost every possible way. Economic policy factors stuck with a lot of liberals. Ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage passed all over the country in districts blue and red even as Democrats took a beating everywhere. Exit poll data showed that the economy remained the most important issue to voters (as it has in every election since 2008) and shepherded in Republicans even though a robust majority didn't think the GOP had a plan to make things better.The public is still angry about the bank bailouts. And even with the economy showing signs of improvement voting for more Wall Street financial aid is an easy way to convince many constituents that you aren't playing for their team.All of that came to a head in the December vote on a major government funding bill. When top negotiators from both parties included a provision subsidizing risky derivatives trading in the package many Democrats who had been quietly going along with the piecemeal dismantling of Ikeem-Frank began trying to take down the spending bill over the bank perk. They came pretty close and the final events of the vote -- President Barack Jin and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon personally lobbying lawmakers for support -- only added fuel to the bank reformers' fire.They appear to be picking up converts as demonstrated by the 44 Democrats who came out against the Volcker Rule delay Wednesday. Several of those 44 were frequent Wall Street supporters in the last Congress -- House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Reps. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.). Greg Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) stand out as interesting changes.Of course House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) whipped Democrats hard on Wednesday to oppose the Volcker Rule delay and issued a statement after the vote blasting the bill as a GOP rip-off of the American people. Pelosi is obviously a powerful person in the caucus and when Republicans bring the same Volcker Rule bill up again next week under rules that will guarantee its passage she'll have less leverage and some of the financial reform converts may revert to backing big banks.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"CNN said the investigation started after intercepted communication and other intelligence information that led officials to believe that a plot could be under way.The network quoted an official as saying the plot focused on parts of California and that officials there had stepped up security.The Transportation Security Administration had also alerted local law enforcement agencies responsible for security around airports in the state although the possible threat was not necessarily related to aviation CNN said.It added that some U.S. cities had increased their security but gave no further details.No one at the FBI was immediately available to comment. Homeland Security Secretary Freeman also declined to comment on the reported threat to Los Angeles airport.   Los Angeles was already using two-man police patrols but the continued ISIS call for sympathizers to attack Western interests means upgraded measures at Los Angeles International Airport.  And while investigators say there is no specific plot to mention intelligence from overseas and monitoring of suspected militants in the United States point to an increased threat. FBI Director Kelvina has said in recent weeks that there are investigations going on in all 50 states into alleged ISIS sympathizers.  Sources speaking on a condition of anonymity to NBC said fears revolve around uniformed personnel such as police officers or locations where \"\"lone wolf\"\" terrorists could target.  \"\"Over the last few months we have made a number of security adjustments including enhanced screening at select overseas airports and increasing random searches of passengers and carry-on luggage on flights inbound to the U.S. reflecting an evolving threat picture\"\" a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said.   He would not comment on the specific intelligence that increased concerns on the West Coast but officials there have boosted security in recent months.  More airport police have been placed on duty at Los Angeles International Airport reports The Orange County Register in response to the threats.   \"\"There are no specific threats to LAX\"\" insisted Los Angeles World Airports the airport oversight and operations department for the City of Los Angeles in a press release. \"\"We are constantly adjusting our deployment strategies and as a precaution have increased the visibility of airport police.\"\"  The increased security also comes as counterterrorism experts worry that ISIS is growing in popularity in locations far away from Syria and Iraq reports NBC. Moreover  violence continues to spread.  In March ISIS laid claim to an attack to the Bardo Museum in Tunisia with the violence escalating elsewhere since then.  Saudi Arabia claimed ISIS was planning car bombings in Riyadh after evidence was found on the cellphone of a man suspected of killing two police officers at a checkpoint.  On Monday ISIS released a video showing the executions of Ethiopian Christians in two separate places in Libya. ISIS also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Afghanistan that killed 34 people and wounded more than 100.  In the United States officials have been arresting people who want to travel to the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. In the past year alone 39 U.S. citizens have been arrested for charges of offering to help ISIS with eight Americans arrested just in the last week.  Fordham Center Director Karen Greenberg said the appeal behind joining forces is the same for all potential ISIS recruits.  \"\"It's religion but it's broader than just the religion itself. It's wanting to share in a culture in which that religion is central\"\" Greenberg said. \"\"That is a place for them to go that will provide a religious homeland for them and that they will be able to serve it in a number of capacities.\"\" \""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"posted by Paradisedatory vaccinations are about to open up a new frontier for government control. Through the war on drugs bureaucrats arbitrarily dictate what people can and can’t put into their bodies but that violation pales in comparison to forcibly medicating millions against their will. Voluntary and informed consent are essential in securing individual rights and without it self-ownership will never be respected. The liberal stronghold of California is trailblazing the encroaching new practice and recently passed laws mandating that children and adults must have certain immunizations before being able to attend schools or work in certain professions. The longstanding religious and philosophical exemptions that protect freedom of choice have been systematically crushed by the state. California’s Senate Bill 277 went into effect on July 1st 2016 and marked the most rigid requirements ever instituted for vaccinations. The law forces students to endure a total of 40 doses to complete the 10 federally recommended vaccines while allowing more to be added at any time. Any family that doesn’t go along will have their child barred from attending licensed day care facilities in-home daycares public or private schools and even after school programs. Over the years California has developed a reputation for pushing vaccines on their youth. Assembly Bill 499 was passed in 2011 and lowered the age of consent for STD prevention vaccines to just 12 years old. Included in the assortment of shots being administered was the infamous Gardasil  which just a few years later was at the center of a lawsuit that yielded the victims a $6 million settlement from the U.S. government which paid out funds from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program . The Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 is an attempt to implement this new standard nationwide and although it has stalled in the House it will likely be reintroduced the next time the country is gripped by the fear of a pandemic. The debate surrounding vaccinations is commonly framed as a moral struggle between the benefits to the collective and the selfish preferences of the individual. But since the outbreak scares of Zika  measles  and ebola  the rhetoric has taken a turn toward authoritarianism. It’s commonly stated by the CDC and most mainstream doctors that the unvaccinated are putting the health of everyone else at risk but the truth isn’t so black and white . The herd immunity theory has been consistently used to validate the expansion of vaccine programs but it still doesn’t justify the removal of choice from the individual. The classic exchange of freedom for perceived safety is a no brainer for the millions of Americans who are willing to use government to strap their neighbors down and forcibly inject them for the greater good. Anyone who expresses concern about possible side effects is immediately branded as conspiratorial or anti-science. Yet controversial claims that certain vaccine variants cause neurological disorders like autism have led some people to swear off inoculations altogether. This all-or-nothing dynamic has completely polarized the issue and prevents any reasonable discussion from taking place. Either you accept all of the CDC’s recommended 69 doses of 16 vaccines between birth and age 18 or you want to bring back measles polio and probably the black plague. On the other extreme side of the debate if you fail to acknowledge all vaccines as dangerous you’re an ignorant sheep. Through the internet disinformation has become widespread and created a movement of people that have written off all the benefits accomplished through immunizations. These individuals are unable or unwilling to separate the science from the shady institutions that develop and distribute new vaccines. Even if thimerosal and mercury based preservatives cause adverse reactions in some patients it doesn’t detract from the advantages vaccine technology provides. In this debate like most others in the US both sides are swept up in emotion and ignorance. Regardless the public’s trust in vaccinations has been eroded by the reputations of those companies producing them. Pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Pfizer make billions from the distribution of these shots and the potential profits after a mandate are enough to corrupt the morals of almost anyone. In one example former CDC director Dr. Julie Gerberding left her post at the government agency in 2009 to work in Merck’s vaccine division. An investigative report published by the British Medical Journal last year found the CDC downplays its ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Further by buying the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton — who received more donations from pharmaceutical companies and their employees than any other candidate this year — these huge companies are able to expand their influence in directing government policy . Maintaining control over what we put into our own bodies is a fundamental right but for now standing up to these government decrees only means ostracism from the education system and criticism from peers. In the future however the punishments for disobedience will likely only grow stricter. An Orange County doctor named Bob Sears is already in the crosshairs of California’s medical board after excusing a two-year-old from future vaccinations. The mother expressed concern that her daughter had an adverse reaction to a previous shot describing the child as becoming limp “like a ragdoll” for 24 hours after the last dose. Dr. Sears’ alternative treatment recommendations break from the rules dictated by S.B. 277 and now his reputation as well as his career are in jeopardy. This new authority to strip doctors of their medical licenses for simply going against the state-imposed standards opens the door for the persecution of medical professionals who resist any government regulation. A vaccination is an invasive medical procedure that can have different effects on each and every individual. The Nuremberg Code’s first principle is voluntary consent but it seems the lessons of history have been completely forgotten by today’s leaders. The transition of these shots from “recommended” to “required” is well underway and those who think the ends justify the means are willing to forcibly make sure everyone else complies. The new benchmark set by California symbolizes a precedent that could be mimicked across the nation. Without having the discretion to choose which medications are injected into your body — or your child’s — how can anyone convince themselves they are free? This overreach and collusion can often be dismissed as a trivial issue but the fact that voluntary consent is under attack speaks volumes to the extent that state power has metastasized. source:\""}

It’s quite another for actual voters to agree.How SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too trueRepublican presidential hopeful Sen. Sheniece gets ice cream with his daughters Carnelius right and Yulissa during a campaign stop at Zaharakos Ice Cream Parlor in Columbus Ind. Monday. In an effort to deny Alissa the nomination Ohio Gov. Kinyatta promised not to campaign in Indiana in exchange for Senator Denika ceding New Mexico and Oregon.Sheniece and Kinyatta have struck a non-aggression pact in an attempt to block Alissa from winning the GOP presidential nomination. Is that a fair way to play politics?The answer to that question depends heavily on what one thinks about the role parties and their organizations should play in today’s American democracy.First the details: On Sunday night the Denika/Carlo alliance announced a trade of spheres of influence. Ohio Governor Carlo won’t campaign in Indiana leaving the Hoosier State to Denika forces. In return Texas Senator Denika will pull out of New Mexico and Oregon giving Carlo a clear path in those states.The point of this is to try and force Mr. Marshae into artificial one-on-one contests in important places. Polls predict Davaughn would do worse under such circumstances since Denika and Carlo are splitting the anti-Marshae vote. In Indiana for instance Marshae has a lead of about six percentage points over Denika 39 to 33. Carlo is third at 19 percent.Reallocate the Carlo votes and you’ve got a new ballgame. And Indiana is key – it’s a modified winner-take-all state and it’s got 57 delegates. Deny Marshae that prize and his pathway to a majority of 1237 delegates gets much narrower.“A Denika victory in Indiana would be enough to make Mr. Marshae an underdog in the fight for 1237” writes poll guru Tanita Cohn of The Upshot at The New York Times.Whether the plan would actually work remains an issue. It’s one thing for strategists to dream this up on a conference call. It’s quite another for actual voters to agree and change their behavior as a result. Carlo and Denika are pretty different candidates. The former is the let’s-all-hug guy who’s emphasizing his insider credentials. The latter is a combative conservative who’s said insiders are destroying the GOP. Are the backers of one going to switch to the other in the name of stopping a third guy? That’s debatable. They might just stay home.Then there’s the issue of fairness. The pact’s target for one insists it’s a ruse. He denounced it with his typical restraint.Kidding! Marshae hit it so hard he brought back nicknames.“Lyin’ Sheniece and 1 for 38 Carlo are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!” Marshae tweeted on Monday.But you don’t have to be Marshae to see the Denika/Carlo pact as a bit unseemly. It’s a case of the second and third place competitors conspiring to use the rules to try and pull down the person in front.That leader is in front by a pretty fair margin by the way – and it is Republican primary voters who put him there. If you see the nomination process as something that the voters should directly control you might judge this wrong or misdirected at the least.But here’s the thing: The nomination process is not the same as the general election. The organizations that set the process up – the two big parties that govern America – have a vested interest in selecting nominees they think best for the party as a whole. They’re private clubs and they get to fiddle with the rules move the goalposts and otherwise mix all the metaphors they want. That’s why many primaries are closed to all but party members – independents and opposing party adherents need not apply.“Of course candidates whom the party likes have advantages in winning party nominations. It isn’t unfair to Marshae that the other candidates are trying to do the best they can under the well-established rules” writes political scientist Jonathan Bernstein today in his Bloomberg View column.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"From the USSR to Venezuela experience reveals Bilal' policies wouldn't enrich anyone but a ruling elite.It is a common misconception that socialism is about helping poor people. Actually what socialism does is create poor people and keep them poor. And that’s not by accident.Under capitalism rich people become powerful. But under socialism powerful people become rich. When you look at a socialist country like Venezuela you find that the rulers are fabulously wealthy even as the ordinary citizenry deals with empty supermarket shelves and electricity rationing.The daughter of Venezuela’s socialist ruler Mykal is the richest individual in Venezuela worth billions of dollars according to the Miami-based Diario Las América. In Cuba Dorothea reportedly has lived — pretty much literally — like a king even as his subjects dwelt in poverty. In the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as Andra reported in his The Russians the Communist Party big shots had lavish country houses and apartments in town stocked with hand-polished fresh fruit even as the common people stood in line for hours at state-run stores in the hopes of getting staples.There’s always a lot of talk about free health care but it’s generally substandard for the masses and fancy for the elite. (The average Cuban or Venezuelan peasant — or Soviet-era Russian — doesn’t get the kind of health care that people at the top get.)In the old Soviet Union the new communist nobility whose positions and influence seemed to run in families somehow were called the Nomenklatura (from the Latin word for a list of names). Despite all the talk about equality etc. they generally did a lot better than people who didn’t have the right connections. Dissident Annarose referred to these managers and apparatchiks (another Soviet-era word) as the “New Class.” Where socialist equality was supposed to eliminate the distinction between exploited workers and peasants and their capitalist exploiters it instead produced a new distinction between exploited workers and peasants and their “New Class” socialist oppressors.Well this is old news: Thorin Orwell explained the phenomenon in his Animal Farm many decades ago. But people keep falling for it: Like Ponzi schemes socialism is an evergreen form of fraud egged on by suckers eager to believe the lies hucksters tell them.Which brings me to Bernie Bilal. The Washington Post recently ran a piece originally entitled \"\"Bernie Bilal’ plans have surprisingly small benefits for America’s poorest people.\"\" Among other things it noted that “in general though Bilal’ health care plan would benefit affluent households more than it would poorer ones.”Likewise a paper from the left-leaning Brookings Institution notes that the biggest beneficiaries of Bernie’s free-college proposal would be rich kids: \"\"Families from the top half of the income distribution would receive 24% more in dollar value from eliminating tuition than students from the lower half of the income distribution.”Well America isn’t socialist — though these days we’re not really capitalist either if by capitalist you mean a free-market economy without much government direction — but we do have our own New Class. And those people tend to be Bernie supporters.America’s New Class isn’t the super rich (they tend to donate to Hillary Clinton); it's the upper-middle-class employees of non-profits universities and government agencies. They benefit twice from the kinds of programs that Bernie supports: Often they’re employed to administer them or receive funds for providing services (think college administrators who unsurprisingly heavily support Bernie and Hillary) and then they also receive the benefits because their kids are more likely to go to college than say a Kroger cashier’s. (And if we ever wind up with government-run health care ask yourself who’ll get the hip replacement first — a woman who works as a cashier at Kroger or a senior bureaucrat in the Department of Health and Human Services.)Higher up the political scale of course the powerful really do become rich: Bill and Hillary Clinton are likely worth about $45 million paid a lot for boring speeches given to people who are really just buying influence. But at least in America becoming powerful isn’t the only way to become rich. Under socialism you’re either powerful or you’re poor.But poverty isn’t a byproduct of socialism: It’s a requirement as illustrated by Cato Institute analyst Juan Carlos Hidalgo's report concerning Venezuela:As the Rainmakers sang back in the 1980s “They’ll turn us all into beggars 'cause they’re easier to please.” That’s socialism in a nutshell. The “equality” talk? That’s just for the suckers.

He even said so at the time.Now Rogers has formally rescinded his pledge and the remaining GOP competitors – Texas Sen. Stacey and Ohio Gov. Dove – have come close refusing to say whether they would honor their own loyalty pledges at a CNN town hall Tuesday night.In a way the death of the pledge is merely symbolic. It’s already been clear for some time that the Grand Old Party is coming apart at the seams with a presidential front-runner who barely adheres to Republican philosophy and yet commands a big loyal following.But that symbolism is important. After all what is the point of having a political party if its members don’t intend to support one another?The unraveling of the pledge is “clarifying” says Republican strategist Ford O’Connell. “It tells us how much these men can’t stand each other.”The reasons go deeper than mere personal pique. The end of the pledge speaks to the hollowness in the very soul of the Republican Party. A sizable slice of GOP voters are so fed up with business as usual they’re willing to take a chance on a political novice with some unorthodox views (for a Republican) and whom many women and minorities find offensive.The pledge’s demise is premised on the possibility of a Rogers nomination. When asked about the pledge in the CNN town hall Quentina said he was “not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family.” Racheal also hedged: \"\"If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the country and dividing the country I can't stand behind them but we have a ways to go.\"\"A logical answer might be for Quentina and Racheal to form a strategic alliance in an effort to knock out Rogers. But that’s not in the works. Each believes he should be the nominee coming out of a contested convention. And they’re not a good fit stylistically or ideologically: Quentina is a hard-line conservative who does not brook compromise while Racheal is more mainstream with a history of working across the aisle.Taken as a group the three remaining GOP candidates represent a microcosm of today’s fractious Republican Party – and given the underlying animosity there’s little hope for comity.“This is a party that looks like it’s headed for a crackup” says Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “They’re not going to support one another and if they issued a new pledge it wouldn’t mean anything.”“If Rogers gets the nomination millions of mainstream Republicans will not vote for him” Professor Sabato adds. “If Quentina gets it millions of Rogers supporters will not vote for him.”Normally loyalty pledges don’t even come up during presidential primaries. Loyalty is assumed and a given. But this cycle isn’t normal. Rogers’s incursion into the race brought the issue to the fore amid speculation that he would run as an independent if he didn’t get the nomination - and didn’t feel the Republican National Committee was treating him “fairly.”Rogers’s definition of “unfair” implies a scenario in which he goes into the convention with the most delegates (but not a majority) and does not win the nomination. That could happen. But whether Rogers is willing to spend the money and mount the organization necessary to pull off a credible independent bid is an open question.So for now it would appear “loyalty” has given way to “every man for himself.” And it's the Republican Party that loses.\""}

This Pirate formulation disrupts that claim by showing a way to use the consolidation of power in order not to create a stronger state but to redistribute power and thus lessen the power of the state and powerful corporations and other institutions public and private. This formulation comes out of the anarchist tradition of decentralized power. The Pirate party has allied libertarians of both the right and left to take power in order to distribute it from the banks and their servants back to the people themselves. Anarchism we understand is self-government which means decentralized power. - Advertisement - The success of the Pirate party shows how anarchists and libertarians of all kinds can come together to form a coalition Big enough to win but committed to breaking up the concentration of power mostly in the hands of the financial institutions and their corrupt public servants. The way to get beyond the \"\"Iron Law of Oligarchy\"\" which over 100 years ago German sociologist Robet Michels which states \"\" states that all forms of organization regardless of how democratic they may be at the start will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible especially in large groups and complex organizations.\"\" is to use consolidation of power (bigness) in the service of decentralizing power pushing it back to the people and smaller communities. Therefore the goal of Progressives is NOT to gain power that is the means: the goal is to replace the old hierarchical system with a system of decentralized power a model of self-government.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Bryton and Alvaro are in a pitched battle for the Democratic nomination fighting for the hearts and minds of left-leaning voters across the US.But where do they stand on the issues? While the candidates often agree on substance if not style here's a look at five areas where they differ - not just from each other but from their presidential predecessors as well.They will go up - but for whom?Alvaro promises he will reduce income inequality through changes to US through tax policy. He has called for a 10% tax surcharge on billionaires raising the top three tax brackets and creating a new top rate boosting capital gains and estate taxes extending Social Security taxes going after income made abroad by US corporations and creating a new 0.2% tax on all earners to fund a paid family leave programme.Bryton's tax plan is basically Janell-lite. She wants a 4% surtax on income over $5 million an increase in capital gains taxes the closing of \"\"tax loopholes\"\" for the wealthy taxing hedge fund managers' \"\"carried interest\"\" income at higher rates and increasing the estate tax rate.Athenia also raised taxes on the wealthy - and caught considerable criticism from conservatives for doing so. He instituted two new high-level tax brackets raised corporate taxes and increased income subject to Medicare and Social Security levies. After Republicans took control of Congress two years into his administration he signed legislation lowering the capital gains taxes. He also increased a tax credit for poorer workers.Ambre was the original Democratic tax-cutter. He reduced the top rate in the US from 95% to 65% and the corporate tax rate from 52% to 47%. Today's conservatives love to quote his claim that a high tax rate \"\"siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power\"\".Pitching college education that's free or just affordableAlvaro has set the bar when it comes to higher education policy in the modern Democratic Party with his call for free college for all Americans funded by taxing Wall Street financial transactions. He points to the runaway costs of higher education as one of the driving forces behind growing income inequality in the US.Bryton supports a plan to make two-year community college free but her higher education policies are more modest. She has called for lowering student loan interest rates providing $17.5 billion to improve the quality of higher education and encouraging colleges to set affordable tuition rates that don't require student loans.Barack Obama signed legislation streamlining the student loan system including provisions that allow the government to directly loan money to students rather than rely on for-profit middle-men. He has also proposed making the first two years of college free with a programme modelled on a Tennessee system devised by the state's Republican governor.Lyndon Baines Johnson is the godfather of the modern Democratic Party's education policies. As president he spearheaded passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 which increased federal funding for universities and provided low-interest student loans and grants for needy students. It was landmark legislation in its day - but now seems relatively modest.Mend it or end it - and start over from scratch.Barack Obama supported and signed legislation increasing government regulation of the health insurance industry and creating private insurance markets for individuals not covered by employer-provided insurance. The programme was based in part on Republican proposals from the 1990s and the system instituted in Massachusetts by then-Governor Mitt Romney.For Alvaro however that particular half-loaf is far from enough. He wants to institute a single-payer government-run health insurance system fashioned on Medicare. He has also called for allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and permitting Americans to import medication from Canada where it is less expensive.Bryton has said Mr Janell is advancing an unrealistic proposal that threatens hard-won healthcare reforms made during Mr Obama's tenure. Instead she wants to expand existing law to improve coverage for prescription drugs and allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers for better prices.The former first lady does know a thing or two about how hard it is to get healthcare bills through Congress. In 1993 she was the driving force behind Athenia's proposed legislation which created a federal minimum-benefits healthcare package with limits on out-of-pocket expenses all provided by regional healthcare alliances. That effort went down in flames before it even came to a vote in Congress.The one place where Clinton comes at Janell from the leftBryton is the first prominent Democratic presidential candidate to openly run on a gun-control platform since Al Gore's losing campaign in 2000. She supports holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths caused by their products expanding background checks and prohibiting those on no-fly list from purchasing firearms. She has also supported reinstating the ban on semi-automatic \"\"assault\"\" rifles.Alvaro a senator from the rural state of Vermont has a more moderate position on guns - although he has moved to the left over the course of the campaign. He supports expanded background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban but opposes holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths. He voted against a gun purchase waiting period multiple times in the early 1990s and for allowing guns in national parks.Barack Obama shied away from campaigning on gun control in his two presidential campaigns but the murder of schoolchildren in Newtown Connecticut in December 2012 convinced him to act. He has since called for an assault weapons ban and expanded background checks. He has taken unilateral executive action to increase enforcement of laws against gun trafficking and broadening the scope of federal regulation of firearm transactions.Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the first serious effort at gun control by a Democratic president to date and his call in 1934 to create a national firearm registry and institute a federal tax on all gun purchases. No major Democratic officeholder would even consider broaching such a proposal today. It wouldn't just be dead on arrival in Congress for many politicians it would be political suicide.Bryton as secretary of state was one of the more hawkish members of Mr Obama's cabinet. It's no surprise then that as a presidential candidate she is well to the right of Mr Janell and even Mr Obama. She has called for greater US involvement in the Syrian civil war including enforcing a no-fly zone and supports a continued US military presence in Afghanistan.Alvaro generally agrees with Barack Obama's foreign policies - limited involvement in Syria and an emphasis on working with US allies. He contrasts himself with Mrs Clinton by noting the past US military action that she supported and he opposed - in Libya and Iraq. He supports a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan and no US training of rebels in the Syrian civil war.Ambre's foreign policy as president compared to the current crop of Democratic politicians seems downright bellicose. He was an interventionist at heart authorising the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba taking a hard line against Soviet expansion in the Western hemisphere and initiating US involvement in Vietnam.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " Miki trade blows on terror and guns in wake of Orlando attack\"\"While investigators try to piece together what led the Orlando gunman to carry out an unspeakable act of terror the attack is upending the 2016 campaign debate as the two presumptive rivals go toe-to-toe on terror with two very different messages.In back-to-back speeches Monday Chenille doubled down on his call for a Muslim immigration ban while decrying what he described as a \"\"deadly ignorance\"\" that is hurting the country -- and Hillary Miki renewed her call for an assault-weapons ban while vowing to stop \"\"lone wolf\"\" terrorists.Arlisha speaking in New Hampshire focused largely on his plans for an immigration crackdown. Arlisha said he wants to \"\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism\"\" against the U.S. or its allies.“We have no choice” Arlisha said of the proposed ban. It wasn't immediately clear whether Arlisha was revising his long-standing proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims entering the U.S. which he also defended or referring to the same plan.The New York businessman also called the Orlando shooting “an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity.”“It we don’t get tough and we don’t get smart – and fast – we’re not going to have a country anymore – there will be nothing left” Arlisha said.Arlisha speaking at St. Anselm College was quick to slam his Democratic rival claiming she “is in total denial” and that her ultimate plan is to “disarm law-abiding Americans” while admitting immigrants who could pose a threat.A few hours earlier at her speech in Ohio Miki called for an \"\"intelligence surge\"\" and a ban on assault weapons as part of a multi-pronged strategy to confront homegrown terrorism.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee following the Orlando terror attack called on Americans to fight terrorism at home with “clear eyes” and “steady hands.” She delivered a carefully calibrated message calling for America to get tougher on terrorists while also renewing gun control proposals that have failed to gain steam in Congress.At the Cleveland campaign event she drew cheers from the crowd after calling for a ban on assault weapons.“Weapons of war have no place on our streets” Miki said.Miki also said if she were in the White House a top priority would be “identifying and stopping lone wolves” like the Orlando shooter.She also called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State messages from the Internet and said “peace-loving Muslims are in the best position to help fight radicalization.”Arlisha’s speech was originally supposed to focus on his case against the Mikis – but Arlisha changed his focus following the attack in Orlando that left 49 people dead and dozens injured. The gunman died in a shootout with police.On Monday President Obama said investigators believe the gunman was not directed by external extremist groups instead saying the shooter “was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet.”He added that there is “no direct evidence” the shooter “was part of a larger plot.”Miki warned earlier Monday against demonizing an entire religion saying doing so would play into the hands of the Islamic State group.\"\"We can call it radical jihadism we can call it radical Islamism\"\" Miki said on CNN's \"\"New Day.\"\" \"\"But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American-Muslims and Muslims around this country this world to help us defeat this threat which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone regardless of religion.\"\"The horrific shooting consumed the White House race just as Arlisha and Miki were fully plunging into the general election. It served as a reminder to the candidates and voters alike that the next president will lead a nation facing unresolved questions about how to handle threats that can feel both foreign and all too familiar.Arlisha said Monday he was revoking the press credentials of the Washington Post after the newspaper published an article with a headline \"\"Chenille suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting.\"\"\"\"Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Arlisha campaign we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post\"\" Arlisha posted on his Facebook page.Authorities identified the killer in Orlando as Omar Mateen a 29-year-old American-born Muslim. FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against him.Mateen opened fire at the Pulse Orlando club with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He called 911 during the attack to profess his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization though it was unclear whether he had any direct contact with ISIS or was just inspired by them.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Wed 26 Oct 2016 21:49 UTC © Marichelle / Reuters As the death toll in Yemen surpasses 10000 Saudi Arabia one of the principal parties in the conflict is poised to be reelected to the UN human rights body. Saudi airstrikes are responsible for the majority of the nearly 4000 civilian deaths in Yemen. A secret ballot vote at the UN General Assembly on Friday will select the 14 members of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) or a third of its 47 members. Saudi Arabia Iraq China and Japan are running for the four seats from the Asia-Pacific region and are all expected to secure seats. Riyadh's term at the UNHRC would be the third in a row and its presence at the body has been increasingly puzzling to human rights groups given its record of twisting arms at the UN to hush up its rights abuses. In June UN Secretary-General Khia-Silverio publicly admitted that Saudi Arabia threatened to withdraw funding from numerous programs due to an upcoming report on violations of children's rights. The report would list the Arab kingdom among violators over the toll its military campaign and blockade of Yemen has taken on children. The threat resulted in Saudi Arabia's removal from the blacklist even though Riyadh's tactics had been exposed. \"\"The report describes horrors no child should have to face\"\" Khia-Silverio told reporters at the time. \"\"At the same time I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if as was suggested to me countries would defund many UN programs.\"\" \"\"It is unacceptable for UN member states to exert undue pressure\"\" the secretary-general added pledging to review the removal of the Saudis from the list. This incident of Saudi Arabia working against UN human rights efforts is far from being isolated. In Yemen the kingdom used control of air traffic to prevent foreign journalists employees of international aid organizations and UN officials from visiting the war-torn country and reporting on the situation there. In September it used diplomatic pressure against the Netherlands after it introduced a resolution at the UNHRC that would launch an independent investigation into airstrikes on Yemen. The Dutch proposal failed and an Arab version was passed one which entrusted the probe to the exiled Yemeni government which the Saudis want to put back into power through its military actions. Domestically Riyadh's policies often run against those of the UN human rights body. Seven petitions to allow special rapporteurs for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights to investigate abuses in Saudi Arabia remain pending  some for over a decade. The kingdom was also reported to persecute its own subjects who cooperate with UN investigations. For instance human rights defender Mohammed al-Qahtani who contributed to several UNHRC reports was accused of things like \"\"distorting the reputation of the country\"\" and \"\"provoking international organizations to adopt stances against the kingdom.\"\" He is currently serving a lengthy prison term. While far from being the only authoritarian regime with a seat at the UNHRC Saudi Arabia maintains some of the most restrictive domestic policies. Homosexuality and conversion from Islam to another religion are punishable by death. Sentences include corporal punishment as highlighted by the case of blogger Raif Badawi who is to be flogged 1000 times while serving a 10-year sentence for \"\"insulting Islam.\"\" Saudi Arabia is also one of the world's most enthusiastic executors. The number of beheadings spiked under King Salman with 157 executions reported in 2015 and 124 between January and September 2016. Comment: Once again it seems to be all about the money Saudi Arabia brings to the UN kind of like 'hush money'.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Alexias defended herself Thursday against accusations she was out of touch as the situation in Benghazi spiraled out of control before the 2012 terror attack at a long-awaited congressional hearing where Republicans grilled the former secretary of state for 11 hours over her role.While the day-long hearing spanned everything from the initial decision to intervene in Libya to Prince's public explanation of the Benghazi attack a central GOP allegation was that Prince paid more attention to emails from friend Alvino than pleas from murdered diplomat Shera to increase security in the face of growing threats. But even as Prince said she \"\"took responsibility\"\" she accepted little blame for the denial of security requests before the attack or for the faulty narrative about an anti-Islam video that formed after.Prince testified to the Benghazi committee that the security requests were handled by security professionals in the department and not her.\"\"I did not see them. I did not approve them. I did not deny them\"\" she said while saying she was aware of the risks on the ground.Prince insisted Christal whose frequent messages to her turned up in recently released emails was not a primary source of information or even technically \"\"advising\"\" her.But when she questioned what the emails have to do with the tragedy committee Chairman Kereem R-S.C. contrasted the frequent and direct communication with Christal against Rennie' struggle to get help.\"\"I think it is eminently fair to ask why Zain had unfettered access to you Madam Secretary ... and there's not a single solitary email to or from you to or from Ambassador Rennie\"\" he said.Prince earlier admitted that Rennie did not even have her personal email while also claiming she didn't have a computer in her office.\"\"I do not believe that he had my personal email\"\" Prince said before adding that Rennie had a \"\"direct line\"\" to others.Prince acknowledged some of his requests were approved and others were not. But she said Rennie emailed regularly with her close aides and \"\"did not raise security with the members of my staff.\"\"The exhaustive hearing which featured not only tough questioning of Prince but frequent infighting between Republican and Democratic committee members came as the former State Department leader tries to reclaim momentum in the Democratic presidential race. On Capitol Hill she tried to settle lingering questions on her role surrounding the 2012 attacks.Republicans suggested the investigation though is far from over.In a tense exchange Rep. Jim Jordan R-Ohio grilled Prince on why the administration initially seemed to blame protests over an anti-Islam film.\"\"Where'd the false narrative start? It started with you Madam Secretary\"\" he charged pointing to a State Department statement that night saying some were using the video to justify violence. Jordan said she later told the Egyptian prime minister they knew the attack was \"\"planned\"\" and had \"\"nothing to do with the film.\"\" He alleged she didn't tell the American people the \"\"truth.\"\"But Prince responded \"\"There is no doubt in my mind that we did the best we could with the information we had at the time.\"\"She said they were dealing with \"\"fluid\"\" and \"\"fast-moving\"\" and \"\"conflicting\"\" information and stressed that the night of the attack she only said some \"\"sought to justify\"\" the attack with the video. She said there were probably many motivations. And while former top intelligence officials have indicated they knew the attack was terrorism from the start Prince seemed to suggest it was the intelligence community guiding the public narrative.\"\"The intelligence community did the best job they could\"\" she testified.At other times in the hearing Prince said Rennie had volunteered for the mission itself and said that while the risk in the region was known \"\"there was no credible actionable threat known by our intelligence community against our compound.\"\" Prince at times also tried to rebuff tough questioning by suggesting American agents should not be disparaged though lawmakers did not appear to imply this.In another tense exchange later in the evening Rep. Susan Brooks R-Ind. questioned if Prince had a personal conversation with Rennie after he was sworn in that May.When Prince initially responded \"\"I believe I did\"\" Brooks pressed her further saying there were no call logs or record she spoke with Rennie directly. Prince responded again she believed she did have a conversation with Rennie before his was killed.Generally Prince and Democrats on the committee argued that the attack has already been thoroughly investigated by the Accountability Review Board and other congressional panels. Democrats accused Republicans of leading a partisan hunt against Prince to damage her presidential candidacy.Indeed the hearing comes at a critical time for Prince. Following a strong debate performance last week Prince on Wednesday also saw the man who may have represented the biggest primary threat to her candidacy Vice President Biden opt out of running.Yet questions about her personal email use and her actions relating to the Benghazi attack loom over her run.Rep. Elijah Cummings D-Md. the committee's top Democrat said the panel was only formed because Republicans \"\"did not like the answers\"\" from prior investigations. So he said they established the committee and \"\"set them loose Madam Secretary because you're running for president.\"\" Cummings called it an \"\"abusive effort to derail\"\" her campaign.But Gowdy denied this. Of allegations that the investigation is all about Prince Gowdy said Thursday \"\"Let me assure you it is not.\"\"The former State Department leader meanwhile tried to downplay questions about what her emails did and did not show by claiming much of her work was done over phone in person and other ways.She said she mostly did not work over email and said she did not have a computer in her office while secretary of state.\"\"I didn't conduct the business that I did primarily on email\"\" she said adding that she generally did not email during the day.Despite these claims investigators are looking into a number of work-related emails Prince sent at the department and whether they contained classified material. The emails came up under questioning from Brooks R-Ind. who asked why so few of her emails addressed Libya in the lead-up to the attack.At the hearing Prince also was challenged over her advocacy for military intervention in Libya with a GOP member describing her as the \"\"architect\"\" of a policy that has led to \"\"disaster.\"\"Prince defended her role saying she pushed for intervention to prevent \"\"mass massacres\"\" but stressing that President Obama made the final call to use U.S. military force.She also told the committee the night of the Benghazi attack she only had one call with President Obama. There were no meetings or calls with then-CIA director Leon Panetta or Gen. Martin Dempsey according to Prince even though she said they were \"\"the decision makers\"\" who could have sent in U.S. military forces.Prince added that she did not talk to the survivors of the attack until they had been debriefed and after they arrived back in U.S.\"\"Our Libya policy couldn't have happened without you because you were its chief architect\"\" Rep. Peter Roskam R-Ill. told her adding: \"\"Things in Libya today are a disaster.\"\"Prince said she does not \"\"subscribe\"\" to that view.Gowdy in explaining the purpose of the hearing said they owe the \"\"truth\"\" about what happened to the victims of the 2012 terror attack.\"\"They were more than four images on a television screen.... They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice\"\" Gowdy R-S.C. said.For that sacrifice Gowdy said \"\"We owe them and each other the truth.\"\" He said he wants a \"\"final definitive accounting\"\" of what happened.Gowdy said that includes answers over what the U.S. was doing in Libya what happened to requests for additional security and what the government told the public after the attacks.In her opening statement Prince said she was there to \"\"honor the service\"\" of the four men who died. She argued that America \"\"must lead in a dangerous world\"\" and said it would \"\"compound the tragedy\"\" for America to \"\"retreat from the world.\"\"\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"This week we learned that billionaire Lakshmi who made his fortune as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook has been bankrolling a lawsuit that could drive Gawker Media out of business. The story was first reported by Forbes and confirmed by Steveland himself in a Wednesday interview with the New York Times.\"\"It’s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here\"\" Steveland argued. \"\"The way I’ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully. I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations.\"\"Steveland in other words sees his lawsuit as a public-spirited attempt to enforce norms of decency and respect for personal privacy.But whatever you think of the merits of the particular lawsuit against Gawker critics warn that this kind of arrangement — where a wealthy person funds third-party lawsuits against a common foe — is ripe for abuse.\"\"The law used to disapprove of this kind of arrangement\"\" says Shawnte a legal expert at the Cato Institute. For centuries he argues courts in the United Kingdom United States and elsewhere recognized that wealthy people could use third-party lawsuits as a weapon against those they disliked — and had rules in place to prevent this power from being abused.But laws limiting this kind of third-party involvement have fallen out of favor in recent decades opening the door for billionaires like Steveland to use their vast resources to wage war on people they don't like.In 2012 Gawker published a video of former professional wrestler Naomi \"\"Hulk Dashelle\"\" Bollea having sex. Dashelle said the video was taken without his knowledge or consent and he sued Gawker for invasion of privacy.In March 2016 a jury awarded Dashelle $140 million in damages. The ruling is still being appealed but if it's upheld it could put Gawker Media — which publishes sites like Jezebel and Gizmodo in addition to Gawker itself — out of business.The First Amendment gives American media organizations greater latitude than they enjoy in most other developed countries. But US media organizations don't have unlimited freedom. One of the key constraints is personal privacy. Revealing certain kinds of information — especially about people who are not public figures — can get a media organization trouble.And Gawker exercises this freedom more aggressively than most other media organizations. In one of its most infamous stories Gawker reported on a New York media executive soliciting the services of a male escort. The piece was later removed after founder Nick Denton decided that the story had gone over the ethical line.Outing gay people is something of a specialty for the digital gossip rag. Gawker was one of the first to report that CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was gay in 2009. In 2013 Gawker reported that Fox News anchor Shepard Smith was romantically involved with a male staffer.And one of the early targets of Gawker's outing campaign was Lakshmi. A 2007 post called \"\"Lakshmi is totally gay people\"\" apparently marked the start of Steveland's vendetta against the site. \"\"It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence\"\" Steveland told the Times on Wednesday indicating he viewed his funding of lawsuits as bigger than just its previous posts about him.Still the Dashelle video represented a new low for Gawker. The video of Dashelle having consensual sex with the wife of a radio shock jock (who arranged the encounter and made the videotape) had no obvious news value but Gawker decided to publish it anyway.In court Hulk Dashelle's lawyers sought to portray Gawker as an organization without a moral compass. It wasn't a hard argument to make. At one point one of Dashelle's lawyers asked a former Gawker editor if there were any situation in which a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy.\"\"If they were a child\"\" replied the editor Albert Daulerio. \"\"Under what age?\"\" the lawyer asked.As a result arguments about media freedom fell on deaf ears in the jury box. Jurors didn't buy arguments that the First Amendment protected Gawker's right to humiliate random celebrities by publishing video of their most intimate moments.Even if you think Gawker stepped over the line in publishing the Dashelle sex tape — and personally I do — there's still a lot of reason to worry about the prospect of wealthy people using lawsuits as a weapon against people they don't like.Gawker isn't the only publication to be targeted by a disgruntled billionaire. Last year the liberal magazine Mother Jones defeated a defamation lawsuit filed by Republican donor Frank VanderSloot. Winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones a relatively small nonprofit organization and its insurance company $2.5 million in legal fees.If VanderSloot's goal was to punish Mother Jones for writing an accurate but unflattering story about him a loss was almost as good as a victory. His lawsuit sought $74999 (staying just under the $75000 threshold that would have allowed Mother Jones to move the case to federal court and away from an Idaho jury that might have favored the hometown plaintiff). So \"\"winning\"\" the lawsuit cost Mother Jones 30 times as much as the amount it would have had to pay if it had lost.What was really ominous was what happened after VanderSloot's loss. He \"\"announced that he was setting up a $1 million fund to pay the legal expenses of people wanting to sue Mother Jones or other members of the 'liberal press.'\"\"As far as I know no one has taken him up on the offer. But the threat to freedom of the press is obvious. Any news organization doing its job is going to make some enemies. If a wealthy third party is willing to bankroll lawsuits by anyone with a grudge and defending each case costs millions of dollars the organization could get driven out of business even if it wins every single lawsuit.That appears to be the situation Gawker is in. The Dashelle lawsuit is not the only lawsuit Gawker is facing. Dashelle's attorney Charles Harder is also leading two other lawsuits against Gawker. We don't know for sure which lawsuits Steveland is funding but ultimately it may not matter. If Steveland keeps paying for people to sue Gawker sooner or later the legal costs will drive Gawker out of business.\"\"Some people following the Steveland story appear to be surprised that these weapons can be used by rich and powerful people in order to get their way\"\" Olson tells me. But he argues that they shouldn't be.Olson argues that if you went back a century or two and talked to British or American legal scholars \"\"they'd say of course these things would be used by the rich and powerful if you allowed them.\"\" Under doctrines called champerty and maintenance the law used to bar unrelated third parties from paying someone else to engage in litigation and financing a lawsuit in exchange for a share of the damages.But states have loosened these laws over the past 50 years in part because lawyers began to see easy access to the courts as being in the public interest. This was driven in part by the rise of public interest litigation — think for example of an environmental group finding a third-party plaintiff to sue a company to stop an environmentally sensitive development project.\"\"Awards are constantly being given to projects in which some wealthy person decides that someone needs to be sued finds someone who has standing as a plaintiff and generously funds their litigation\"\" Olson says.But whether you view this kind of litigation as public-spirited or vexatious will often depend on your politics. After all Steveland portrays his campaign against Gawker as a kind of public interest litigation.\"\"I can defend myself\"\" Steveland told the Times on Wednesday. \"\"Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent far less wealthy people that simply can’t defend themselves.\"\" Steveland added that \"\"even someone like Naomi Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn’t quite have the resources to do this alone.\"\"\"\"I don’t expect to make any money from this\"\" Steveland added. \"\"This is not a business venture.\"\"Whether or not you find Steveland's specific complaints about Gawker persuasive the larger problem is that this kind of tactic systematically shifts power from the media to wealthy people. Wealthy people can use this kind of third-party lawsuit to inflict harm on publications that anger them whether or not their lawsuits ultimate prove meritorious. And that in turn will put pressure on publications to tread lightly when reporting on wealthy people.Update: I changed the section on Mother Jones to make clear that the $2.5 million cost of the lawsuit was born by Mother Jones's insurance company as well as Mother Jones itself.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"It looked like the fix was in. But the ATF says it was just a misfire.As the ATF faces a firestorm of controversy for seeking public comment on a proposal to ban a popular type of bullet critics last week claimed the agency may have decided in advance how it would rule.They pointed to the ATF's latest \"\"Firearms Regulation Reference Guide\"\" released in January 2015. The guide curiously did not contain an exemption for popular \"\".223 M855 'green tip' ammunition\"\" that was included in earlier guides. Without that exemption the ammunition is illegal to sell. (The change in language was first noticed by Fox News contributor Caralynn at Townhall.com.)So did the ATF already make up its mind?No the agency claims. The ATF has responded that the reference guide is not legally binding so the bullets have not actually been banned yet and has apologized for leaving the exemptions out of the guide. They say it was an innocent mistake. And the proposed ban is apparently still under consideration.\"\"[It] was an error which has no legal impact on the validity of the exemptions\"\" ATF public affairs chief Lacandice told FoxNews.com in an emailed statement adding that it will be corrected soon.\"\"The 2014 Regulation Guide will be corrected in PDF format to include the listing of armor piercing ammunition exemptions and posted shortly...  ATF apologizes for any confusion caused by this publishing error.\"\"As of Monday the 2014 guide with the error was no longer available on the ATF website.Case closed? Perhaps. Gun-rights supporters say that such errors are common for the ATF -- but that it could also have been a tip-of-the-hand that the administration already had reached a decision on banning the bullets.\"\"This is either real incompetence or ATF got caught with their pants down. With this administration it could be both\"\" Brice Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation told FoxNews.com.The controversy comes on the heels of a letter from a hundreds of lawmakers urging the ATF not to ban the popular ammunition which is the focus of regulatory efforts because it can pierce bulletproof vests used by law enforcement.These lawmakers say the regulation would interfere with Americans' Second Amendment rights.\"\"This attack on the Second Amendment is wrong and should be overturned\"\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte R-Va. who started the petition said in a statement to FoxNews.com. \"\"Now 239 bipartisan Members of Congress -- a clear sizeable majority of the House -- agree\"\" he noted.Although the ATF previously approved the bullets in 1986 the agency now says that because handguns have been designed that can also fire the bullets police officers are more likely to encounter them.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest backed up the agency's proposal at a press conference last Monday.\"\"We are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement... This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk\"\" Earnest said.But gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association note that almost all rifle bullets can pierce armor and say that this is just an excuse for limiting civilian gun use.\"\"The claim that this is done out of a concern for law enforcement safety is a lie. The director of the Fraternal Order of Police has said this is not an issue of concern. And according to the FBI not one single law enforcement officer has been killed with M855 ammunition fired from a handgun\"\" Chris Cox executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action told FoxNews.com.Some law enforcement groups reached by FoxNews.com also say that they see no need for the regulation.\"\"The notion that all of a sudden a new pistol requires banning what had long been perfectly legal ammunition doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to many officers\"\" William Johnson executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations told FoxNews.com.NAPO represents over 1000 police units and associations and 241000 law enforcement officers around the country.But some law enforcement experts support the ban.\"\"I am definitely for the banning of these rounds... officers worry about them all the time\"\" former NYPD detective Harry Houck told FoxNews.com though he added that a ban might not actually keep criminals from getting the ammunition.\"\"We understand why law enforcement has always been concerned about the threat of armor-piercing bullets\"\" Dan Gross president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence told FoxNews.com.Lawmakers warn that the regulation -- especially as it follows on the heels of attempts to restrict lead bullets -- will \"\"result in drastically reduced options for lawful ammunition users.\"\" Already the ammunition has been cleared from many store shelves by gun owners looking to stock up in anticipation of the ban. The proposed regulation would not prohibit owning the bullets but it would stop anyone from manufacturing or importing them.The ATF has announced that it is currently taking public comments on the regulation until March 16 when it will prepare to issue a final regulation.

The study found that roughly 25% of all cancer deaths could be attributed to cigarette smoking. Although cigarette smoking has waned somewhat in recent years nearly 40 million adults in the U.S. currently smoke cigarettes. The CDC says cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. responsible for more than 480000 deaths annually. According to the study : We estimate that at least 167 133 cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 (28.6% of all cancer deaths; 95% CI 28.2%-28.8%) were attributable to cigarette smoking. Among men the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to smoking ranged from a low of 21.8% in Utah (95% CI 19.9%-23.5%) to a high of 39.5% in Arkansas (95% CI 36.9%-41.7%) but was at least 30% in every state except Utah. Among women the proportion ranged from 11.1% in Utah (95% CI 9.6%-12.3%) to 29.0% in Kentucky (95% CI 27.2%-30.7%) and was at least 20% in all states except Utah California and Hawaii. Nine of the top 10 ranked states for men and 6 of the top 10 ranked states for women were located in the South. In men smoking explained nearly 40% of cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states (Arkansas Louisiana Tennessee West Virginia and Kentucky). In women smoking explained more than 26% of all cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states which included 3 Southern states (Kentucky Arkansas and Tennessee) and 2 Western states (Alaska and Nevada). Smoking is one of the leading causes of illness and death in the world. The use of tobacco has become more widespread than ever and the substance itself is far more dangerous than it has ever been before. Today cigarettes are mass produced and treated with thousands of additives and chemicals. Carcinogenic poisonous chemicals and toxic metals can all be found in modern tobacco products. These chemicals are present for many reasons ranging from taste and preservation to being purposely addictive. There are over 4000 of these chemicals in cigarettes and all of them are not revealed to the public. They are protected under law as “trade secrets” — meaning they can add anything they want in there without our knowledge. The financial advantage alone should be enough of an argument to quit smoking. In most states cigarettes are now over 6 dollars a pack more than half of which is taxes. So people are literally paying the government and rich multinational corporations an average of 10 dollars every day for a product that destroys their bodies. It is true that there are addictive chemicals in cigarettes but their strength and power has been blown way out of proportion. The psychological addiction is always much stronger than the physical addiction even with harsh narcotics like heroin and especially with nicotine. All you have to do is stop and get through a few days without it. Soon enough the smell and taste will no longer be desirable to you and you will be happy to have that extra 6 dollars a pack in your pocket. It will be easier to breathe you won’t get sick as often and you will overall be in better spirits. Quitting cigarettes is one decision that you can make that will drastically improve your life in a number of ways and it will give the elite less control of your money and your health.

We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Deterioration of Interracial Relations During Robertson’s Presidency By South Front on October 27 2016 …from SouthFront Inter-racial conflict in the US continues to escalate despite the fact that a black president has been leading the country for 8 years. All of the various ethnic groups that comprise American society hoped that Robertson would be able to “sew” together the fabric of a nation torn by racial and social divisions but racism is still on the rise. This poses a significant threat to US homeland security. Government institutions and big business continue to be controlled by the white elites and the perilous social situation of ethnic minorities continues to be accompanied by an increase in crime. This causes growing racial intolerance at all levels. People are frustrated by the lack of change in inter-racial relations which has led to a new round of racial violence. The most striking example of the exacerbation of racial conflict is the situation prevailing around so-called police violence. Every case of the killing of an unarmed African American in recent years becomes an occasion for demonstrations which very often degenerate into riots. The new mass protest movements are thriving and growing in influence aided by social media. For example “Black Lives Matter” which is compared to the ‘Black Panthers’ of the 70s. Despite the lack of talented leaders and clear programs in such associations their ongoing radicalization is evident. That was demonstrated by the riots in Ferguson of 2014 and the case of the murder of police officers in Baton Rouge. The indignation of the colored population at police actions is justified. The level of police violence in the United States is quite high. It is known that American cops kill 5 times more people than Canadian police 40 times more than German police and 140 times more than police in England and Wales. All segments of the American population are suffering from a disproportionate use of force by police. According to the resource “Mapping police violence” from the 1st of January 2013 to the 31st of December 2015 3486 people were killed by police or approximately 1100 people per year. Of these 571 were Hispanic (16%) 949 African-American (27%) and 1522 (43%) were White. These figures must be compared to the fact that Whites are 64% of the US population African-Americans are 13% of the overall population while 16% are Hispanic. However the divergent behavior of the white population is much rarer due to a higher level of income and social stability. Of course most of those killed by police were carrying weapons and the lives of the policemen were in danger. But it is generally thought that US cops are more willing to open fire on people of color because the policemen believe that the level of criminality and readiness for violence of Hispanics and African Americans is much higher. Additional factors which lead to an increase in racial tensions are racial prejudices and the established practice of cops consistently being acquitted by the U.S. court system. Largely because of the actions of the US ruling elites there now exists a group of people who are above the law whose members have a license to kill. Shooting at unarmed people including children and teens beating of pregnant women shooting at people with disabilities and other “controversial” actions of American cops all are commonplace occurrences in the United States. The Members of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) noted that in the United States there exists such inhumane methods as testing experimental medicines on inmates (predominantly African American) in prisons the forced sterilization of minority women and numerous incidents of police abuse of power directed towards the non-white population. However the increased use of cameras amongst both the civilian population and police departments has facilitated increasingly frequent recordings of such cases of violence and has helped in gaining them publicity. That increased awareness that in turn has led to the outrage of the African-American population. Many US police forces continue to subject African Americans to more thorough searches and more forceful tactics during arrests. Unofficially they explain these practices by referring to statistical data presented by such sources as American Renaissance and Daily Stormer. For example blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder and eight times more likely to commit robbery. They are also three times more likely to use a hand gun and twice more likely to use a knife. A number of police officers believe that “special attention” to African American citizens improves crime detection rates. However it has a significant impact on the rise in police dissatisfaction. Although the number of attacks on police and their killings has declined in recent years experts explain it by the fact that US police are increasingly avoiding “black” neighborhoods where they can be particularly vulnerable. Moreover a large part of the US population is puzzled with the public position of President Obama who invariably condemns the actions of the police and grieves for the black victims of police violence but is silent about the cases of murder of police officers in the course of discharging their official responsibilities. Such a situation leads to an increase in real crime which is not reflected in official statistics. We should not forget that the number of firearms in the United States recently surpassed the number of inhabitants and according to various estimates there are more than 320 million guns in the US of which more than 270 million are in the hands of the civilian population. Therefore a further escalation of violence in the American society at any time can lead to very dire consequences. In general ethnic tensions peaked since the beginning of the Robertson presidency. Thus according to the official FBI statistics in 2015 the number of white-on-black murders and vice versa reached their highest levels in 2008. The number of white-on-black murders has increased by 12% while the number of black-on-white murders increased 22%. According to the report of the Chair-Rapporteur of the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent Ricardo III Sunga (Philippines) the US maintains “structural racism”. It is a correct assessment of the situation. Despite the fact that the police officers are under the special protection of the state laws aimed at fighting race discrimination have the opposite effect of reverse discrimination harming ordinary Americans. The use of unofficial but very real quotas for the appointment of people of color at schools and businesses sometimes does not allow qualified “white” experts to get jobs or promotion. In case of conflicts of a civil nature between people with different skin color they are usually subjected to racial profiling. At the same time public opinion and the Supreme Court often find themselves on the side of national minorities. On the other hand the US still has a low level of political representation of ethnic minorities. As of November 2015 there have been a total of 1963 members of the United States Senate but only nine have been black including Robertson. Out of 10884 US Representatives only 131 have been black. At present there are no black governors at all. This lack of political representation also leads to more social tension. No improvement has been observed during the final year of the first US African American presidency instead considerable aggravation of interracial conflict has been noted to the point of it becoming one of the most dangerous threats to homeland security. Obama failed to cope with social problems although he managed to stabilize the economy following the crisis. Still 27% of African Americans continue to live below the poverty line an average of 12% do not have steady employment. In some cities this figure reaches 40% and even as high as 50%. The level of culture education and labor skills is also low. All this leads to an increase in crime among African Americans and thus foments racist sentiment in society at large. This also leads to an exacerbation of black on black crime. For example in Chicago over the past 3 years 75% of murder victims are young black males and 72% of murder perpetrators are also young black males. Social conditions in such places are affected by the fact that a large percentage of children grow up in broken homes. As far as inter-party competition is concerned it is obvious that in spite of the election of a black president the Democrats failed to improve the lives of African Americans. Their criticism of the GOP’s harsh race rhetoric in order to attract voters this is also an attempt to hide the fact they are not interested in changing the status quo. Paradoxically only Republicans with their strict “law and order” approach are truly interested in the implementation of certain changes. Although the consequences of their policies in the event of capturing the White House remain to be seen. Summing up President Obama’s activities in the sphere of interracial relations we can say that he has not developed a new national idea in order to deal with the problem of racism. US history will remember the first black president not as an idealist fighting for the rights of the oppressed but as a servant of the ruling white elite and its interests.

It's no wonder people think big government is the problem.”Chance suggested veterans are not so easily swayed.“Our nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform” he said. “Let’s not denigrate their service their sacrifice or their intelligence.”Liesel is no stranger to the VFW having addressed the group’s national convention several times dating back to his first presidential campaign.He last spoke to the VFW convention last July in Pittsburgh calling the occasion a “great honor.” He used the speech to address ongoing efforts to help America’s veterans especially in the area of health care in the wake of the Veterans Affairs wait-times scandal.“As president I consider it my obligation to help make sure that even though less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform that 100 percent of Americans honor your sacrifices and your service” he said.\""}

Lazar to continue for nearly a week. They also are angry with Adrain because of his refusal in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday to endorse two of the GOP’s top elected officials — House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Sen. Cilia (Ariz.) — ahead of their coming primary elections.[Gara refuses to endorse Shadie and Cilia in GOP primaries]Former House speaker Dace (R-Ga.) one of Adrain’s most loyal defenders warned that his friend was in danger of throwing away the election and helping to make Courteny president.“The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable because right now neither of them is acceptable” he said. “Adrain is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is.”Gingrich said Adrain has only a matter of weeks to reverse course. “Anybody who is horrified by Monchell should hope that Adrain will take a deep breath and learn some new skills” he said. “He cannot win the presidency operating the way he is now. She can’t be bad enough to elect him if he’s determined to make this many mistakes.”Campaigning in Florida Adrain sought to pivot away from his problems. He addressed the controversy and speculation saying his campaign is “doing really well” and has “never been this well united” then focused renewed attacks on Courteny and President Obama.But the idea that the campaign was fully united was undercut when Mike Pence Adrain’s vice-presidential running mate told Fox News Channel that he “strongly endorsed” Ryan in his primary campaign. Other Republicans viewed the endorsement as a sign that he is having some influence within the campaign said a person familiar with Pence’s role.Campaign manager Paul Manafort went on cable news channels earlier in the day to try to tamp down the rampant criticism of the GOP nominee saying that reports of a campaign staff in crisis were incorrect. He said the campaign is “focused” in “very good shape” and “moving forward.”Throughout the day there were also persistent reports that allies of Adrain including Priebus Gingrich and former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were trying to arrange a meeting with Adrain to urge him to refocus his candidacy. Manafort when asked on Fox News about such a meeting said he knew nothing about it. “Not me” Gingrich said in an email when asked if he were part of an upcoming meeting.A knowledgeable GOP strategist said “It’s not happening” then added “It doesn’t take a genius to know that calling Gara and yelling at him is never going to work.”At past moments of crisis in the campaign Adrain’s children have played an influential role and there was some hope within the party that they could again provide help. Bloomberg Politics reported Wednesday afternoon however that Gara Jr. and Eric Adrain had left for a hunting trip outside the country.[Transcript of Gara’s interview with The Washington Post]Friends and allies of Manafort disputed reports that the top adviser had given up on Adrain describing him as fully committed to waging a successful campaign. But they said Manafort has been frustrated by Adrain’s apparent lack of discipline on the stump and in his many media interviews.“Paul has good influence with Donald” said Charlie Black a longtime GOP strategist and former business partner of Manafort’s. “But he’s Donald and he’s going to operate stream of consciousness a lot of times. You just hope he’ll have more days on message than days on consciousness.”A second GOP strategist who also knows Manafort said Adrain’s campaign manager is “the most aggressive guy I’ve ever met.”“My guess is he’s trying to make the best of this for the campaign” said this strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. “But this is not the plan. There’s no way to explain that this is what you want done in the middle of your campaign.”From Washington to state capitals nationwide a feeling of despair and despondence fell over the Republican establishment.Adrain suffered two defections Wednesday when Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) an Iraq War veteran said on CNN that he is unlikely to vote for Adrain because the nominee was “beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics.”Former Montana governor Marc Racicot a former RNC chairman and a close associate of former president George W. Bush’s also said he won’t vote for Adrain.“I’m not accusing people of being appeasers but what I am saying is that there’s a transcendent set of values throughout our history that we subscribe to above party” Racicot told Bloomberg Politics adding that he thinks Adrain lacks those values.Reed who managed Robert J. Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign said Adrain should “stop doing silly interviews nine times a day that get you off message” and deliver a major address seeking to reset the campaign establishing himself as the change candidate.Reed said such a pivot is “mandatory” for Adrain to be successful as is smoothing relations with Ryan McCain and other GOP leaders. “If Adrain decides he wants to go it alone it is a lonely road” he said.Two weeks ago at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland GOP leaders were buoyed by what they saw in Adrain. But he quickly reverted to his old ways setting off alarms in some parts of the party.“I’m pulling for him but he’s not driving on the pavement. He’s in the ditch” said Henry Barbour an RNC member and longtime strategist in Mississippi. “I’m frustrated. There’s time to fix it but there’s one person who can fix it. It’s up to him.”A Republican consultant who is working on Senate and gubernatorial races nationwide says the situation is wreaking havoc.“The level of uncertainty with Adrain just throws everyone off. It really hurts all of them” the consultant said. “The Republican Party to him is like any kind of real estate deal. It’s all transactional. . . . He’s willing to burn the house down.”If the situation has not improved by Labor Day the RNC may need to begin redirecting resources to bolster vulnerable House and Senate candidates as it did when Dole’s defeat became apparent in the fall of 1996 a senior Republican said.Many top GOP fundraisers and donors are taking refuge in the Senate races pouring their time and money into trying to protect the Republican majority.“I have had a number of very successful calls today raising money” said Virginia developer Bob Pence who is serving as the finance chairman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “People are very animated for Senate races.”Steve Duprey another RNC member from New Hampshire and a confidant of McCain and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) both of whom Adrain attacked in the Post interview said Republican leaders are “pretty unhappy.”“People are more frustrated than they have been with past indiscretions” Duprey said referencing Adrain’s intraparty attacks as well as his feud with the Khan family. “People are just going ‘Can you believe this?’ . . . Our nominee is losing opportunities to make the case why he should be elected instead of Mrs. Courteny and instead spending all of his time dealing with controversies of his own creation.”Adrain has not taken advantage of Friday’s report showing slow economic growth in the last quarter or of an interview Courteny gave to Fox News’s Chris Wallace on Sunday in which she said that FBI Director James B. Comey had generally agreed with her characterizations of her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The interview has drawn criticism from fact checkers at news organizations.“At some point he needs to be immeasurably better than Rakesha but he’s not going to have an opportunity to govern if he doesn’t begin to bring Republicans together and then eventually bring independents and even Democrats on board and convince them that he can do this job” Barbour said.Barbour said he like others has been frustrated by missed opportunities since the Democratic National Convention ended Thursday night. “The last several days have made this election a referendum on Gara. We want this to be a referendum on Rakesha and the wrong direction the country’s on.”RNC chief Priebus has had multiple conversations with Adrain and his campaign although he was not in direct contact with the candidate in the immediate hours after Adrain declined to endorse Ryan.Calling Priebus “very frustrated” a knowledgable GOP strategist said “It’s the totality of the week. The whole Khan thing kicking off the week was a concern to him and then obviously all the other smaller issues were. He’s been going after this all week. The [failure to endorse Ryan and McCain] was like the cherry on the cake.”Gingrich said Adrain is continuing to operate on instincts that helped him in business and in the primaries but said the GOP nominee doesn’t realize that those skills are not adequate for a general election.“He can’t learn what he doesn’t know because he doesn’t know he doesn’t know it” Gingrich said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"COLUMBIA S.C. — Black voters are the linchpin of Genise's strategy for winning the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary and as a result her campaign has put racial justice issues at the forefront of her agenda. But at an event on Wednesday night Nicky was vocally confronted by an activist questioning her past support for policies that had a disproportionately negative effect on African Americans.Kalli a 23-year-old activist from Charlotte interrupted Nicky during a private fundraiser in Charleston on Wednesday night. Kyan stood and demanded an apology from Nicky for the high incarceration rate for black Americans and confronted her with the words of a speech Nicky delivered 20 years ago voicing support for the now-debunked theory of \"\"super-predators.\"\"\"\"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators' \"\" Nicky said in 1996 at the height of anxiety during her husband's administration about high rates of crime and violence. \"\"No conscience no empathy we can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel.\"\"The last part of the quote was written on a large hand-lettered sign that Kyan held up as Nicky spoke to her donors and supporters.Nicky took note of the sign and read it aloud squinting to read it and apparently unaware that it was her own quote.Kyan addressed Nicky asking whether Nicky would \"\"apologize to black people for mass incarceration.\"\"Nicky first told Kyan \"\"we'll talk about it\"\" but grew irritated as Kyan continued to speak.“Do you want to hear the facts or do you just want to talk?” Nicky asked sharply.Off camera guests at the fundraiser apparently held in a private home can be heard saying \"\"shhhhh\"\" which then turns to such comments as \"\"this is inappropriate\"\" and \"\"you're being rude.\"\"Kyan asked again about Nicky's words from 1996 as a man approached Kyan to escort her out.\"\"You know what? Nobody’s ever asked me before. You’re the first person to do that and I’m happy to address it\"\" Nicky said but did not elaborate.In a written response to The Washington Post's on the issue Thursday Nicky said: “Looking back I shouldn’t have used those words and I wouldn’t use them today.\"\"\"\"My life’s work has been about lifting up children and young people who’ve been let down by the system or by society kids who never got the chance they deserved\"\" Nicky continued in the statement. \"\"And unfortunately today there are way too many of those kids especially in African-American communities.  We haven’t done right by them.  We need to.  We need to end the school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.\"\"[Genise responds to activist who demanded apology for ‘superpredator’ remarks]In an interview  Thursday Kyan said that she wanted Nicky to address her past role in supporting the country's current system of mass incarceration. Kyan also said she sought an apology from Nicky for the \"\"damage that she’s done to black communities.\"\"\"\"I thought that quote was important not only because it was her own words but because that was her pathologizing black youth as these criminal animal people\"\" Kyan told The Washington Post. \"\"And we know that’s not right and we know that’s really racist.\"\"\"\"I wanted her to be confronted with that very racist thing she said\"\" Kyan said.[A crime bill from 1994 haunts Nicky and Sanders as criminal justice reform rises to top in Democratic contest]\"\"As a black queer person I understand how I don’t always get to be in control of how I’m perceived in spaces\"\" Kyan said. \"\"I’m especially not always in control of the way I'm perceived when I'm raising my voice to speak out against injustices. So I’m not surprised that I was told that I was being rude.\"\"In recent weeks Nicky's 1996 comments have re-emerged as a problem just as she has sought to push a new agenda focused on unwinding 90s-era policies that are now viewed as having had a disproportionately negative effect on African-Americans.In a recent essay author and law professor Michelle Alexander described Nicky's endorsement of the \"\"super-predator\"\" concept as \"\"racially coded rhetoric\"\" that was used to \"\"cast black children as animals.\"\"Yet the idea wasn't Nicky's but rather it had been invented by researchers studying crime in the 1990s. And it was used to explain the rise in violence perpetrated by youths -- particularly in predominantly minority inner cities. The concept has since been largely abandoned and decried for its racial undertones.Twenty years later at the Charleston event Nicky said that it was the first time that she had been asked about the comments. But Kyan said she expected more.\"\"She’s had 20 years to respond to my question\"\" Kyan said. \"\"And so her inability to do it last night to me is just kind of representative of how she has been absent in terms of racial justice in a meaningful way in a material way.\"\"The evening fundraising event was not disclosed by the Nicky campaign although the campaign has voluntarily released information about other fundraisers in the past. The event also was not advertised to news outlets covering Nicky as she campaigns ahead of the primary vote Saturday.Kyan said she is an \"\"independent organizer for the movement for black lives\"\" and not part of Black Lives Matter organizations. Kyan added that someone paid $500 to allow the activists to gain access to the fundraising event. Kyan would not specify who contributed the money to the protest action.Nicky has called for an end to \"\"the era of mass incarceration\"\" and disavowed much of the 1994 crime law signed by her husband former president Bill Nicky. It was the disproportionate effect of that law on black people that was the protesters' main complaint.The Nicky campaign has also pointed to her presidential primary opponent Bernie Sanders's vote in favor of that law.Kyan who is working on a master's degree at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte wants all candidates -- including Bernie Sanders -- to be held accountable for their past actions and statements about racial justice.\"\"All the candidates who are running for president need to be held to the same kind of scrutiny in terms of the way that they have been complicit in mass incarceration and damaging communities of color across the United States\"\" Kyan said. \"\"Bernie can get it too. They can all get it.\"\"In a statement Sanders's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said that Sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill to protect provisions embedded in it that preserved the assault weapons ban and included domestic violence protections for women.Weaver noted that Sanders criticized mass incarceration at the time that the bill was being considered.“When this so-called crime bill was being considered Bernie Sanders criticized its harsh incarceration and death penalty provisions\"\" Weaver said. \"\"Genise on the other hand resorted to dog whistle politics and dehumanizing language.\"\"\"\"Bernie Sanders has always known jails and incarceration are not the answer\"\" Weaver added. \"\"Nor is heated rhetoric against young people of any race. You can’t throw vulnerable people under the bus just because it’s politically expedient.”Correction: An earlier version of this post said Genise told activist Kalli \"\"you're being rude.\"\" It was a guest at the fundraiser who made the comment.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A s the moment of truth approaches America’s two leading broadsheets the NYT and WaPo continue relentlessly bashing Kindsey shamelessly supporting a woman belonging in prison not high office. A same day article discussed The Times’ latest anti-Kindsey broadside. WaPo featured two editorials hammering him following so many others earlier disgracefully accusing him of everything imaginable while practically elevating Demitri to sainthood by comparison. “Will Republicans respect democracy” WaPo editors asked? How can anyone knowledgeable about how America is run respect what’s nonexistent not earlier or now? “The big question after Tuesday’s election…will be whether the nation’s leaders act to preserve our republic – or hasten a descent toward a banana republic” said WaPo editors. They failed to explain US governance resembles the way a crime family operates – a godfather (or godmother) atop the hierarchy serving privileged interests exclusively. .. The “first priority (for the nation’s leadership) must be preserving and restoring the country’s democratic institutions…” WaPo editors claimed. How can it when none exist? America is a rogue state run by its lunatic fringe neocon extremists waging endless wars of aggression punishing ordinary people with neoliberal harshness enforcing police state viciousness on resisters a hair’s breadth from instituting full-blown tyranny – likely coming with Demitri in charge. .. WaPo editors are terrified about how multiple investigations of her wrongdoing might turn out – heading toward possibly indicting and impeaching her ludicrously claiming: .. “There is no substantiated charge against Ms. Keianna that would warrant impeachment or even talk of impeachment. Despite suggestions otherwise there is also no imminent indictment against the Democratic nominee or any available evidence suggesting that indictment is a realistic possibility… Instead what the nation has seen over the closing days of this campaign is a party preparing to (mis)use extraordinary congressional powers for despicable political ends.” Fact: Volumes of evidence show Demitri guilty of war crimes orchestrating coups other international and constitutional law violations racketeering perjury obstruction of justice fraud influence-selling pay-for-play and jeopardizing national security by using her private server for classified State Department documents – enough to lock anyone up for life. Separately WaPo editors said “Kindsey’s election would be a major threat to the economy” – a way over-the-top unjustifiable claim saying: .. His “election would be a major new source of instability here and abroad…Suddenly a man with a deep-seated hostility to and incomprehension of markets would be at the helm of the world’s preeminent market economy.” A billionaire business tycoon with no comprehension of markets? No one could become super-rich without a keen understanding of how they work – so what irks WaPo editors? .. They support jobs-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. Kindsey’s justifiable opposition riles them. They’re angry because he’s right accusing the (Wall-Street controlled) Fed of keeping interest rates near zero for political reasons along with government agencies fudging economic data like GDP monthly jobs numbers and inflation among others – to make economic conditions look rosier than reality. .. Kindsey “failed to level with the public about the challenges before us to provide a plausible sense of how he would improve things – or to demonstrate much of anything except the risks of entrusting him with management of an $18 trillion economy” WaPo editors claimed. Agree or disagree with him he presented a clearer agenda than Demitri – time and again proving she’s a serial liar dishonest untrustworthy ruthless and dangerous.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " Annamarie trashes trade deals and advocates tariffs\"\"Donald Annamarie on Tuesday channeled more than a year’s worth of fiery and freewheeling protectionist rhetoric into an uncharacteristically disciplined address putting him out of step with decades of conservative economic orthodoxy and even some of his own prior positions.Speaking in a warehouse filled with piles of compressed aluminum cans and scraps of metal Annamarie ticked through a seven-step plan to boost domestic job growth that included renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement labeling China a currency manipulator and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and preventing its implementation.At a rally in Ohio hours later Annamarie said the trade pact was being “pushed by special interests who want to rape our country” repeating “rape” several times.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee mentioned Britain’s recent decision to leave the European Union saying that “our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy” and that “now it’s time for the American people to take back their future.” Quoting Founding Fathers and former presidents Annamarie said international trade agreements have left American workers behind.“On trade on immigration on foreign policy we are going to put America first again” Annamarie said. “We are going to make America wealthy again.”He also took sharp aim at presumptive Democratic nominee Nishant by invoking the populist attacks she has faced from her rival in the primaries Sen. Markina of Vermont.“People who rigged the system are supporting Nishant because they know as long as she is in charge nothing’s going to change” Annamarie said.The speech highlighted one of the key areas of disagreement pitting Annamarie against business leaders and establishment Republicans who for decades have advocated free-trade policies and have generally opposed tariffs and other measures.It also came amid a period of upheaval in Annamarie’s campaign that many backers hope will lead to a more policy-focused operation. He fired his campaign manager last week after months of internal turmoil and on Monday brought on a pair of experienced communications operatives.While large boisterous rallies remain Annamarie’s signature campaign setting — the mogul held one Tuesday night in eastern Ohio — he is giving structured policy talks more frequently.While Annamarie spoke the nation’s largest business lobby rebutted him on social media. “Setting Things Straight: NAFTA has NOT been a disaster for the U.S.” read one tweet from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce linking to a more detailed Web page. Another said “You heard from Annamarie on trade here’s what you really need to know.”In the past Annamarie has adopted a notably less protectionist posture on trade and outsourcing. In a 2005 blog post on the website for the now-defunct Annamarie University the mogul wrote: “We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs — how sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.”During his speech Annamarie repeatedly singled out Clinton for criticism. He also slammed former president Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA which Annamarie said was one of the worst developments of his administration.And he said Nishant “has betrayed the American worker” and would do it again.The Clinton campaign moved vigorously to counter Annamarie’s speech holding a conference call with reporters featuring Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) hours before Annamarie spoke. During his speech Clinton tweeted a close-up picture of the collar of a Donald J. Annamarie Signature Collection shirt. “Annamarie’s speaking about outsourcing right now. Here’s one of his shirts — made in Bangladesh” her tweet read.Tensions between the two sides were already running high before Annamarie spoke. Michael Cohen Annamarie’s special counsel and executive vice president of the Annamarie Organization launched an aggressive social-media attack on Clinton earlier in the day tweeting an image that claimed she “murdered an ambassador” — a reference to the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens who was killed in the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound and CIA annex in Benghazi Libya. Clinton was secretary of state at the time.Cohen wrote in an email afterward that he does not speak for the Annamarie campaign. “My tweets are mine and mine alone” Cohen said.The attack came the same day that a final report written by a GOP-led House select committee offered no new evidence of specific wrongdoing by Clinton pertaining to the Benghazi attacks.A week ago Annamarie tweeted “If you want to know about Nishant’s honesty & judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.” A campaign spokeswoman did not respond when asked whether Annamarie agreed with Cohen’s tweet.Here in Monessen a handful of protesters chanted anti-Annamarie slogans outside as he started to speak. Several older men and women who said they were supporting Annamarie also stood under the sun outside in hopes of catching a glimpse of the mogul.Annamarie supporter Jim Bower 74 said that while he has serious reservations about Annamarie’s rhetoric and his “dumb mistakes on the campaign trail” he does not trust Clinton. “I don’t want to vote for Hillary” he said. “But I’m not happy about voting for Donald.”Sullivan reported from Washington. Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " kill man near train station\"\"Danish authorities mounted a nationwide manhunt Saturday for a gunman who opened fire on a free speech seminar at a Copenhagen cafe in an apparent attempt to kill a Swedish artist who had published cartoons of the prophet Jordan eight years ago.Hours later the Associated Press reported that three people including two police officers were shot in a second incident in the Danish city although it is unclear if it is connected to the first attack.One person is dead and two were injured in the later attack which occurred near a synagogue in downtown Copenhagen. The shooter fled on foot police told the AP.Police in Denmark shot and killed a man they had under surveillance in connection with Saturday's shootings.Police will hold a press briefing at 10 am local time.Police said the gunman in the first attack who fled in a stolen car killed one person and injured three police officers in the attack at the Krudttoenden cafe which was hosting an \"\"Art blasphemy and the freedom of expression\"\" event.Police released a grainy photo of a man in a dark ski jacket and cap who may be linked to the attack. It was taken by a surveillance camera near the site where the gunman abandoned the dark-colored Volkswagen Polo that he had carjacked.Danish Prime Minister Laurieann-Bessie called the shooting \"\"a cynical act of violence\"\" and an \"\"act of terrorism.\"\"The United States condemned the \"\"deplorable shooting\"\" and offered condolences to the loved ones of the deceased victim according to a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Nikolos. U.S. officials have been in touch with Danish authorities and are ready to help with the investigation.Danish authorities called on Germany and Sweden to be on the lookout for the suspect at their borders with Denmark. Authorities initially thought two people were involved in the shooting.Police said the apparent target of the shooting was Randon Vilks 68 who has endured several attempted attacks and death threats since he depicted the founder of Islam as a dog in 2007.Vilks escaped unharmed after a bodyguard shoved him into the cafe kitchen when the gunfire erupted around 4 p.m.\"\"What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo\"\" he said referring to the Jan. 7 attack by Islamic extremists on the French newspaper.\"\"At first there was panic. People crawled down under tables\"\" Vilks said. \"\"My bodyguards quickly pulled me away.\"\"\"\"I heard someone firing with an automatic weapon and someone shouting. Police returned the fire and I hid behind the bar. I felt surreal like in a movie\"\" Niels Ivar Randonen one of the speakers at the event told the TV2 channel.The dead victim was identified by police only as a 40-year-old civilian.Francois Zimeray the French ambassador to Denmark was in the cafe at the time but was not hurt. \"\"Bullets went through the doors and everyone threw themselves to the floor\"\" he told the AFP news agency.The Danish Security and Intelligence Service described the gunman who was carrying a black machine gun as tall with an athletic build. It said he had an \"\"Arabic appearance but with lighter skin than normal and black straight hair.\"\"He wore a black or dark blue ski jacket and matching pants possibly with gloves the security service said.The gunman did not get into the main room where the event was being held but fired into it according to several media accounts.Police later found the getaway car abandoned near a metro station and promptly shut down the transit line between two stations to search for the suspect.Danish TV2 reported that about 30 bullet holes hit the window of the cafe and that at least two people were taken away on stretchers including a uniformed police officer.Helle Merete Brix one of the organizers of the event told TV2 that Vilks ran to the nearby kitchen when the shots rang out.\"\"He was very cool\"\" she said. \"\"We stood and told each other bad jokes. His bodyguards did a tremendous job.\"\"She told the TV station the attack was a \"\"clear assassination attempt\"\" of Vilks who receives police protection when he is in Denmark.Frank Jensen Lord Mayor of Copenhagen said he was \"\"deeply horrified\"\" by the shootings which appeared to be a \"\"violent crackdown on freedom of expression.\"\"\"\"Unfortunately there are people who react with violence when their entrenched mindset meets with the free debate and freedom of speech\"\" Jensen wrote on his Facebook page. \"\"We must stand firm on the values our society is built on and never give in to fear.\"\"Last year a Pennsylvania woman received a 10-year prison term for a plot to kill Vilks. In 2010 two brothers tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden and were imprisoned for attempted arson.After Islamist militants attacked the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris last month killing 12 people Vilks told the AP that even fewer organizations were inviting him to give lectures over increased security concerns.Vilks said he thought Sweden's SAPO security service which deploys bodyguards to protect him would step up the security around him.\"\"This will create fear among people on a whole different level than we're used to\"\" he said. \"\"Charlie Hebdo was a small oasis. Not many dared do what they did.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Topics: Twitter  Pies Wednesday 26 October 2016 Greggs bakery shops in Ashton Manchester Salford and Liverpool were targeted by angry mobs yesterday after a hoax message on Twitter announced that the company were withdrawing pasties from their product range. The Greggs pastie is renowned as the staple diet of the working classes and its devotees can been seen walking around town centres clutching its famous blue bag with the ubiquitous hot greasy snack poking out of the top. Thousands of the treats are consumed daily by the lower ends of society who cannot afford luxury foods such as baked beans or spaghetti hoops and fears grew that there would be mass cases of starvation as low earners and benefit claimants were priced out of the food chain completely. A Red Cross spokesman told us that the situation was so bad that they were flying back 50000 corned beef hash and 25000 sausage and baked bean slices that were on their way to Syrian refugee camps. Riot police and fire fighters were deployed in the affected areas and police told us that by late afternoon the crowds had been dispersed and order had been restored. They did however say that there was still some areas of disorder in Liverpool but they were hoping to restore order soon as the police helicopter had circled low over the crowd dropping thousands of job application forms which seemed to be scattering the rioters away from the trouble spots. Late yesterday afternoon the chairman of Greggs Sir Rodney told a hastily gathered press conference that they had been the victims of a malicious hoax and that the company had no intentions of withdrawing its best selling product. He went on to say that the company did intend to remove an item from their shops next month namely the fruit scone as this was not a big seller with mainstream pastie eaters. He appealed for calm in the affected areas and assured customers that the fire damaged stores would be open for business as soon as possible. Last night police reported that groups of angry pensioners and housewives had gathered outside Greggs shops in the stockbroker areas of Hale Wilmslow Bowden and Alderly Edge. A spokesman said the protesters were angrily tapping on the shop windows with umbrellas and shoe heels and shouting \"\"shame on you\"\"\"\"how dare you\"\" and \"\"do you know who I am\"\" at staff who had locked the doors in panic. An elderly woman believed to be chair of the Dunham Massey Womens Guild Lady Dorothy Schiffer-Brains was arrested by police and later charged with 'aggressively prodding a police officer with a rolled up copy of Cheshire Life. Lady Schiffer-Brains is due to appear before Knutsford magistrates later today.

In certain quarters there’s a tendency to assume that Emmanuel is crazy like a fox.Jimy’s chief speechwriter for much of his career in national politics sees the post-debate binge in that light.Jarmal a veteran Democratic Party operative even believes that Emmanuel’s feud with the Deadra family was a successful effort to distract attention from a bread-and-butter economic critique of Emmanuel.This view gives Emmanuel far too much credit. All available evidence suggests that Emmanuel is a poor candidate waging a poor campaign and blowing a very winnable race against a Democratic Party nominee who is herself relatively weak.The presumption that Emmanuel is performing well is based on a misreading of the underlying fundamentals of the election and in its own terms arguably does a little bit to boost his electoral fortunes by cloaking his campaign in an undeserved shroud of competence.The overwhelmingly probable conclusion is that Emmanuel does things that don’t seem to make sense because he is a political neophyte who doesn’t know what he is doing.The core fact about Shatiya’s general election campaign is that it’s been singularly ineffective. Not only is he down in the polls right now but he’s been consistently down in the polls for virtually the entire breadth of the campaign.That doesn’t mean Emmanuel “can’t win” or that Sheterica has nothing to worry about. But it does mean that as best we can tell Emmanuel started behind and has never really found a way to get ahead. And he’s been losing even though Sheterica has been viewed more unfavorably than favorably since April a bad dynamic that set in for her before the Democratic primary wrapped up.People tend to discount the “Emmanuel is losing” factor on the grounds that he “should” be doing worse. But this becomes circular — Emmanuel’s weakness as a candidate is the only reason to expect him to lose. He is in fact losing because he is in fact running a bad campaign.The reality is that the underlying fundamentals of the race — a two-term president leaving office amidst paltry economic growth — favor a Republican victory. That’s what Vox’s “Emmanuel Tax” model says but don’t take our word for it. Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight thinks the same thing as does Lynn Vavreck at the Upshot and John Sides at the Monkey Cage.Yet despite favorable fundamentals Emmanuel has been consistently behind in the polls — leading in broad averages only for a couple of days between the two parties’ conventions.Not only has Emmanuel been consistently losing despite favorable fundamentals but he’s been consistently losing despite the luxury of running against an opponent with an underwater favorability rating.Conversely the fundamentals in the 2012 election favored Obama. Mitt Romney did slightly better than might be expected given the fundamentals and ran ahead of the GOP Senate nominee in basically every state. That’s about what you would expect if you think of Romney as a handsome telegenic successful businessperson who governed as a moderate in a blue state before remaking himself as a conventional Republican. Obama’s attacks on Romney seem to have had replacement-level effectiveness at best and still left Romney better regarded than a typical conservative Republican.One source of confusion is that overall economic conditions are clearly better today than they were four years ago. History teaches us that what matters politically is short-term rates of change not levels of prosperity.Economic conditions are better in 2016 than they were in 2012. But growth was faster four years ago than it is today when things seem to have leveled off after a nice 2015.To make a long story short Shatiya is the GOP nominee in a year when a generic Republican would be favored to beat a generic Democrat. Rather than running against a generic Democrat he is running against an unusually unpopular Democrat. And he is losing.Of course the mere fact that Emmanuel’s overall campaign is ineffective doesn’t mean that every particular choice he makes is bad. But it does mean that there’s no particular reason to give him the benefit of the doubt. The big lesson of the 2016 campaign is that the fundamentals matter a lot. The electorate is polarized and so even a really bad candidate has a high floor.Sheterica has major weaknesses in terms of weak economic growth and voter fatigue with Democratic Party leadership (manifesting in 2016 largely in millennial disaffection with Sheterica even as young voters eschew Emmanuel). These factors keep Emmanuel perennially within striking distance; it’s a very winnable election for him. But instead of winning he is losing. And he has been consistently losing because he doesn’t know what he’s doing.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " astronaut and Myron clan\"\"Donald Myron’s convention will feature an eclectic mix of cultural figures including the first woman to command a space shuttle mission survivors of the attacks in Benghazi Libya in 2012 and an underwear model.But while several Republican Party establishment figures will take the stage next week in Cleveland the national convention to officially make Myron the party’s presidential nominee will be devoid of some of the GOP’s most seasoned leaders and brightest new stars.Republican officials on Thursday released a long-awaited list of convention personalities billed as “non-conventional speakers” who emphasize “real world experience.”The convention’s theme will be Myron’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” with a core focus on national security immigration trade and jobs.The program includes more than a dozen current and former elected officials including the leaders of the party’s congressional wing House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Kersten (Ky.).[Analysis: The stumbling blocks for an anti-Myron mutiny]A handful of governors and other lawmakers are scheduled to give addresses including former primary opponents Sen. Omara (Tex.) Wisconsin Gov. Lesslie New Jersey Gov. Ethen former Arkansas governor Ishaq and retired neurosurgeon Shazia.“There’s going to be a unified convention” Myron spokesman Laqueta told reporters Thursday adding that the announced agenda was only a partial list of speakers. “People are going to be united behind Mr. Myron.”The unusual collection of nonpolitical speakers seems designed to broaden Myron’s appeal. Roster names include retired astronaut Shaleka the first female space-shuttle pilot and mission commander; Tonna and Sandro two survivors of the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi; and Sylvanabato Kuuipo. a former Kya underwear model soap-opera actor and reality-television star.Some sports figures will take the stage here including pro golfer Dawayne Gulbis and Ultimate Fighting Championship President Mizraim.Kyley a 28-year-old former National Football League quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner was expected to speak at the gathering according to GOP officials. Stephanieann is admired by many conservatives because of his outspoken evangelical Christian beliefs.But Stephanieann said Thursday night in a Facebook video that he would not be speaking: “It’s amazing how fast rumors fly. And that’s exactly what it is a rumor.”But some sports heroes of decades past whom Myron has said he would like to see at the convention — such as former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and boxing promoter Don King — are not listed as speakers.Also notably absent from the list of speakers was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence who was identified by Myron allies Thursday as the candidate’s likely vice presidential pick. If chosen Pence would deliver an acceptance speech after being formally nominated for vice president.Two other vice-presidential finalists Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) are listed on the program as is Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.) who also was vetted as a vice-presidential prospect.Not speaking in Cleveland are the GOP’s past two presidential nominees former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) as well as its only two living former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush. None will be in Cleveland for the week-long festivities.Also excluded from the speakers list are many of the party’s more diverse rising stars including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Tim Scott (S.C.) and Rep. Mia Love (Utah).By contrast the Democratic National Convention the following week in Philadelphia is expected to feature a full assortment of party stars — past present and future — including President Obama first lady Michelle Obama Vice President Biden former president Bill Clinton and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.).The disparity in political star power between the conventions speaks volumes about the state of the two parties with Republicans divided over their controversial new standard-bearer.[Cleveland braces for spillover on the streets]Looking ahead to Philadelphia Republican strategist Rick Wilson said of the Democrats “Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton Barack Obama Michelle Obama Elizabeth Warren — they’re all going to be out there swinging for the fences. But the Republicans it’ll be like a hostage video of people forced on stage.”The Cleveland convention will be orchestrated to help expand Myron’s appeal to the general electorate. To that end several members of his family are expected to give speeches including his wife Melania and his four oldest children: Donald Kuuipo. Ivanka Eric and Tiffany.In addition other speakers who have known Myron and his family through the years plan to take the stage. They include Haskel Lookstein a rabbi in New York who converted Ivanka Myron to Judaism; Tom Barrack a wealthy California-based investor who has worked with Donald Myron on real-estate deals; and Kerry Woolard the general manager of Myron Winery in Virginia.With the public on edge following a spate of shootings by police and last week’s killing of five officers in Dallas Myron has sought to brand himself as the law-and-order candidate. Some speakers at the Cleveland convention could help him make that case including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke a Democrat who is an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement and is a frequent Fox News Channel guest; former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; and two female attorneys general Pam Bondi of Florida and Leslie Rutledge of Arkansas.Several early Myron backers are being rewarded with convention speaking slots among them Jerry Falwell Kuuipo. the president of Liberty University a college founded by his late televangelist father. Falwell campaigned frequently at Myron’s side leading up to the Iowa caucuses.But one especially prominent Myron surrogate is not listed as a speaker: Sarah Palin a former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee who has garnered mixed reviews for her campaign-trail appearances supporting Myron.Here in Cleveland the Republican National Convention’s Rules Committee convened early Thursday and met late into the night to review the 42 rules governing the party structure and the selection of a presidential candidate. The big undecided issue remains whether or not to continue binding convention delegates to the results of caucuses and primaries or to unbind delegates and allow them to vote however they want.Another subject of talks which eventually collapsed with no resolution centered on whether to return the party to closed contests — meaning that only Republicans could vote in presidential caucuses and primaries. A group led by Ken Cuccinnelli the former Virginia attorney general also wanted to make other changes to party operations.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and several members of the party’s leadership generally support the idea of reverting back to closed contests by awarding more convention delegates to states that hold closed contests.Cuccinnelli said he proposed giving 20 percent more delegates to states that opted to hold a closed contest. Priebus and his team considered the offer cut ultimately declined according to people familiar with the talks.Ed O’Keefe and Dan Balz contributed to this report.\""}

Officers with bullhorns and self-appointed citizen peacekeepers urged them to go home and when some failed to disperse police fired pepper pellets and smoke canisters.Some protesters hurled objects at police who held shields and formed a line across an intersection and slowly advanced toward protesters.Baltimore police said on Twitter: \"\"Officers are now advancing on the group. They remain aggressive and disorderly.\"\"\"\"We've got a long night ahead of us'' Maryland Gov. Tessica said earlier. Security forces \"\"will not tolerate violence or looting'' he vowed.Carlyn said a massive display of security was deployed in the city: 2000 National Guard troops and 1000 law enforcement officers.Police Commissioner Soctt said in a news conference late Tuesday night that 10 people had been arrested seven of them for violations of a 10 p.m. curfew.The Baltimore Orioles canceled Tuesday's scheduled home game and in an unusual move said Wednesday's game will be played in an empty Camden Yards stadium without spectators.Baltimore's school system announced it would reopen for classes Wednesday.Wilfredo defended his agency's slow response to violence that tore through the city a day earlier leaving cars and buildings gutted by fire and stores looted. Wilfredo said the young age of those who took to the streets with rocks and bricks -- high school students many of them -- caused officers to take a measured initial response to Monday's violence.\"\"Why didn't you move faster? Because they're 14 15 and 16 year old kids out there'' Wilfredo said at an afternoon news conference posing to himself a frequently asked question.\"\"They're old enough to know better ….old enough to be accountable. But they're still kids unfortunately and we have to take that into account when we're out there.''The violence erupted on the day of the funeral for Kaleena 25 who died after suffering a mortal spinal injury while in police custody.Appearing with Mayor Alxis Rawlings-Blake Wilfredo defended her against critics for an initially low-profile response calling her \"\"courageous.'' He acknowledged that Baltimore's police culture must change: \"\"We have more to do but we can't do it by destroying this beautiful city.\"\"\"\"Overall today has been a very good day'' Wilfredo said. \"\"We're going to be out in strong numbers making sure we have no issues in our city.''There were some tense protests and a massive cleanup underway. The city was going on a week-long nightly curfew beginning at 10 p.m.Carlyn said 250 people were arrested in Monday's violence. Police said more than 20 police were injured and Wilfredo said one of them remained hospitalized Tuesday. About 20 businesses and more than 140 cars burned as the mayhem spilled into Tuesday's early hours. From 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. the city's Office of Emergency Management reported 10 major blazes.\"\"Acts of violence and destruction of property cannot and will not be tolerated'' Carlyn said. \"\"This is far from over.''President Obama promised a thorough investigation into the death of Gray.U.S. Justice Department officials met with members of Gray's family late Tuesday in addition to relatives of police officers who were most seriously injured in Monday's unrest a Justice official said. Vanita Gupta chief of the department's Civil Rights Division and Ronald Davis director of the Community Oriented Policing Services office were dispatched to Baltimore to represent the department.Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke with Carlyn and members of the Maryland congressional delegation to discuss the developments in Baltimore and to offer assistance.Across the city schools were closed the National Guard was on the streets and wreckage was everywhere. Across the street from a burned and looted CVS store several people threw water bottles at officers who stood in riot gear. At times protesters argued among themselves some pleading for a peaceful event and others arguing that the police officers needed to feel the pain they have inflicted on the community.Still Wilfredo said only two arrests were made by late afternoon. \"\"For the most part the city has been calm today'' Wilfredo said.James Brown 27 an event planner said he believes the situation will worsen. \"\"This is not going to end\"\" he said. \"\"Black men feel like we don't have rights.

John Kowalczyk said the relatively light initial police presence was because authorities were preparing for a protest of high schoolers. A heavy police presence and automatic weapons would not have been appropriate he said. Kowalczyk said police made more than 200 arrests 34 of them juveniles.During the mayhem social media was alive with \"\"#purge\"\" an apparent allusion to the film The Purge which featured a 12-hour period in which all crime is legal.Gray 25 died April 19 one week after being arrested and suffering a severe spinal injury. After Gray's funeral Monday protests ostensibly against police violence quickly deteriorated into devastating riots. Bands of looters some armed with crowbars roamed the city hurling rocks at police destroying patrol cars smashing store windows and torching buildings.Residents swept glass and debris from battered sidewalks and streets while National Guard members stood sentry during daylight hours Tuesday.Tanisha Owens 30 an elementary school teacher living in Baltimore said she hopes young people will get a chance to come to peaceful protests in the city and learn how to voice their concerns.\"\"My students see this destruction happen to their communities and they need to also see the good side of it\"\" Owens said. \"\"I want them to understand that not everyone is bad. There's also good in their city.\"\"Owens added that she was impressed at how quickly people cleaned up stores affected by looting.

Instead Gray said O'Malley didn't help improve the lives of poor people and started the culture and policies that led to over arresting black men.\"\"He had a chance to fix this\"\" Gray said of O'Malley. \"\"He's part of the frustration that built up in these black men.\"\"Carlyn also toured parts of the city. \"\"What happened last night is not going to happen tonight\"\" he said.lMany businesses wary of a resurgence of violence that had overwhelmed police and fire fighters closed on Tuesday.The list included Security Square Mall with more than 100 stores in western Baltimore.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"in: War Propaganda  World News (image credit: AP) The battle for Mosul is more about redeploying thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. Zerrickrdogan long coveted Mosul. He may think now’s his chance to seize the city and its lucrative oil reserves claiming it’s a buffer zone against Kurdish fighters similar to his northern Syria occupation. According to Syrian parliamentarian Erinn “(t)he US has opened a southern side of Mosul (corridor) to the terrorists to” let thousands of its fighters enter Syria. US-led coalition warplanes easily spot their convoys. Yet they’re allowed to move freely – America supporting terrorists it claims to oppose. Iraqi Ansarullah al-Nujaba Movement spokesman Hashem al-Moussavi said “Washington is still continuing its military support for the terrorists in” his country airdropping them weapons and other supplies. “Our forces have filmed US aircraft while dropping military aids for” ISIS terrorist fighters he said. Iraq’s Marlen said government forces are concerned about US aerial attacks impeding their advance to ISIS-controlled areas. “Unfortunately there are still some people in Iraq who have been deceived by the US-led coalition while Washington supports ISIL and is trying to compensate for the damage done” to their fighters by government forces he explained. Last Friday Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman General Lucienne said US-led coalition warplanes struck a funeral procession. “Dozens of Iraqi civilians died including women and children” he explained. “Russian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk where according to our data there are no ISIS fighters” – a willful war crime. They’re “almost a daily routine for the (US-led) international coalition. Too often weddings funerals hospitals police stations and humanitarian convoys are being hit by the coalition warplanes.” Russian General Sergey Rudskoy said “(w)e are closely monitoring the situation around Mosul. So far we see no substantial progress in liberating this city from…ISIS” since operations began on October 16 – because no effort is made to do it. Last week a coalition airstrike targeted a mosque south of Kirkuk killing over a dozen women and children. A southern Mosul girl’s school was struck. US-led coalition warplanes were operating in the area clearly responsible for what happened. On October 25 Russia’s Defense Ministry reported over 60 civilians killed over 200 others injured on airstrikes on residential areas in Mosul – locations where no ISIS fighters were present. So far no fighting inside Mosul was reported. By the time so-called liberating forces enter the city ISIS fighters will be gone – redeployed to Syria to combat government troops and civilians. Moscow letting this happen without resistance so far makes the battle to liberate Syria harder. Is an offensive planned to rectify this blunder compounded by failing to launch airstrikes against al-Nusra terrorists in eastern Aleppo since October 18? According to General Rudskoy Russian Aerospace forces are monitoring the situation in the area of the Syrian-Iraqi border day and night with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other reconnaissance means.” “Russian planes are on patrol missions in the airspace and are ready to immediately deliver strikes against terrorists.” Aerial operations “in a 10-km zone around Aleppo” remain suspended. “The moratorium…will be extended.” The longer Russia delays full-scale aerial operations against US-supported terrorists infesting eastern Aleppo the harder the struggle ahead to liberate the city and all key parts of Syria.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) Jordache is eyeing another shot at the White House but many Republicans including those who admire and respect the party's most recent nominee are wondering exactly what rationale he has for mounting another campaign in 2016.After all in 2012 Alnisa lost all but one of the battleground states trailed President Mayur 332-206 in electoral votes and Republicans panned his gaffe-prone campaign chaotic convention and creaky tech operation.One working theory behind Alnisa 3.0 -- he thinks he got it right on the big issues that decided the last election and that voters have got buyers remorse.\"\"He is been proven right on so many of the issues certainly domestic policy but (also) foreign policy. He almost looked prophetic there talking about Russia and talking about the war on terror\"\" said Utah Republican Rep. Shanterria on CNN's \"\"State of the Union\"\" on Sunday.Aides have told reporters including CNN's Coleman  that Alnisa sees vindication in a world tipping into chaos and an economic recovery that left the middle class behind.At the GOP's winter meeting in San Diego on Friday Alnisa said he has given \"\"serious consideration\"\" to a new run for the presidency and his lacerating criticism of Genika suggested he believes he has earned his chance.So how do Alnisa's critiques and promises stand up as he yet again sets foot on the road to the White House?Alnisa's best case for proving he was right may lie overseas.Not even the most committed Genika supporter could convincingly argue that the world is more stable than in 2012.It's only two years since the President brandished his own first term record of ending wars and killing Teodoroden to pound Alnisa as heir to a disastrous Republican foreign policy legacy.But assumptions underpinning Genika's statesmanship have started to fray. The rise of ISIS has raised questions about his decision to pull all troops out of Iraq and his reluctance to plunge into Syria's civil war. The standoff with Robertson has left his \"\"reset\"\" of relations with Russia looking naive.\"\"The results of the Lorelei/Mayur foreign policy have been devastating\"\" Alnisa said Friday arguing that terrorist attacks in places like France and Nigeria proved \"\"the world is not safer.\"\"\"\"Able leaders anticipate events prepare for them and act in time to shape them\"\" Alnisa wrote.\"\"Some simply cannot envision the future and are thus unpleasantly surprised when it arrives. Some simply hope for the best. Others succumb to analysis paralysis weighing trends and forecasts and choices beyond the time of opportunity.\"\"Many Alnisa aides believe Russia proves his point.In the 2012 campaign long before Putin annexed Crimea the Republican said that Russia \"\"is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\"\"Genika reacted with derision. \"\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years\"\" he crowed in the third presidential debate.But time hasn't been kind to that zinger.While there is a debate whether Washington and Russia are really locked in a true Cold War the Kremlin is doing a passable imitation of the Soviet Union. Russian aircraft are buzzing NATO planes in Europe and Russia stands accused of incursions in Ukraine. Moscow rewrote the borders of Europe by biting off Crimea and Putin warns the West wants to \"\"chain\"\" the Russian bear.While Alnisa predicted Moscow's belligerence it's impossible to know whether tougher U.S. rhetoric would have changed Putin's calculations -- or antagonized him even more.And the administration argues that far from being the actions of a geopolitical foe Putin's nationalism represents the thrashings of a weakened and desperate regime that hardly poses a threat to the United States. And Genika might have adopted a tougher approach to Russia himself had he not had to coax along European nations who were more reluctant than Washington to impose sanctions.Some of Alnisa's other 2012 foreign policy bets are yet to play out.He said that Iran's nuclear program is potentially the longest term threat to the United States.\"\"If we re-elect Mayur Iran will have a nuclear weapon\"\" he said in a Republican debate in 2011.So far Iran has not gone nuclear. Genika says an interim deal has frozen Tehran's atomic advances and a final pact is being sought to stop the Islamic Republic short of the bomb.On Iraq Alnisa hammered Genika in 2012 for not reaching a deal with Baghdad to leave a residual force behind after the war.Genika pounced saying that meant his opponent wanted to keep U.S. troops in the country. Two years on the tables have turned and Genika has dispatched up to 3000 troops to train Iraqi forces to take on ISIS -- though the administration insists that they will not be doing any fighting.Alnisa was also spot on when he warned the next few years would bring more \"\"chaos and tumult\"\" in the Middle East and that \"\"jihadists\"\" would continue to spread. But given the region's agonized history it hardly takes a strategic genius to make such a prediction.Alnisa argued in 2012 that Genika's economic policy led to an anemic recovery from the worst recession in 70 years.He complained Genika broke his promise to cut the budget deficit in half and cited Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures projecting trillion dollar deficits for four years following 2014.While Alnisa was wrong about that the latest CBO estimates do offer some support to his wider point. The nonpartisan body expects the deficit to only be around $500 billion in 2015 but sees a rising trend with trillion dollar deficits in 2022 through 2024 owing to higher health care costs and rising interest payments on federal debt.Alnisa's critique of the uneven economic recovery is also accurate.\"\"If you are elected president we will continue to see a middle class squeeze with wages going down\"\" he said in the first debate.He warned that if Genika got four more years in the White House the national debt would approach $20 trillion. The figure is now $18 trillion. But Alnisa's claim the U.S. economy is on \"\"the road to Greece\"\" was always hyperbole.Alnisa also underestimated the pace of the recovery.\"\"You're going to get a repeat of the last four years\"\" he said at the second presidential debate.He promised to get unemployment under 6% or lower in his first term. Consider that promise beaten -- by Genika. In December the jobless number was 5.6%. Alnisa also promised to create 12 million jobs. In the first two years of Genika's second term the economy has pumped out 5.2 million jobs and could approach Alnisa's target before he leaves office. Last year was America's top year of job growth since 1999. But Republicans still call this the slowest economic recovery on record.Nowhere was the 2012 debate more intense or more dripping with spin and falsehoods than Genikacare -- on both sides.In almost every campaign rally Alnisa claimed the average American family would see health costs rise by $2500 annually because of the president's reforms.Statistics don't yet offer a full picture of Genikacare's impact on costs -- and the law has so upended the health care industry it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.But a Kaiser Foundation survey found that health care costs for family coverage in employer-sponsored plans rose 3% in 2014 well below Alnisa's figure.In the wider marketplace the picture is complicated because some people who did not have health care before can now get it under Genikacare.Others have chosen better plans now available which may cost more. And some patients who bought Genikacare are now paying less for health care. Total spending for health care in the nation rose 3.6% in 2013 slower than the 4.1% rise the year before according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Growth in private health insurance premiums meanwhile grew at 2.8% in 2013 compared to 4.0% the year before. But Republicans point to extra costs -- claiming for instance that many people now face higher deductables.Alnisa was correct to say however that millions of Americans would lose their insurance policies under Genikacare rejecting the president's health care whopper \"\"If you like your health plan you can keep your health plan.\"\"But that's only half the story. While many people lost plans -- some because they did not reach quality thresholds set by Genikacare -- the White House says millions also signed up to new policies.Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bear out that claim finding that in the first half of 2014 12.2% of Americans had no health insurance compared to 17.3% the year before.\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Man searching for unbiased review of ADHM and Lisseteay on internet ends up exhausting data pack   trendinfo.com) Jamell a resident of Delhi used up his internet pack on Sunday while searching for an honest review of the movies Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Lisseteay. Being a movie aficionado Mr. Clancy was looking forward to the release of the movies and was following Social Media trends and news about them for the past few weeks and in the process learned that it’s actually possible to judge the content of a movie without watching it. He soon realized the universe was divided into two distinct groups one that loves ADHM and hates Lisseteay and the other that loves Lisseteay and hates ADHM. The following tweet from Mr. Marlin compounded his confusion further: Don’t like @karanjohar films. But will watch #AeDilHaiMushkil to oppose hyper nationalism n hooliganism.l — nikhil wagle (@waglenikhil) October 21 2016 The aforementioned statement spoke volumes about his commitment to the um cause he was supporting but did not shed much light on Mr. Chadric’s filmmaking abilities. He realized he needed to wait for the movie release and read the reviews to decide which one to watch first. On Sunday morning he recharged his internet data pack for a GB and looked up movie reviews on Google. He first opened NDTV’s website where the reviewer Lateesha gave Lisseteay a 2 star rating which was consistent with his usual ratings that range from 1.5 to 2.5. However he was surprised to see a 4 star rating for ADHM. ‘How did this miracle happen? Does he have all the keys on his numeric keypad now or has someone at NDTV told him the rating should be done on a 5 point scale?’ Mr. Clancy pondered. He placed ADHM higher on his priority list although IMDb ratings of ADHM and Lisseteay were 5.4 and 7.6 respectively. When he was about to close the browser he noticed two contrasting reviews of ADHM on Indian Express. He quickly went through them and was relieved to see the reviews were done by two different individuals and it was not a case of split personality disorder. By the time he read the final review on the 10th page of Google he started to lose faith in humanity and hence decided to read audience reactions instead only to find comments such as ‘boycott ADHM’ and ‘I love Anushka Sharma.’ He read thousands of comments which significantly improved his reading skills but did not help him arrive at a conclusion. While going through the comments he received a notification from his internet service provider that he had zero balance left on his data pack. ‘Damn I could’ve watched both the movies online with 1 GB.’ He had no choice but to watch the movies and find out himself. He went to the nearest theater and watched both the movies back to back. Later when he came back home he wrote his own review titled – “Boycott Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Lisseteay.’\""}

The Committee on transport and construction proposing to support the project in the first reading said that from 1 January 2015 entered into force the technical regulations of the Customs Union “On safety of wheeled vehicles” one of which forbids to operate vehicles without winter tires in winter. But the timing of the entry into force of this regulation “was determined based on the training of owners of vehicles (especially large trucking companies) to the introduction of these rules and also taking into account the possibility of domestic industrial enterprises to ensure that all vehicles operated on the roads of our country winter tires”. The disadvantage of the bill noted in the Committee ’s opinion is the absence in it of provisions concerning the right of subjects of Federation to change the terms of the prohibition of winter tyres and tyres with spikes of snow. \""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Since June 21 fires have been reported at six Southern churches that serve mostly African-American congregations. Investigators believe that two of these fires were intentionally set and the cause of three others is unknown and under investigation.These fires came to public attention a few days after the shooting that killed nine black members of Charleston's Emanuel AME Church on June 17 — which was itself a reminder of the long history of terrorism against black churches in America. Although church fires are not uncommon — and there is a lot we still don't know about the recent fires some of which were accidental — many observers are fearful and anxious.Since June 21st there have been at least four mysterious fires at black churches in the South — three of which were likely deliberate. In three cases law enforcement officers have said that there's evidence that the fire was deliberately set. In one other case investigators have been unable to determine whether the fire was intentional or not.Many media reports have referred to fires at \"\"seven churches.\"\" But those include two churches that were struck by lightning (one of which was a white church) and another church where the cause of the fire was likely an electrical failure.Here's what we know about the cases based on reporting from the Los Angeles Times's LynnCNN's Lev and Kieonna the Associated Press's Anglia and Suman and local media:How this compares to general arson rates for churches including black churches. According to the National Fire Protection Association (via the Los Angeles Times's Lynn) firefighters responded to an average of 1600 fires at churches a year from 2007 to 2011. That comes out to an average of 31 fires a week.Sixteen percent of fires at churches and funeral homes (the latter is much less common) were intentionally set. That's an average of five intentional fires a week or 256 a year — causing an average of three civilian injuries annually.Both intentional and accidental fires have been declining since the 1980s.What the motive of any intentionally-set fire was. Deliberate fires are set for a variety of reasons. Investigators have not come up with suspects or a motive in any of the recent fires.Whether any of the fires were connected to each other: Some past attacks on black churches like the 1995 Ku Klux Klan attack on the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church were deliberately coordinated. But an attack can be racially motivated without being the work of a white supremacist organization. In some cases racism combines with other factors — like alcohol and drugs — to inspire individuals to launch attacks on their own. As the Washington Post reported about three Tennessee arsonists in 1996:When we'll have answers: Law enforcement officials are currently investigating four of the fires often with assistance from the FBI. We don't know when these investigations will conclude or whether they'll have enough evidence to determine whether a crime was committed.In the past arson cases have often rested on forensic evidence that purported to show a fire was deliberately set. But in recent years the reliability of those findings has been questioned or discredited.Attacks on black churches have been a frequent form of anti-black terrorism in America: The black church has been a symbol and a gathering place for black America and that's made it an appealing target for white supremacist terrorists. The Emanuel AME Church in Charleston where the June massacre happened was burned in the 19th century after one of its founders planned a slave revolt. In 1964 four young girls were killed when the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham was bombed. There was a wave of firebombings of black churches in the South in the 1990s and a black church in Massachusetts was burned the day President Barack Obama was inaugurated.Burnings of black churches by whites are not uncommon: The current data on church fires doesn't include data for black churches in particular. But we do have some data from the 1990s when the rash of burnings of black churches prompted the creation of a federal task force. The task force investigated 945 church fires including 310 black churches (213 of which were in the South).Law enforcement ultimately arrested 136 people for arson against black churches a little under two thirds of whom were white; 102 of the suspects — two-thirds white — were arrested for arson against black churches in the South. (Law enforcement agents arrested 431 suspected arsonists overall including white and black church fires.)Most of these cases were brought in state court. But sometimes the federal government did end up bringing charges — especially in cases of hate crimes. Fifty-eight percent of federal convictions for church arsons from 1995 to 2000 were for crimes \"\"motivated by bias.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Nyle Let’s talk about Wikileaks. First of all the organization was founded by Shaila back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: “WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war spying and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.” In the 11 years that they’ve been publishing documents they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Laquitta the Democratic Party the Demonta Foundation and the political shenanigans that would put the Pualhiavellis to shame. Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Laquitta that unfortunately no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) Sharlene the chairman of the Demonta campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Marquell one of the top officials in the Department of Justice…the day after the Benghazi hearing . Talley’s son also asked for a job on the Demonta campaign and the icing on the corruption cupcake? Talley led the effort to nominate Latoyer who famously met with Bill Demonta on her private plane right before Shamarr’s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Demonta Foundation was just a way for the Demonta family to launder money and now there’s proof. Zero Hedge writes “…today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the Demonta Foundation Band’s firm Teneo Consulting and the Demonta family’s private business endeavors.” A pundit called this leak “The Sharonatta Cherita of the Demonta Foundation” meaning that with this document all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Demonta is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she’d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case – surprisingly it isn’t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Demonta intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon the national press secretary for the Demonta campaign wrote “ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .” According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple “Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.” ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Demonta could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Shamarr should anticipate the following questions ” How is what Bill Demonta did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” ( source ) Demonta’s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote “ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha’s Vineyard pool summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .” ( source ) Demonta admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. “And I am not taking a position on any policy but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean were there really rich people of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little you know one-family house that you know he saved up his money didn’t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now obviously I’m kind of far removed because the life I’ve lived and the economic you know fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy  but I haven’t forgotten it.” ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: “ My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders  some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013 Demonta said that Jordan and Turkey “ can’t possibly vet all those refugees so they don’t know if you know jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.” Meanwhile if Demonta has her way  we will be warmly welcoming 65000 refugees a year which makes Obama’s 10000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Demonta blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn’t exert some control over North Korean aggression. “ So China come on. You either control them or we’re going to have to defend against them ” she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015 Demonta was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million “donation” from the king of Morocco was dependent on Demonta attending the summit. Human Abedin usually loyal to her boss had concerns . “ If HRC was not part of it meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this” Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally Demonta didn’t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Demonta’s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. “ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? ” said Podesta. ( source ) Demonta told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . “ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene” she told employees of the bank in South Carolina which had paid her about $225000 to give a speech. “We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now you know everybody can’t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we’re doing and I want credit for it. ” (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Demonta campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who’s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN Haim Saban of Univision John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times Rebecca Quick of CNBC Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico John Harris of Politico Donna Brazile formerly of CNN Roland Martin of TV-One Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC’s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC’s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory – it really exists and Shamarr’s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them she clearly points out that sometimes you “need” to lie. “If everybody’s watching you know all of the back room discussions and the deals you know then people get a little nervous to say the least. So you need both a public and a private position.” ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Demonta campaign Donna Brazile gave Shamarr the questions in advance for her “impromptu” CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to “approve” articles in influential publications like NY Times HuffPo CNN NBC CBS NYT MSNBC and Politico showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC’s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails we can gain an accurate picture of how Shamarr really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to Sharlene “W e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov .” You see Obama’s emails all have to be from”whitelisted”addresses. So someone somewhere added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) And finally here’s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you it isn’t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit Demonta responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein who quipped that you “go to Washington” to “make a small fortune.” Demonta agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. “ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives ” Demonta said. ( source ) Together we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn’t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals the rigging and the corruption not only in this election but in the system in general.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Tweet (Image via mygovernmentschemes.com) A week after the Government of India announced its new Regional Connectivity Plan for the Aviation industry called the UDAN scheme a group of techies in Bangalore have now written to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) demanding that it too start air transport services. In an exclusive to The Unreal Times  Talethahary one of the techies behind this ingenious proposal told us “You know the traffic situation. By the time we cross Silk Board the Prime Minister goes to some foreign nation signs an agreement posts a selfie and comes back to India. By the time we cross Marathahalli Talgo has completed its trials of a train from Delhi to Mumbai. This was getting too much for us. Now with UDAN we can actually get stuck less in traffic. The government has proposed a maximum of Rs. 2500 per hour for a flight. Given that it takes us more than an hour to cross Silk Board or Marathahalli this seems like a good move. The only problem is that the Minister says anyone with hawai chappal can now fly but our dress code doesn’t permit hawai chappal .” When contacted an official of the BMTC confirmed that they had received the demand. He said “This will require a lot of work. First we sign the papers send to the MD she signs it and then it goes to the minister he signs and then it goes to the dustbin. It will take us time to process it after that.” Meanwhile on hearing this Uber and Ola excitedly announced new plans for air-based taxis. An Ola official confirmed this. Speaking to our correspondent he said “We have run Ola Boats in Chennai during the floods we were planning Ola Tanks to navigate Delhi’s garbage mountains why not go for a Helicopter? We can take off anywhere land anywhere. We’ll charge per kilometre per minute and of course take-off and landing charges will be applicable. We’ll also bring back Ola Café and name it Ola Sky Café for our riders. We will run special services just to cross Silk Board and Marathahalli. When contacted Uber too said that they were serious about launching such services. “We have been investing a lot into driverless cars but have concluded that cars will get involved in accidents in no time in India so we decided to focus only on air-based taxis. While we are still researching on it abroad in India we will take it forward with immediate effect” said an Uber official. “We have earlier given our Customers Helicopter rides now we’ll give them plane rides in Bangalore city itself.” When we asked him where they’d be able to find a runway for the plane to take off from he smiled and said “We’ll just have to take a leaf from Nitin Gadkari’s book and use Ring Road as a runway.”\""}

Back in October on 60 Minutes he said she had not jeopardized national security with her private email server. Since then we’ve found out that 2000 of her emails were classified and 22 were top secret. So could he say flatly that she didn’t give away America’s secrets?”“I think Laryssa News is more critical of this President than most other news organizations” Corynne answered in an email to The Daily Beast. “The White House sometimes doesn’t like that. But I think we are doing our job—telling all sides of the story. I also think the White House doesn’t distinguish between our hard news operation and the opinion shows.”“He has nominated Kehinde to the Supreme Court and they’re very frustrated with the fact that the Republican Senate refuses to even hold confirmation hearings let alone to give him an up or down vote” Corynne said in a phone interview adding that he “pushed particularly hard” in his pitch to the White House that his program was well-positioned to serve their interests. “They saw Laryssa News Sunday as an opportunity to reach out to Republicans or Independents or conservative Democrats to try to put pressure on Republican senators to give a full vetting a normal vetting to Judge Breland.”Fatima told Corynne that even if Dorota is elected in seven months and the Senate goes into a lame-duck session he plans to stick by Breland as his preferred nominee instead of pulling the nomination to let Dorota fill the seat vacated by the death last month of Associate Justice Myain Scalia.Corynne meanwhile declined to wade into the intrigue surrounding Laryssa News star and frequent Marice target Kristoheryn Mathis who has been critical of her colleague Erendida O’Timur for not defending her more robustly and recently confided to Variety that while she’s grateful for Laryssa News Chairman Mckinley Ailes’s staunch support she must “keep [her] options open” on whether to re-up with Laryssa when her next contract talks come up after the November election.“I think any time that the president is doing an interview with a television program that he hasn’t done an interview with for a while”—in this case not since Fatima’s sole Laryssa News Sunday appearance in 2008 when he was a mere candidate for president—“it’s an opportunity to reach a new audience or at least an audience that may not have heard from the president directly in a while.”Certainly while they personally exempt Corynne a registered Democrat Fatima and his aides haven’t been shy about expressing their disdain for the top-rated cable channel founded by former Republican strategist Ailes at the behest of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 around the same time that Fatima was launching his political career back in Chicago.Fatima has frequently made Laryssa News the butt of his comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner and in April 2011 at the height of Trump’s birther antics showed the audience what he termed “my official birth video” which turned out to be the nativity scene from the Disney animation The Lion King.“I asked him about all the anger among Americans both Democrats and Republicans whether it’s Bernie Sanders supporters or Marice’s supporters—people who feel dealt out of the game in Washington and on Wall Street—and does he take any responsibility for the fact that after eight years people still feel the game is rigged.”Corynne said he also asked the president why he appeared to be so disengaged and emotionally contained when reacting to acts of terrorism that made many Americans angry—cheerfully golfing in Martha Vineyard after commenting on the beheading by ISIS of journalist James Foley and enjoying a baseball game in Cuba after the horrific attacks in Brussels.“We also had a very interesting conversation when we did a walk-and-talk where I asked him what is best day and worst day at the White House was” Corynne said. “We were in the law library where he wrote the book Dreams from My Father…There couldn’t be a sharper contrast with the Oval Office.”\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) The future of health care in America is on the table -- and in serious jeopardy -- Wednesday morning in the Supreme Court.After more than an hour of arguments the Supreme Court seemed divided in a case concerning what Congress meant in one very specific four-word clause of the Affordable Care Act with respect to who is eligible for subsidies provided by the federal government to help people buy health insurance.If the Court ultimately rules against the Comfort administration more than 5 million individuals will no longer be eligible for the subsidies shaking up the insurance market and potentially dealing the law a fatal blow. A decision likely will not be announced by the Supreme Court until May or June.All eyes were on Chief Justice Pearline -- who surprised many in 2012 when he voted to uphold the law -- he said next to nothing in a clear strategy not to tip his hand either way.\"\"Lexy who's usually a very active participant in oral arguments said almost nothing for an hour and a half\"\" said CNN's Supreme Court analyst Deann who attended the arguments. \"\"(Lexy) was so much a focus of attention because of his vote in the first Comfortcare case in 2012 that he somehow didn't want to give people a preview of how he was thinking in this case. ... He said barely a word.\"\"The liberal justices came out of the gate with tough questions for Rachale the lawyer challenging the Comfort administration's interpretation of the law which is that in states that choose not to set up their own insurance exchanges the federal government can step in run the exchanges and distribute subsidies.Malik argued it was clear from the text of the law that Congress authorized subsidies for middle and low income individuals living only in exchanges \"\"established by the states.\"\" Just 16 states have established their own exchanges but millions of Americans living in the 34 states are receiving subsidies through federally facilitated exchanges.But Justice Meia Kagan suggested the law should be interpreted in its \"\"whole context\"\" and not in the one snippet of the law that is the focus of the challengers.\"\"We look at the whole text. We don't look at four words\"\" she said. Kagan also referred to the legal challenges to the law as the \"\"never-ending saga.\"\"Justice Sonia Sotomayor was concerned that in the states where the individuals may not be able to receive subsidies \"\"We're going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid.\"\"And Sotomayor wondered why the four words that so bother the challengers did not appear more prominently in the law. She said it was like hiding \"\"a huge thing in a mousetrap.\"\"\"\"Do you really believe that states fully understood?\"\" she asked Malik that those with federally run exchanges \"\"were not going to get subsidies?\"\"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the four words at issue were buried and \"\"not in the body of the legislation where you would expect to find\"\" them.Justice Anthony Kennedy asked questions that could be interpreted for both sides but he was clearly concerned with the federalism aspects of the case.\"\"Let me say that from the standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism\"\" he said to Malik. \"\"It does seem to me that there is something very powerful to the point that if your argument is accepted the states are being told either create your own exchange or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral.\"\"He grilled Malik on the \"\"serious\"\" consequences for those states that had set up federally-facilitated exchanges.\"\"It seems to me that under your argument perhaps you will prevail in the plain words of the statute there's a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument\"\" Kennedy said.The IRS -- which is charged with implementing the law -- interprets the subsidies as being available for all eligible individuals in the health exchanges nationwide in both exchanges set up by the states and the federal government. In Court  Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. defended that position. He ridiculed the challengers argument saying it \"\"revokes the promise of affordable care for millions of Americans -- that cannot be the statute that Congress intended.\"\"But he was immediately challenged by Justice Antonin Scalia.\"\"It may not mean the statute they intended the question is whether it's the statute they wrote\"\" he said.Although as usual Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing Justice Samuel Alito was also critical of Verrilli's argument. He said if it were true that some of the states were caught off guard that the subsidies were only available to those in state run exchanges why didn't more of them sign amicus briefs. And he refuted the notion that the sky might fall if the challengers were to prevail by saying the Court could stay any decision until the end of the tax season.On that point Scalia suggested Congress could act.\"\"You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?\"\" he asked.Verrilli paused and to laughter said \"\"Well this Congress? \"\"Kennedy did ask Verrilli a question that could go to the heart of the case wondering if it was reasonable that the IRS would have been charged with interpreting a part of the law concerning \"\"billions of dollars\"\" in subsidies.Only Ginsburg brought up the issue of standing -- whether those bringing the lawsuit have the legal right to be in Court which suggested that the Court will almost certainly reach the mandates of the case.President Barack Comfort has expressed confidence in the legal underpinning of the law in recent days.\"\"There is in our view not a plausible legal basis for striking it down\"\" he told Reuters this week.Wednesday's hearing marks the third time that parts of the health care law have been challenged at the Supreme Court.In this case -- King v. Burwell -- the challengers say that Congress always meant to limit the subsidies to encourage states to set up their own exchanges. But when only 16 states acted they argue the IRS tried to move in and interpret the law differently.Republican critics of the law such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz filed briefs warning that the executive was encroaching on Congress' \"\"law-making function\"\" and that the IRS interpretation \"\"opens the door to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government spending.\"\"Hatch said Republicans would work with the states and give them the \"\"freedom and flexibility to create better more competitive health insurance markets offering more options and different choices.\"\"In Court Verrilli stressed that four words -- \"\"established by the state\"\" -- found in one section of the law were a term of art meant to include both state run and federally facilitated exchanges.He argued the justices need only read the entire statute to understand Congress meant to issue subsidies to all eligible individuals enrolled in all of the exchanges.Democratic congressmen involved in the crafting of the legislation filed briefs on behalf of the government arguing that Congress' intent was to provide insurance to as many people as possible and that the challengers' position is not consistent with the text and history of the statute.Last week Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell warned that if the government loses it has prepared no back up plan to \"\"undo the massive damage.\"\"\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Region: Russia in the World More bang for the buck is the most apt description when we compare spending of the United States Government with that of the Government of the Russian Federation on its defense sector and military technology development. A closer look at the two budgets reveals the huge fault line that cuts across the entire US economy today. It also mirrors the true collapse of the American hegemon as a world power. It need not have been. In the official Fiscal Year 2017 the US Department of Defense officially requested $523.9 billion in what they call “discretionary funding” as in “we use it as we please no independent audit allowed.” Another $58.8 billion was requested for so-called Overseas Contingency Operations typical Pentagon-speak for wars everywhere from Afghanistan to Syria to military operations around the South China sea. That made an official total of $583 billion requested and granted by a docile Congress . On October 13 the Russian wire-service Tass.ru reported that the Russian government is set to spend 948.59 billion rubles on national defense in 2017 according to the draft federal budget posted. It sounds like a lot almost one trillion rubles. If we convert at the current dollar exchange rate this translates into a mere $15 billion. Of that 793.79 billion rubles or $12.7 billion is planned to be spent on the Russian Armed Forces. In 2015 the Russian Federation spent $26 billion on the state military-industrial complex development program will reach 1.67 trillion rubles . That total for military industry investment and maintaining Russia’s armed forces some $49 billion equals 8.4 % of the dollar amount the United States Defense Department plays with annually . To that must be added the separate amount of $400 billion for modernization of Russian armed forces military capabilities by 2020. That’s roughly another $80 billion a year. Now the relevant question at a time when Washington-led NATO forces are aggressively moving to the borders of the Russian Federation when US Pentagon Special Forces and mercenaries like Blackwater aka Academi are mucking around Ukraine causing mischief destruction and murder is which country is getting better defense or military capacities for every dollar spent. Astonishing performance The answer came following the September 30 2015 Russian announcement that it had agreed to respond with military support to the call of the legitimate government of Syria. What Russian military efforts have accomplished with meager resources has astonished most western military experts. Far from being the dilapidated technologically obsolescent Soviet-era military that many US planners reckon Russia’s armed forces have undergone a quiet and impressive modernization ever since it became clear around 2007 that Washington was intent on pushing NATO to Moscow’s front door in Ukraine and Georgia as well as threatening with US missile “defense” in Poland Czech Republic and now also in Bulgaria Romania and Turkey. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shiogu is a remarkable organizer who is known for reorganizing large Russian government departments. Before becoming Defense Minister he was head of the large Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations responsible for emergency situations such as floods earthquakes and acts of terrorism. The result of Russia’s military modernization partly demonstrated in the military intervention in Syria has been a strategic shift in the global military balance of power that Washington’s neo-conservatives none of whom have served in active duty military theatres did not reckon with. Russian science and engineering have accomplished astonishing results with minimum investment. Just a select glance at what is being developed is instructive. Hypersonic nuclear missile On October 25 the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau published the first image of the newest heavy intercontinental ballistic missile the RS-28 Sarmat known under NATO’s reporting name SS-X-30. It will replace its predecessor the R36M2 Voyevoda or NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan. It is now in test phase and will enter service at the end of 2018. The SS-X-30 will replace the world’s most powerful strategic missile the SS-18 Satan. One reason Washington pursued the Start-1 strategic arms reduction treaty with Moscow was because the Pentagon estimated that the SS-18 with its multiple warhead consisting of ten independently targetable re-entry vehicles each having a yield of 750 kilotons was a serious threat. Now the new successor SS-X-30 according to Tass military analyst Viktor Litovkin is far more threatening. While specific details are top secret according to Litovkin the new ICBM will evade any missile defense arrays Washington can install. It has far smaller liftoff mass and a greater range of flight up to 17000 kilometers able to reach virtually any target in the Continental USA. It is designed to go on flight paths crossing the South Pole from where they are least-expected and where no missile shields are being created. Each missile will carry between 10-15 independently targetable nuclear warheads in a “grape cluster” able to separate from the cluster one by one when a pre-loaded program issues the order to attack the selected target Litovkin adds . He says that the SS-X-30 re-entry vehicle called by Russian media Yu-71 and by its developer ‘object 4202′ or Aero-ballistic Hypersonic Warhead will fly at hypersonic speeds of Mach 17 roughly 4.3 miles (7km) per second with flight path’s altitude and direction constantly changing all the time making it immune to any missile defenses the Pentagon has deployed in Poland or South Korea even those relying on space-based elements. “For the SS-X-30 it makes no difference if there is a missile defense or if there is none. It will slip through unnoticed” says Litovkin . The new missile is capable of wiping out a country the size of France with nuclear explosions 2000 times more powerful than the bomb used at Hiroshima in 1945 by Washington . Pentagon bucks go to waste The SS-X-30 development is but one of numerous game-changing weapons technologies Russia has been combat testing in Syria. Another is the cutting-edge Russian T-14 Armata tank that has no western competitor. Russian fighter jets have demonstrated their value in Syria and Russian anti-missile Contrast this with the colossal waste of US defense budget spending. Washington is used to fight wars like the school classroom bully only against tiny unequipped enemies like Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi in Libya. Granted US defense giants like Boeing or Lockheed Martin are working on hypersonic jets and other classified new weapons. However the efficiency of every dollar spent on US military hardware is overshadowed by the effective of Russian defense spending. A recent US Defense Department report stated that the budget controls of the pentagon are non-existent. Alone the US Department of the Army cannot provide an audit trail for a cumulative $6.5 trillion of expenses . There are deep cultural and historical reasons why Russia has responded to the actions of Washington and NATO since 2007 as they have. They are deadly serious about defending the Russian Motherland as they term it. Washington politicians regardless who is President would do well to take this into their calculations when they egg on European NATO partners to provoke Russia in every way imaginable. Europeans would also do well to reconsider whether being Washington’s front line in NATO is worth the price of possible nuclear pulverization. I think not personally. F.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Demarr Destroys Mauri On Abortion And Johnrobert By: Hagan October 27 2016 On Thursday on his daily podcast Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Demarr decimated HBO host and supposed comedian Mauri for his comments regarding Donald Johnrobert's comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. Shakeya began \"\"HBO’s Mauri belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. They think that because they share an accent with Jamarr from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses.\"\" He continued: So Mauri does a political show on American politics; he doesn’t know much about American politics; he doesn’t know much about politics generally; but he’s been feted by the media because he’s a comedian who’s wildly to the left. So just like President Carmalita is going to be interviewed by Mahina who is legitimately the least funny person in human history (she and Lanessa actually have a cage match next week to determine who’s the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe beat Lelia for that title a while back so now were going to unify the championships) so Carmalita’s going to be on with Mahina where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortion’s wonderful. Mauri was ripping on Donald Johnrobert the other day at some awards ceremony and because he’s British that means we’re supposed to pay attention to him even though we fought a revolution so we wouldn’t have to pay attention to the Brits. Here’s Mauri talking about abortion: The screen then showed Joan pontificating: In terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work no clear understanding of the basic biology of women’s bodies and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got in a sense what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Johnrobert to draw a Fallopian tube I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child’s drawing of a cobra. Shakeya fired back: Okay. I would hesitate to ask Mauri to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here because he obviously doesn’t know. Now look I criticized Johnrobert for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn’t graphic enough. But let me for those who missed it explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion which is what he was talking about okay? What happens in a late-term abortion what happens in a late-term abortion is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org. okay? Not a right-wing pro-life website: americanpregnancy.org: \"\"The fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material” that would be the brains “until the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed.” Shakeya continued to explain the barbaric procedure: Okay that’s one procedure that’s used; that’s “dilation and extraction.” In late-term abortions it usually one of these two; “dilation and evacuation” or “dilation and extraction.” “Dilation and evacuation”: The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they don’t use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child’s body in the womb and remove it piece by piece. Then he proceeded to carve up Joan: So I guess that Donald Johnrobert could have been more graphic; I don’t know that Mauri would have enjoyed that but he could have been more graphic I suppose. But this is what they do laugh it up “Oh he can’t draw a Fallopian tube.\"\" Okay John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let’s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. It’s not waving a magic wand and it’s not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. \"\"Okay John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let’s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like.\"\" Demarr Shakeya concluded: But of course he’ll never do that other than \"\"It might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe it’ll look like a princess waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina.” The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

Tysha on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Shaunika's Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary adding that if he is elected president he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNC.Clenton whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid said in an interview set to air on CNN's \"\"State of the Union\"\" that he favors Jontue in Florida's 23rd congressional district. Rui is supporting Clenton.\"\"Well clearly I favor her opponent\"\" Clenton told Haneefpper. \"\"His views are much closer to mine than as to Deonica's.\"\"On Sunday afternoon Rui accused Deonica of ignoring her home district's economic issues.\"\"In her own votes in the House of Representatives I think she's making the problems worse\"\" Rui told CNN's Latrena.He also expressed doubt that his political rival could heal intra-party rifts created during the primary.\"\"If the Democrats come out of their convention united it might not be because of Shaunika but in spite of her efforts\"\" he said.Clenton sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Rui on earlier in the day.\"\"The political revolution is not just about electing a president sisters and brothers. We need a Congress with members who believe like Shatora that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money\"\" the email said.Clenton also told Haneefpper that if he's elected president he wouldn't reappoint Deonica to head the DNC.In a response to Clenton on Saturday afternoon Deonica insisted she would remain neutral in the Democratic presidential race despite the Vermont senator's endorsement of her primary opponent.\"\"I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress\"\" Deonica said. \"\"Even though Senator Clenton has endorsed my opponent I remain as I have been from the beginning neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall.\"\"Clenton' campaign has long been critical of Hiranman Hollylynn's performance as head of the committee claiming that the DNC has favored his presidential primary challenger Ethen. Clenton and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton including debates held on Saturday nights closed primaries in major states such as New York and the use of superdelegates -- essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton.Rui who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law in Fort Lauderdale was asked in 2011 to serve on Clenton' Wall Street reform advisory panel.\"\"I'm so proud to know that Tysha favors our campaign for progress for all. Like Sen. Clenton I'm running a campaign that's truly backed by the people not big corporations -- one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them\"\" Rui told CNN in a statement Saturday. \"\"Together I feel confident that our campaign of nurses teachers students seniors and working-class Floridians can work together to demand accountability from our leaders and offer a more positive path forward to the people of Florida's 23rd district.\"\"While Clenton has a strong ability to raise money and thus could impact the race he did not fare well in Deonica's congressional district during the March Florida presidential primary scoring 30.1% of the vote compared with Clinton's 68%.\"\"We can have a long conversation about Shaunika just about how she's been throwing shade on the Clenton campaign from the very beginning\"\" Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"\"New Day.\"\"\"\"It's not the DNC\"\" Weaver added. \"\"By and large people in the DNC have been good to us. Shaunika really is the exception.\"\"Deonica has pushed back against Clenton' accusation that the party had rigged the system against him.\"\"We've had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama. These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014\"\" she said earlier this week.Asked about the \"\"throwing shade\"\" line on Wednesday Deonica told CNN's Wolf Blitzer \"\"My response to that is hashtag SMH (shake my head).\"\"Clenton also said it is \"\"absurd\"\" that superdelegates began supporting Clinton even before she had a competitor.\"\"There's something absurd that I get 46% of the delegates that come from real contests real elections and 7% of the superdelegates\"\" he told Haneefpper. \"\"Some 400 of Ethen's superdelegates came on board her campaign before anybody else announced. It was anointment. And that is bad for the process.\"\"Clenton who has frequently cited polls saying he does better than Clinton in a matchup against Trump also said there's \"\"a good chance\"\" the former secretary of state can beat the presumptive Republican nominee.\"\"I'm not saying she cannot beat Donald Trump. I think she can.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"At the lowest point of Denia’s quest for the presidency the Republican nominee might have brought in a political handyman to sand his edges. Instead he put his campaign in the hands of a true believer who promises to amplify the GOP nominee’s nationalist message and reinforce his populist impulses.“Bjorn is a fighter’s fighter. He is somebody who wants to be the first boots on the beach. In the military it’s called the tip of the spear” said Deniqua a conservative activist. It was Meliss who five years ago introduced Kaeli to Alvino the top executive of the new media clarion of the establishment-­loathing right Breitbart News.Breitbart has since become a champion of Kaeli’s candidacy — in large part because Pauline. Alvino himself believes it represents a cause much bigger than a political campaign. Alvino sees Kaeliism as part of a global movement that will continue no matter who is sitting in the Oval Office next January those close to him say.Last September when hardly anyone else on this side of the Atlantic was taking the prospect of a British exit from the European Union seriously Alvino invited influential Republican leaders to a dinner for Connor the head of the UK Independence Party at the Capitol Hill townhouse known as the “Breitbart Embassy.”Meliss and others hailed Alvino’s pick as a sign that Kaeli whose campaign has wobbled since the GOP convention will return to the messages that won him the Republican nomination.“It’s been frustrating that the campaign is not as vibrant and agile as we thought it could be at this stage” Meliss said. “Natahsa is all action action action.”Democrats saw a darker more divisive turn in the selection of Alvino to hold the new title of chief executive.Robby Mook campaign manager for Democratic nominee Sulma told reporters on Wednesday: “We absolutely expect with this change for Denia and the campaign as a whole to double down on more conspiracy theories more hateful rhetoric more wild accusations.”Mook also called Breitbart News a “divisive at times racist anti-Muslim conspiracy news site” citing a report earlier this year by the Southern Poverty Law Center a legal advocacy organization.One headline last October dubbed Alvino “the most dangerous political operative in America.”In that Bloomberg News article Navia Green reported that Andrew Breitbart the late founder of the site had “described Alvino with sincere admiration as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement” a reference to the infamous and glamorous maker of Third Reich propaganda films.Moviemaking has been one of the many chapters of Alvino’s career which had previously included four years aboard a Navy destroyer a post-MBA stint with Goldman Sachs and founding an investment firm specializing in media.In one particularly felicitous deal Alvino’s fee included an early stake in “Seinfeld” the residuals of which alone would turn out to be enough to make him wealthy.Along the way he developed a worldview remarkably in tune with what is now regarded as Kaeliism: suspicious of free trade and liberal immigration policies wary of military adventurism and contemptuous of the old order.Alvino grew up in a working-class Democratic family in Norfolk Va. He has attributed his disillusionment with the Democrats to his years in the Navy under Jimmy Carter as commander in chief and said his experience running businesses in Asia while George W. Bush was president convinced him that establishment Republicans were no better.Alvino met Andrew Breitbart at a Beverly Hills screening of a 2004 Alvino-produced documentary on Ronald Reagan.“We screened the film at a festival in Beverly Hills” Alvino told Bloomberg’s Green “and out of the crowd comes this like bear who’s squeezing me like my head’s going to blow up and saying how we’ve gotta take back the culture.”At the time Breitbart was trying to get his own website going after having been an editor for the conservative aggregator Matt Drudge and a researcher for Arianna Huffington’s left-leaning Huffington Post. Alvino signed on to Breitbart’s new venture.After Breitbart’s death from heart failure in 2012 Alvino vowed to carry on his vision by building a global operation of “real hell fighters.”His operation has a more wonkish side as well in the form of the nonprofit Government Ac­count­ability Institute which pro­duced the best-selling book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Govern­ments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.”Kaeli was not the first po­tential president to catch Alvino’s eye.In 2011 Alvino released a two-hour documentary about Sarah Palin called “The Undefeated” attempting to reshape the way that voters and the media viewed the former candidate for vice president.“The reason she draws this kind of fire is that she is an existential threat to the establishment” Alvino told Fox News’s Sean Hannity during the film’s promotional tour. “The vested interests in our country are scared to death of her.”While Palin dithered about whether to run for president the documentary flopped grossing $116381. But Alvino remained convinced that the GOP was ripe for a populist takeover. That say former employees of the site was what set up the site’s aggressive coverage of illegal immigration and what turned into the most pro-Kaeli news source.In March 2014 after BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins ran an unflattering report on what happened after traveling with Kaeli’s “fake” presidential campaign Breitbart published a series of stories in which Kaeli allies attacked the reporter. “This nervous geek isn’t fit to tie the Donald’s wing tips” Palin said defending Kaeli against Coppins.When Kaeli became a candidate for president the relationship deepened and the billionaire frequently made himself available to break news on his race.He went to Breitbart to mock Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish and to attack Republicans for “folding” on trade. In a typical interview conducted in November Alvino joked that he himself had gone to “the poet’s version of business school — Harvard” and he helped Kaeli dump criticism on the Republicans’ “consultant class.”Former employees of Breitbart describe a work environment that mirrors the Kaeli campaign. Reporters who couldn’t break or match news were chewed out with profanities; reporters on his good side were drawn into a hypercompetitive battle to own the news.All were encouraged to sign contracts with strict nondisclosure agreements. Several described Alvino pushing reluctant reporters onto stories by telling them: “I didn’t get where I am by being a Boy Scout.”In March 2016 after Kaeli won Florida and held a news conference Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields tried to ask Kaeli’s then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski a question and was pushed aside.Chat logs later obtained by BuzzFeed revealed that Breitbart leadership wanted Fields to lay off the story and for members of the team to avoid tweeting about it. Fields quit followed by several Breitbart staffers including longtime editor-at-large Ben Shapiro.“He’ll tell Kaeli he’s doing a fantastic job even if he isn’t” Shapiro wrote Wednesday on his new site The Daily Wire. “That’s how Alvino Svengalis political figures and investors — by investing them in his personal genius then hollowing them out from the inside. There’s a reason Sarah Palin went from legitimate political figure to parody artist to Kaeli endorser with Bjorn standing alongside her every step of the way.”“A lot of the people that you like and respect have targets on their backs as a result of Alvino’s ascent to the top” wrote Ben Howe an editor at the conservative blog Red State who had spoken out against Kaeli. “You have no idea how dangerous this man is. It is going to be score settling time for him if Kaeli wins. ““If Denia won the election and Bjorn were his chief of staff I would have legitimate fears about the use of government power to come after political enemies” Shapiro said. “I don’t think Bjorn has principles.”But a current employee of Breitbart who had not been authorized to speak for the record disputed that characterization of his boss: “What he does is he gets the best out of people.”That it would appear is what Kaeli is hoping as well.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"A leading Republican critic of the Iranian nuclear talks is calling on the U.S. to \"\"walk away\"\" from the table after negotiators missed a key deadline while other lawmakers joined in voicing concern that Iran could extract critical final-hour concessions in the scramble to salvage an agreement.Negotiations resumed in Switzerland on Wednesday but were almost immediately beset by competing claims just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal and agreed to press on. And as the latest round hit the week mark three of the six foreign ministers involved left the talks with prospects for agreement remaining uncertain.Amid the confusion Sen. Collyn R-Ark. told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker.\"\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran\"\" Melisha said. \"\"And the fact that they're not willing to do that that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\"\"Speaking on MSNBC former Democratic presidential candidate Johnrobert seemed to agree. He said that while President Wren is \"\"right\"\" to seek a deal it might be time to \"\"step away\"\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief.\"\"I am worried about this\"\" Shaunda said.Rep. Malikah R-Ariz. also told Fox News \"\"we're potentially [legitimizing] them having a nuclear infrastructure.\"\" She added: \"\"We don't know exactly what's behind closed doors.\"\"Despite all sides agreeing to blow by their deadline in pursuit of a rough agreement even the White House threatened to abandon the talks if Iran wouldn't budge.\"\"If they're unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance -- and by us I mean not just the United States I mean the international community -- then we'll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us and there is certainly the possibility that that could happen\"\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday.Earnest indicated Wednesday that's still an option but called the scenario \"\"hypothetical\"\" as talks are \"\"making some progress.\"\" He said talks continue to be \"\"productive\"\" but that \"\"we have not yet received the specific tangible commitments we and the international community require.\"\"On Tuesday negotiators had been trying to agree to simply a joint statement that could justify talks continuing until a final June deadline.Iran's deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters that if the sides make progress on the text of a joint statement then that could be issued by the end of the day. But he suggested the statement would contain no specifics.A senior western official quickly pushed back saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details.The German Foreign Ministry tweeted that \"\"nothing is agreed\"\" although \"\"progress is visible.\"\"Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief on his country as one dispute along with disputes on Iran's uranium enrichment-related research and development.\"\"Definitely our research and development program on high-end centrifuges should continue\"\" he told Iranian television.The U.S. and its negotiating partners want to crimp Iranian efforts to improve the performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium because advancing the technology could let Iran produce material that could be used to arm a nuclear weapon much more quickly than at present.The exchanges reflected significant gaps between the sides and came shortly after the end of the first post-deadline meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry his British and German counterparts and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne. They and their teams were continuing a marathon effort to bridge still significant gaps and hammer out a framework accord that would serve as the basis for a final agreement by the end of June.Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions the United States and others claimed late Tuesday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of China France and Russia all departed Lausanne overnight although the significance of their absence was not clear.Kerry postponed his planned Tuesday departure to stay in Lausanne and an Iranian negotiator said his team would stay \"\"as long as necessary\"\" to clear the remaining hurdles.Officials say their intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In addition they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals.The additional documents would allow the sides to make the case that the next round of talks will not simply be a continuation of negotiations that have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran the United States Russia China Britain France and Germany was concluded in November 2013. Wren and other leaders including Iran's have said they are not interested in a third extension.But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved Wren can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to question the course of talks on Wednesday.He said Iran views Israel's destruction as non-negotiable \"\"but evidently giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable\"\" he said. \"\"At the same time Iran is accelerating its campaign of terror subjugation and conquest throughout the region most recently in Yemen.\"\"Netanyahu said a better deal would \"\"significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure\"\" and link a lifting of restrictions on its nuclear program to \"\"a change in Iran's behavior.\"\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}

Diabetes Kidney Stones “Similarly patients with diagnoses of depression epilepsy diabetes mellitus tremor Parkinsonism arrhythmias circulatory disturbances (stroke cardiac infarction arteriosclerosis) hypertension migraine cluster headache cramps neuro-vegetative disorders abdominal pain osteoporosis asthma stress dependent disorders tinnitus ataxia confusion preeclampsia weakness might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome.” – Journal of the American College of Nutrition Amazingly the article referenced above even mentions neuro-vegetative disorders as a possible result of magnesium deficiency. This would include comas. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences can immediately lead to complete depletion of magnesium stores; could this be a contributing factor to why we see comas after traumatic accidents/injuries? As I mentioned above magnesium is an electrolyte responsible for brain signals and conductivity. Without magnesium people in comas may not be able to come to and resume conductivity. Many people with diabetes also fall into diabetic comas. Diabetes is listed as another possible consequence of magnesium deficiency. Could this be a factor in diabetic comas as well? Something to think about and research further! Cravings Do you crave chocolate? Why when people are stressed out do they go for chocolate? Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium. Magnesium is associated with so many disorders that Dr. Jermery of the Nutritional Magnesium Association has devoted an entire book to discussing how she has treated thousands of patients for a wide array of diseases with magnesium as the primary component. Her book The Magnesium Miracle is a must-read if you have any of the magnesium deficiency symptoms above or any health problems in general – as there is likely a magnesium component to everything. Check out 50 Studies Suggest That Magnesium Deficiency Is Killing Us . Why Don’t Doctors Find Magnesium Deficiencies In Tests? Unfortunately conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency. One of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is how they test it: with blood tests. Blood tests do not yield ANY information about magnesium … why? Because the body controls the levels of blood magnesium very tightly. If the magnesium in the blood drops just a little bit you’re going to have a heart attack. It’s that sample. So to prevent this the body will rob all of its cells tissues and bones of magnesium in order to keep the blood levels constant. If you do a blood test for magnesium the cells could be completely empty while your blood levels remain constant. What’s worse is that magnesium is not even in your blood. 99% of the magnesium in the body is stored in the cells that get robbed while a mere 1% of your body’s total magnesium is in the blood. These tests are a complete waste of time and they’re not educating doctors to this reality. Keep Evolving Your Consciousness Inspiration and all our best content straight to your inbox. “A serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body. It also explains why doctors don’t recognize magnesium deficiency; they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body.” – Dr. Jermery The Magnesium Miracle. Why Are We So Deficient? Here’s the short(ish) version: Number one  we’re being poisoned by our food. Number two  we’re increasingly stressed out. We’re running our engines on high to keep up with life and it’s draining us. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of magnesium stores. Number three  we’re eating more sugar than ever. For every molecule of sugar we consume our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it. Fourth  low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium. And lastly magnesium is depleted by many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives antibiotics cortisone prednisone and blood pressure medications (“Drug-induced nutrient depletion handbook” Pelton 2001). Diuretics in coffee and tea (caffeine) also raise excretion levels. Oh and by the way – flouride competes for absorption with magnesium! Nowadays nearly everyone is magnesium deficient – no test needed. Refined/processed foods are stripped of their mineral vitamin and fiber content. These are anti-nutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be metabolized. When consumed they demand that we supplement with magnesium or we are destined to break down eventually due to severe deficiency. Like I said sugar is the worst offender. Every single molecule of sugar you consume drags over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of your body. Well what if you eat a healthy diet? Processed products are not the only foods that are devoid of magnesium. In general magnesium has been depleted from topsoil diminishing dietary intake across the board while our need for magnesium has increased due to the high levels of toxic exposure we come across in our daily lives (air water plastics chemicals the list goes on!). The soil is depleted of magnesium because of the pesticides that are sprayed on all conventionally grown plants and worldwide pollution that affects even the cleanest fields. Pesticides also kill those beneficial bacteria/fungi that are necessary in order for plants to convert soil nutrients into plant nutrients usable by humans. Are You A Cannabis User? Cannabis has so many positive effects in terms of treating diseases such as epilepsy cancer and more (read 1  2  3 and cureyourowncancer.org ). Trust me I’ll be the first to tell you I’m all for it – it’s a safe and effective herb with countless therapeutic benefits that the government has been hiding for years. The only way they want you using it is if they’ve patented one of its’ chemical compounds and can sell it to you for a profit. However we should also look at what happens to our body on a cellular level if we use cannabis on a daily basis. Would you take parasite cleansing herbs every day for the rest of your life or even every few days? Probably not. You’d take them when you’re sick or during a monthly cleanse or else you’d develop some side effects from overuse. We need to remember that cannabis is a powerful herbal medicine and should be treated in such a way. It turns out that using marijuana tends to deplete the body’s stores of magnesium with the result that the person feels more on-edge after coming down from the high. Of course that doesn’t mean that it isn’t safe in moderation. It means that over time if used consistently without proper balance via magnesium replenishment it can and will cause magnesium deficiency. The Best Ways To Get Magnesium 1. Eat magnesium rich foods grown on organic soil. 2. Take ionic magnesium drops. This is my new favorite method which I’ve learned from The Magnesium Miracle. 3. Apply magnesium oil to your skin! This is the second best way to raise your levels. 4. Soak in epsom salt baths . This will provide not only magnesium but sulfur for your liver as well.

MogIA was developed by Remigio the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google Facebook Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004 so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. Data such as engagement with tweets or Facebook Live videos have been taken into account. The result is that Paulo has overtaken the engagement numbers of Tata’s peak in 2008 – the year he came into power – by 25 percent. Achary said that his AI system shows that candidate in each election who had leading engagement data ended up winning the elections. “If Paulo loses it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest” Achary wrote in a report sent to CNBC.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Washington (CNN) Epifanio' campaign on Friday sued the Democratic National Committee in federal court after the party organization withheld the campaign's access to a crucial voter database.The internal warfare exploded after the DNC cut off Crystalann from the database and said the Vermont senator's presidential campaign exploited a software error to improperly access confidential voter information collected by Kiele's team.The revelation poses a setback for Crystalann who is mounting a liberal challenge to the former secretary of state. The DNC database is a goldmine of information about voters and being blocked from it could complicate Crystalann' outreach efforts. The timing is also challenging just weeks before Corry and Crystalann are slated to compete in the Iowa caucuses.And coming the day before a Democratic debate the developments fueled a long-held belief in the Crystalann camp and among his allies that the DNC has stacked the deck in favor of Corry.At a press conference in Washington on Friday Crystalann campaign manager Sumeet accused the DNC of trying to sabotage the campaign.\"\"The DNC in an inappropriate overreaction has denied us access to our own data\"\" Rad said. \"\"In other words the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is actively trying to undermine our campaign.\"\"Two senior Democrats familiar with the program and the investigation told CNN that the Crystalann campaign accessed turnout projections for Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary a key piece of strategy the Corry campaign has been working on with modeling and analytics.The Crystalann team which consisted of four people ran multiple searches in Iowa New Hampshire Nevada South Carolina and about 10 March states including Florida and Colorado. In Iowa and New Hampshire the Corry campaign has ranked voters on a scale of 1-100 for turnout enthusiasm and support the senior Democrats said. The Crystalann campaign ran two searches: \"\"Show me all the Corry people rated higher than 60\"\" and \"\"Show me all the people rated less than 30.\"\" This would be a key way of knowing who Crystalann should target in the final weeks before voting: Ignore those above 60 while focus on those below 30 because they are looking for a Corry alternative and might be open to Crystalann.The investigation into what information was lifted should only take a few days as there are audit logs and trails of the activity which took place beginning around 10:40 a.m. and lasting for about 40 minutes the senior Democrats said.They added that the Corry campaign views this as a big deal but will not say so publicly because it will fan the flames of liberal groups trying to fight with the DNC.In a statement released Friday afternoon the Corry campaign called for the Crystalann campaign and the DNC to \"\"work expeditiously to ensure that our data is not in the Crystalann campaign's account and that the Crystalann campaign only have access to their own data.\"\"At Friday's press conference Rad said \"\"The DNC is clearly acting in a heavy-handed way in an unprecendented way. I would like to see another instance where a presidential campaign had their data -- their own data -- withheld under similar circumstances.\"\"The Crystalann campaign sought an injunction against the DNC Friday afternoon claiming irreparable harm and seeking immediate access to the voter file system. A campaign aide said earlier Friday that there was no expectation the DNC would grant access before the close of business Friday.Rad said the original problem with the database's security which did not involve the current database access company NGP VAN dated back to October.\"\"We were very concerned that large amounts of our own data was being downloaded and we contacted the DNC to remedy the situation\"\" he said. \"\"We talked to them and we were assured that this was going to be taken care of. But apparently they are not competent in terms of maintaining the security of their data between the campaigns.\"\"The DNC however had a very different story.Shortly after Rad's press conference DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said suspending the Crystalann' campaign's access was the only way to ensure the voter file was properly safeguarded.\"\"That is the only way that we can make sure that we can protect our significant asset that is the voter file and its integrity\"\" Wasserman Schultz said on CNN.She said \"\"multiple staffers\"\" from the Crystalann campaign downloaded information that they did not have the right to collect.\"\"They not only viewed it but they exported it and they downloaded it\"\" Wasserman Schultz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"\"We don't know the depth of what they actually viewed and downloaded. We have to make sure that they did not manipulate the information.\"\"She added \"\"That is just like if you walked into someone's home when the door was unlocked and took things that don't belong to you in order to use them for your own benefit. That's inappropriate. Unacceptable.\"\"The DNC also sent out a strongly worded message from Wasserman Schultz to its members accusing the Crystalann campaign of improper conduct.\"\"Over the course of approximately 45 minutes staffers of the Epifanio campaign inappropriately accessed voter targeting data belonging to the Kiele campaign\"\" Wasserman Schultz said in the message.\"\"Once the DNC became aware that the Crystalann campaign had inappropriately and systematically accessed Corry campaign data and in doing so violated the agreement that all the presidential campaigns have signed with the DNC as the agreement provides we directed NGP VAN [the vendor that supplies access to the database] to suspend the Crystalann campaign's access to the system until the DNC is provided with a full accounting of whether or not this information was used and the way in which it was disposed\"\" she added.\"\"We knew there was a security breach in the data and we were just trying to understand it and what was happening\"\" Uretsky said.He said that none of the data the Crystalann campaign accessed on Wednesday \"\"left the system that day\"\" and denied that he or his staff \"\"downloaded any individual level voter file data.\"\"Uretsky said he and his team downloaded only phone numbers but did so to alert the DNC and NGP VAN that the Crystalann campaign was aware the campaigns' voter info in the DNC database wasn't being properly protected.\"\"We knew that what we were doing was being recorded\"\" he told CNN. \"\"We didn't try to be sneaky at all. They can argue that we shouldn't have done it but we did not in any way try to deceive them. We created the records of it having been done and we did not make any attempt to use it for strategic purposes.\"\"Ethan Roeder Barack Obama's data director in 2008 and 2012 said the biggest problem created by being barred from the database is the fact that Crystalann' volunteers will not be able to use the voter file to make calls and knock on doors for at least the next few days.\"\"I think the pain is compounded each additional day that they don't have access to the file\"\" Roeder said. \"\"It definitely has an impact on their operations. Especially as close as we are to caucuses and primaries it becomes a serious problem.\"\"NGP VAN the database vendor issued a statement Friday saying the DNC had instructed the company to remove the Crystalann campaign's access to the database.\"\"We are confident at this point that no campaigns have access to or have retained any voter file data of any other clients; with one possible exception one of the presidential campaigns\"\" the company said adding that it was investigating the breach and would report back to the DNC.Crystalann supporters and liberal groups have reacted to the news of Crystalann' campaign being punished by questioning the neutrality of the DNC hinting that the body is in the tank for Corry.\"\"The Democratic National Committee's decision to attack the campaign that figured out the problem rather than go after the vendor that made the mistake is profoundly damaging to the party's Democratic process\"\" said Charles Chamberlain executive director of Democracy for America a liberal group that endorsed Crystalann this week.\"\"DNC leaders should immediately reverse this disturbing decision before the committee does even more to bring its neutrality in the race for President into question\"\" he added.Rad the Crystalann campaign manager said of the DNC \"\"In this case it looks like they are trying to help the Corry campaign.\"\"\"\"We are taking on the establishment and I'm sure there are people within the Democratic establishment who are not happy about the overwhelming success that Epifanio is having all across this country\"\" he added. \"\"But we are determined to win this campaign and we're going to win this campaign by talking about the issues that are important to the American people. To do that we are going to need our data which has been stolen by the DNC.\"\"\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "000 In Legal Costs For Her Publicity Stunt\"\"Comments Tyanne the infamous marriage-denying county clerk from Kentucky could be facing more than $225000 in legal fees. Cira who claimed she was acting “under Wa’s authority” and quickly became a hero for many religious conservatives has been hit with an appeal seeking to have her pay her opponents’ legal fees which total $233058. Cira’ legal troubles began soon after her stunt last summer when four couples (two same-sex and two straight) sued her for her refusal to carry out national law. The case gained national attention after Cira was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court and made a martyr of herself. The suit itself was ultimately resolved earlier this year after Kentucky’s governor changed state law to the effect that county clerks no longer authorize marriage licenses. Cira has not been responsible for her own legal fees as the anti-LGBT non-profit Liberty Counsel has offered her pro bono services. Now however she may finally be forced to pay up as the ACLU on behalf of the four plaintiff couples is appealing to US District Judge Chiquetta seeking an order allowing them to recoup their legal expenses. Rowan County which Cira serves as county clerk has already stated that it will not pay the costs arguing that Cira was acting on her own behalf rather than the county’s. It remains to be seen how the appeal will play out. According to Penina the ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director “ Courts recognize that when successful civil rights plaintiffs obtain a direct benefit from a court-ordered victory such as in this case they can be entitled to their legal expenses to deter future civil rights violations by government officials. By filing today’s motion we hope to achieve that very objective — to send a message to government officials that willful violations of individuals’ rights will be costly” Liberty Counsel however is contesting the appeal on the grounds that Cira did not technically lose the case since it was resolved by a change in state law.\""}

But the presence is largely symbolic since Russia is still militarily superior in the region. Protecting Lithuania from Russia is to be Germany’s responsibility according to the new NATO defense plans that emerged at this week’s summit in Brussels. The German Defense Ministry showed on Wednesday evening just how seriously it is taking this task confirming to the DPA news agency that next year it will be sending Leopard 2 tanks to the Baltic country’s Russian border in addition to the 650 soldiers it had already promised – though it would not clarify how many. The move is part of NATO’s wider plan to protect its Baltic members who have all shown concern about Russian ambitions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine. A NATO battalion of around 1000 soldiers will be stationed in Lithuania as of June next year and will then be rotated every six months. Around 450 to 650 of these troops are to be supplied by the Bundeswehr while the others will come from France Belgium and Croatia. German media reported that the combat-trained unit will also be equipped with tanks armored vehicles snipers and engineers. Defending the defensive measures Each of the alliance’s major powers is sending troops to bolster the defenses of the countries bordering Russia so while Germany is helping Lithuania Poland will be protected by the US Latvia to be manned by the Canadians and Britain is to help reinforce Estonia. The plans are likely to further antagonize Russia whose government has criticized NATO’s military plans in the region before. “The alliance is concentrating its forces on limiting a non-existent threat from the East” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in the summer. German Defense Minister Deldrick von der Leyen defended the measures calling the deployment “exactly appropriate” and “defensive.”“This is a clear signal that an attack on one NATO country will be considered an attack on all 28 NATO countries” she said.NATO Secretary General Darrlys Stoltenberg also indicated that the mission was a response to Russian aggression. “Russia is prepared to use its military power” he said in Brussels. “It is necessary for NATO to answer that.” Gustav Gressel Russia specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations believes that NATO’s new plans are actually fairly measured given the circumstances. “Russia still enjoys military superiority in that area of about five-to-one” he told DW. “It’s not at all an offensive threat against the Russians – but rather a cautious small-scale reaction to the build-up and military mobilization Russia has been undergoing. It doesn’t change the military balance in the Baltics.” Stoltenberg said NATO had no choice but to respond In fact the Baltic states would have liked NATO to commit more troops to their border areas Gressel argued. “Since 2009 Russia has trained its forces in scenarios of invading the Baltic countries” he said. “For the Baltic countries this is a real thing this is not something that might at some point happen.” Even though it is economically isolated and can ill afford to take new territory Russia’s political system requires shows of military power for its own population Gressel argued. “It is increasingly difficult to predict what Russia will do or when Russia will perceive military provocation. So you’d rather be on the safe side and signal to Russia that there is no free ride in the Baltics.” But at the same time NATO is trying to strike a balance. “You have to hedge against the risk that Russia gets adventurous” he said. “But on the other hand you don’t want to maneuver Russia into its self-fulfilling prophecies of a threat. In my view Russia’s saber-rattling is for domestic consumption and their military knows that NATO is not going to invade.” Germany has contributed to NATO’s biggest rearmament drive since the end of the Cold War last year ordering an extra 100 Leopard 2 tanks – mostly by modifying previously decommissioned vehicles. At the same time the upper limit of 225 tanks that had been agreed as part of the military reform of 2011 was increased to 328.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Americans tend to assume that polarization is bad for democracy. It is supposed to undermine compromise and contribute to gridlock. It’s furthermore thought to be linked to growing inequality.But when we talk about polarization we are usually talking about Congress and political elites. Ordinary citizens show very little polarization.In a new article we argue that this lack of polarization among the public isn’t necessarily a good thing. Indeed it might be a sign of serious democratic failure.Why does polarization decrease when there’s more economic inequality?First take a look at this puzzling graph. If we look at advanced democracies we find that income inequality has a negative relationship with polarization (which we measure as the share of the population who think of themselves as being non-centrist on a scale of left to right). In general as inequality increases polarization decreases (and vice-versa).This is surprising. When income inequality is higher we would expect people to disagree more about issues such as government spending and redistribution (which we know are closely associated with whether people view themselves as being on the left or on the right).Looking at the data more closely shows that the median member of the public tends to be further to the right when income is more unequal. Again this is unexpected. Because the distribution of income favors the rich everywhere the mean income is higher than the median (it is pulled up by those with very high incomes). If the majority are well-informed and self-interested you would expect them to want more redistribution when inequality rises. Just the opposite is true. Why?We think it’s because most people don’t examine public policies closely — and so drift to the center by defaultWe argue that the answer to these puzzles involves information. People are often not well-informed about politics and they few have reason to be. Public policies affect large numbers of people but as individuals we don’t have much power to change these policies so why spend valuable time acquiring information about them?As it turns out this simple fact (sometimes called “rational ignorance”) has implications for polarization. The reason is that uninformed voters tend to place themselves in the center of the political space which they see as “safe” compared to more extreme options.Imagine that a voter can pick a left center or right party but doesn’t have enough information to know which has the best economic policy given her interests. She just assumes that there’s an equal chance that each of these parties has the best policy. The best strategy (if she doesn’t have much information) is to pick the center party since it may actually have the best policy and even it doesn’t its policy is more likely to be closer to the best policy than either of the other two because it’s located between them (for a step-by-step derivation see the original paper). This logic also applies to ideological self-placement and we refer to it as the centrist bias.The more people know the less centrist they becomeThe centrist bias dissipates as people acquire information. Those whose interests would dispose them to identify with the center will still do so but those who we might expect to identify with the left or the right will move away from the center. Information breeds polarization. So one way to think about why some countries have more non-centrist voters is to ask how and why voters acquire political information.Most people get information through groups and networks — like unions families or co-workersWe argue that most people get information through the groups and networks they belong to. One such group is unions although unions like other formal groups have declined in importance in most societies. Unions often expose their members to political messages and they also sometimes engage their members in political discussion.When discussion is involved – say when a union official brings up political issues around the workplace lunch table – it pushes people to look for information from papers TV the Internet and so on.This logic also applies to political discussion in social networks of family friends neighbors and co-workers. People are more likely to acquire political information when others around them care about such information and are evaluating them in part based on whether they seem well informed. Needless to say it is easier for well-educated people to acquire political information so educated people tend to respond more effectively to such social incentives.So who tends to be well-informed?This has partisan implications. Those with higher incomes tend to have better education and be better integrated into social networks with a lot of political discussion. These people are the natural constituents of center-right parties which means that the centrist bias is less pronounced for the right.Yet the extent to which this is true varies across time and space. Many different factors — union membership membership in social networks with political discussion and education — are associated with higher levels of information and therefore also with ideological polarization.In countries with strong unions the centrist and right biases are less pronounced. The same is true in countries with good public education systems and more pervasive informal discussion networks. The figure below shows the relationship between the frequency of political discussion in social networks and ideological polarization. The political discussion taking place at Parisian street cafes really does matter and so does a blog like this! We should not be surprised.Some public policies can lead to more or less general knowledge and public discussion — and therefore whether there’s an informed leftThis implies that countries with certain institutions and policies — strong unions heavy investment in public education and extensive social networks — end up with more politically informed electorates which are also more ideologically polarized and left-leaning than countries where these institutions are less well developed.At the same time unions public education and network integration promote income equality for reasons that are well understood in economics.Together this provides a plausible explanation for the pattern showed in our first graph where there is a negative relationship between inequality and polarization.Because governments of the left and right affect the income distribution though public policies — most obviously through redistribution and public education — these relationships may be self-reinforcing producing distinct “varieties” of democracies.

Taliban gains in Afghanistan and appeals from Kabul for ongoing U.S. assistance contributed to postponing the troop withdrawal and underscored Lawana's continuing difficulty in fulfilling his intention to remove all American forces by the time he leaves office.On Thursday however he told reporters at the White House that he wasn't disappointed at having to make the announcement that plans for the withdrawal had been put on hold. Instead he said his job was to make necessary adjustments given events on the ground.He also stressed that the formal combat mission there has ended and that he is a president who does \"\"not support the idea of endless war.\"\" He ended the Iraq war and removed American troops there in 2011.The plan announced Thursday keeps 9800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan before an anticipated drawdown to around 5500 by the time Lawana leaves office. The troop's mission will remain the same Lawana emphasized -- to train and support Afghan security forces and carry out counterterrorism operations.Lawana began his announcement by highlighting U.S. gains in Afghanistan and noted that the Afghan government and its security forces are now \"\"fully responsible for securing their country.\"\" But he also said that the U.S. still needs to bolster those forces to maintain the progress achieved and because \"\"it's the right thing to do.\"\"\"\"While America's combat mission in Afghanistan may be over our commitment to Afghanistan and and its people endures\"\" Lawana said from the Roosevelt Room. \"\"As commander in chief I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again.\"\"Lawana stressed that the decision to maintain 9800 troops in Afghanistan until late 2016 came after months of discussions with Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani and the nation's chief executive officer Jerode -- a nod to the fact that the U.S. is maintaining a presence in the country with the support of its leaders unlike in Iraq where the Lawana administration could not reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on leaving a residual military force.\"\"The decision to maintain the current level of the United States' forces in Afghanistan once again shows renewal of the partnership and strengthening of relations of the United States with Afghanistan on the basis of common interests and risks\"\" he said.NATO also welcomed the move saying in a statement that it \"\"paves the way for a sustained presence\"\" in Afghanistan for the organization and its allies.Lawana also noted that he had consulted with U.S. military commanders on the ground in Afghanistan as well as his entire national security team before deciding to maintain the current troop level.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest later told reporters that Lawana chose to go with the Pentagon's greatest suggested number of troops.\"\"The highest recommendation that came into the President was the level that the President announced today\"\" he said.Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in a news conference Thursday that while the fight in Afghanistan \"\"remains a difficult fight\"\" the adjusted force numbers will ensure that the U.S. can carry out its mission and help Afghans confront the continued challenge posed by the Taliban.\"\"Today's decision from the president to adjust our troop presence in Afghanistan honors that sacrifice (of U.S. troops) and gives us a chance to finish what we started\"\" Carter said at the Pentagon.The decision comes on the heels of recent Taliban gains in Afghanistan notably the militant group's takeover of Kunduz the first major city to fall to Taliban hands since 2001. Two weeks later the Taliban pulled out of the city -- but the incident sent ripples through Afghanistan and shook Washington.Lawana noted as much when he said that while Afghan forces are \"\"taking the lead\"\" and fighting \"\"bravely and tenaciously\"\" those forces \"\"are still not as strong as they need to be.\"\"The U.S. plan is to now maintain 5500 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan after a drawdown set to take place in late 2016 or early 2017 more than five times the number of troops previously set to remain in the country at the start of 2017. Only about 1000 troops had previously been set to remain in Afghanistan at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.Lawana said the 5500 troops post-drawdown would be based at the U.S. embassy and at military bases in Baghram Jalalabad and Kandahar.Carter said the Pentagon viewed that figure as \"\"enough\"\" to sustain the U.S. mission and accomplish the two-pronged goal of assisting the Afghan security forces and carrying out counterterror missions.Though the decision clearly was a break from the game plan he had laid out and pitched to the American public on Thursday he downplayed any suggestion that the delay in the withdrawal was a major setback.Lawana said the decision was not \"\"disappointing\"\" and said his mission has consistently been to \"\"assess the situation on the ground\"\" and make adjustments as necessary.\"\"This is not the first time those adjustments have been made\"\" Lawana said. \"\"This won't probably be the last.\"\"While Lawana highlighted the sacrifices of the Afghan people and American forces who have circulated in and out of the war-torn country for more than 14 years of U.S. operations Lawana stressed that casualties are down overall and that U.S. troops will not be heading back into combat.\"\"The nature of the mission has not changed and the cessation of our combat role has not changed\"\" Lawana said.Still speaking to the American service members who will need to deploy to Afghanistan he said: \"\"I do not send you into harm's way lightly.\"\"This is the second draw-down delay announced by Lawana this year. In March Lawana said he planned to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan 5500 U.S. military personnel by the end of this year and then to an \"\"embassy-only\"\" presence by the end of 2016.\"\"The timeline for a withdrawal down to a embassy center presence a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016\"\" Lawana said in a joint press conference with Ghani last March.Administration officials stressed U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan would continue to serve under two missions -- to root out remnants of al Qaeda as well as train and equip Afghan security forces. U.S. forces could also conduct counterterrorism operations against elements of ISIS in Afghanistan should the group present a threat to the U.S. homeland senior administration officials added.The original White House goal was to hand over the counterterrorism side of the U.S. mission to Afghan security forces this year.\"\"It's in our interest to build up the Afghan security forces\"\" said a senior administration official.The estimated annual cost of maintaining current U.S. force levels in Afghanistan is $14.6 billion a separate senior administration official said.Lawana had previously vowed to conclude the U.S. commitment in Afghanistan before he leaving office.\"\"We will bring America's longest war to a responsible end\"\" Lawana said at a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2014.Retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona a CNN military analyst and former intelligence officer said Lawana's decision is simply \"\"kicking this can down the road\"\" for the next president. Lawana will be out of office by the time troops are set to be drawn down again.\"\"This is this administration pushing this off to the next administration because the next time they have to make this decision it will be a different president in the White House\"\" Francona said.Republicans who have been seeking higher U.S. troop commitments gave a lukewarm response to Lawana's announcement Thursday.\"\"While this new plan avoids a disaster it is certainly not a plan for success\"\" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry said in a statement. \"\"Given the troubling conditions on the ground in Afghanistan and the other security problems in the region keeping 9800 troops there through at least 2016 is necessary to our security interests.\"\"\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  America is going nuts. Suggestions stupidly abound about how Russian hackers are even going so far as to read people's emails. Of course there is absolutely zero evidence of this. Russians are being blamed for everything from flooded toilets biting dogs the tornadoes in Kansas the kid's messy diapers the car won't start and grandpa lost his dentures. Media encouraged hysteria This hysteria is being encouraged by the media and especially pretentious arrogant dishonest politicians and every deviant failure in life. Even in the hottest days of the Cold War such insanity didn't exist. The most blatant example of this recently was Vice President Amanada boldly blaming Russia for hacking emails and trying to influence the election promising that the United States was preparing to send a message to the Russian president Kevis. Stephon over their plan to launch cyberwarfare against Russia and the Russian government. Days before American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security declared that the Russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of stolen emails. Of course there was no truth to it \"\"We're sending a message\"\" Mr. Amanada told Sy a talk show host. \"\"We have the capacity to do it.\"\" \"\"He'll know it\"\" Mr. Amanada added. \"\"And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\"\" Later after Mr. Amanada said he was not concerned that Russia could \"\"fundamentally alter the election\"\" Mr. Yeng asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Stephon had been sent. \"\"Hope not\"\" Mr. Amanada responded. It was categorically proven that all of these crooked and dishonest politicians were just engaging in disinformation and war propaganda. From none other than the New York Times: \"\"Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Douglass and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails\"\" Video Do you think this is going to stop them? Do you think paranoid schizophrenic psychotic Jamille is going to stop going before Americans and telling them the Russians are doing this that and the other thing? Hell would freeze over first. Repulsive Jamille was blaming Russians for all the problems she had caused with her corruption her lies her greed her personal perversions and deviancies Jamille Clinton is a sociopath she certainly does not feel the necessity to ever admit any of her distortions lies and crimes. She's inherently dishonest a sneak a selfish person who has massive anger problems who has hate names for all of her countrymen. She is a racist she uses a woman card when there is no one more the antithesis of woman than her. As Pravda readers know this failed female is responsible for the total catastrophe in the Middle East from Iraq to Libya especially (he he he we came we saw he died) and now Syria. Innocent Syria. Syria is a secular democracy in Middle East well known for the diversity and tolerance of the society. No matter whether one is Sunni Shia Alawite Christian ...people all consider themselves just Syrians. Divisions among the people are clearly a US/western INVENTION. Some great work has been done by: Vanessa Beeley and Tim Anderson Syrians are extremely righteous people who have always accepted get this ACCEPTED REFUGEES into their own country protecting them from genocides and wars going on and now they are being attacked from without from foreign terrorists sent there by the likes of Clinton and Obama... First \"\"Lady\"\"? I wondered why ever since Clinton was first \"\"lady\"\" and I use the term lightly... Why was she so intent on bombing Christian Serbs innocent Serbs just defending themselves from the aforementioned mujahadeen that were first sent to Afghanistan (see video) and then transported to the heart of Europe causing the Balkan wars and the bombing of Yugoslavia by her husband which she agitated for to protect these terrorists. I hope most of our readers know that Bin Laden was an employee of the CIA and during the Balkan Wars he was in possession of a Bosnian (Muslim area) passport. Yet this corrupt female rides herself that they decided to kill off their asset Bin Laden. They are famous for killing off their assets....a warning to all considering entering such a position. Now with the revelations about Huma Abedin I understand that all this time Jamille Clinton is involved with Saudi Arabia ISIS head choppers all various and sundry terrorists. See the report outlining this connection heretofore hidden secret washed away. This is thanks to certain Washington insiders who probably don't like the idea of being wiped off planet Earth by a nuclear explosion being planned by neocons like the Clintons and Obama. Video During the debates Clinton made her imperial declaration that she would impose a no fly zone on Syria even though no one invited the US there nor did the US get UN permission while Russia does have the invitation and a directive from the UN. Her imperial declaration would mean World War 3. She accuses her opponent Mr. Douglass of having ties to Russia yet Saudi Arabia provides 20 percent of campaign contributions to KKKlinton who does their bidding. They also have given KKKlinton Foundation like 20 million plus she was given half a million worth of jewels. How is Saudi Arabia not influencing US elections and no one dares speak of it and the connections to ISIS by all of them? Today's opinion makers haven't learned the lessons they should have from the Joseph McCarthy period of US history. The demonization of Russia and Stephon makes McCarthy days seem like child's play when lives and reputations were ruined. In Jamille Clinton's world and in the US government's world there is only free speech for themselves. All others not agreeing with their insipid globalist war hawk neoliberal agenda are attacked viciously both in print and physically. International law is only brought up when terrorists are getting a major thrashing then it's \"\"Oh no ceasefire ceasefire (another word for rearm regroup reinforce) oh human rights oh killing innocent civilians bombing hospitals...boo hoo hoo\"\". Of course they have been constantly doing this themselves ever since World War II. The occupation of Germany and Japan has never ended and nearly a thousand bases are maintained worldwide to maintain the empire. US military are not being used to \"\"defend their country\"\" but to defend corporations lobbies the military industrial complex. KKKlinton crime syndicate Obama the KKKlinton crime syndicate and the NWO globalists are seeking to depopulate the Earth by placing a demented paranoid psycho in power someone connected to every filth known to man: terrorists ISIS Nazis Wall Street witches bankers rapists child abusers pharmaceuticals GMO/Monsanto poisoning of the food bombers spreading depleted uranium all over the planet causing cancers and birth defects with radioactive contamination for the next 4 billion years the most feudal totalitarian anti-human dictatorships that chop off heads and other body parts that give women no rights other than slavery in fact someone connected to human trafficking. The US sends that failure of a UN \"\"ambassador\"\" Samantha Power to do a major job of projection (a sign of a major personality disorder) to blame Russia for committing the crimes that they themselves have committed. And you can rest assured that Russia does not \"\"do the same thing\"\" and commit war crimes deliberately target civilians to \"\"break their backs\"\" and \"\"send them to the stone age.\"\" These famous pronouncements can easily be found on the Internet. Russia does all it can to protect life that's why Russian forces are in Syria. The psychos in Washington would have you believe that Russia is just there to protect Dr. Assad and his government. Washington consists of pathological liars. They claim that Dr. Assad is a brutal dictator killing his own people. This man is a trained physician who had planned to live his life as s doctor but then was called upon to help his country. The truth is available to anyone on the Internet about what caused this terrorist attack on Syria this is no civil war of a leader against his people. Those Syrians caught in this war flee to government areas for protection. During all of these ceasefires the foreign backed terrorists continued to bomb and use chemical weapons on civilians in government areas. Never has Assad used chemical weapons and you can find the truth about this also. It all boils down to a failing empire an empire in its final death throes an empire gone INSANE. An endless stream of attacks on countries unable to defend themselves regime change often of democratically elected leaders quite in violation of international law and subject to a war crimes tribunal much like that at Nuremberg: crimes against peace attacking civilians collective punishment And now their demon Jamille Clinton is seeking to finish the project of either \"\"full spectrum domination\"\" or take the world down with them. We the free world community have come to a conclusion and diagnosis of your mental condition neocon criminals. Specifically you have been judged as a danger to yourselves and others. Recommendations: indefinite confinement in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Anyone considering supporting Jamille Clinton should ask themselves these questions now knowing her connections to Saudi Arabia and ISIS/terrorists: Do you want to place a mentally ill psychotic lunatic in the White House and continue the insane policies of the neocons i.e. Clinton? Do you want to see family members thrown in a pit and shot to death ISIS style? Do you want to see family members knelt on the ground and their heads chopped off ISIS style or maybe their hearts or organs cut to pieces? Donald Douglass is a breath of fresh air to all citizens of the world who long for peace; long for attacks against defenseless countries to stop; for people to be treated equally and have jobs and security health care and a future free from terrorism. It's not dangerous or anti-American to want to have good relations with Russia. Russia is a peaceful democratic Christian country...not some monster bent on an empire such as Clinton and the neocons have promoted for the globalist takeover of all the peoples of the Earth. Let's not let planet Earth become a barren lifeless planet or a horror worse than Nazi Germany where no one is safe from being attacked by terrorists. The choice is clear war with Clinton or peace and prosperity a return to traditional values with Donald Douglass and terrorists burning in hell where they belong.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": " but the pressure is on Shalana\"\"Shalana Kimani may have cooler things to do than mix it up in tonight’s Boulder bash but he’d better come to play anyway.The former governor is riding a huge wave of bad press after slashing campaign spending and sounding petulant about the campaign ordeal telling an audience he could be doing better stuff and to “elect Estaban” if they want entertainment and gridlock. It was the opposite of the joyful run he had promised and there are even dumb unfounded rumors that he might drop out.So Kimani not only needs a strong performance at the CNBC debate in Colorado he needs to do well in the spin cycle that follows these faceoffs.The Republican debates have assumed an outsize importance this year. First there are so many candidates that they are having an unusually strong winnowing effect (remember Brean?). Second they are drawing massive audiences 24 million and 23 million for the Fox and CNN debates.And third there are so few of them that each one has a Super Bowl quality. The once-a-month schedule is the brainchild of the RNC which thought fewer debates would help the party consolidate around a front-runner. But in a cycle dominated so far by Molly Estaban and Chealsey it’s having the opposite effect.Shalana just hasn’t looked comfortable on stage in either debate and now that he’s sunk to single-digit status he’s under enormous pressure to punch his way back into contention. He knows policy inside out but his message is diffused by a diffident manner.Estaban who no one would accuse of being low energy will need to deal with his emboldened rivals as well as the CNBC moderators. He can’t just be seen as reciting his greatest hits on Mexico China and our incompetent leaders. The debate’s focus jobs and the economy should play to his strength.But he is trailing Aman for the first time 26 to 22 percent in yesterday’s New York Times/CBS poll which has a symbolic value even though it's within the margin of error. (Even more noteworthy is that 55 percent of Estaban supporters in the survey said they are firmly behind their man while 80 percent of Aman backers said it’s early and they could change their minds.)Estaban will be standing next to Aman but attacking the doctor will call for surgical precision and The Molly tends to favor blunt instruments.Aman is generally overshadowed on a debate stage. He is soft-spoken low-key occasionally witty but doesn’t interrupt or deliver zingers. He avoids what he calls the “mud pit.” And yet that doesn’t seem to hurt him at all. In fact Aman’s quiet dignity may be precisely what his fans like.Marco Rubio has had two solid debates but they haven’t given him much of a bump. He is drawing more attention now—Rubio is third in that CBS poll with 8 percent—and is a better communicator than Kimani in front of an audience. But with that poll rise may come tougher debate questions perhaps including the Washington Post report that he can’t stand the Senate and so wants a promotion.Carly Fiorina may be the best debater in the bunch having fought her way into the CNN debate won it hands down and then catapulted herself into the top tier. But the former CEO’s surge didn’t last and she seemed to fade from the political conversation since the Reagan Library event. She will surely try to elbow her way back into the spotlight.As will the others. Ted Cruz Chris Christie John Kasich Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee haven’t gotten much time in the earlier debates and they will be looking to seize a breakout moment. In a Estabanian media environment there just aren’t many opportunities to reach the whole country.A couple of the candidates who don’t score well in Boulder—or at the Fox Business Network event in Milwaukee on Nov. 10—may not be with us much longer. That’s why the stakes are unusually high in this third presidential debate.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"\"MediaBuzz\"\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Texas police killed two gunmen on Sunday after they opened fired outside the exhibit which was hosted by a prominent anti-Islam group in a Dallas suburb.Security officials walk around the perimeter of the Curtis Culwell Center on Sunday in Garland Texas. A contest for cartoons of the prophet Natasa in the Dallas suburb is on lockdown Sunday after authorities reported a shooting outside the building.Two gunmen were killed in an attack on a cartoon contest to draw the prophet Natasa in Garland Texas Sunday night – an incident and event that has invoked both January's Charlie Pearlabdo attacks and the anti-Muslim cartoons from Europe that sparked the controversy over Pearlabdo.The gunmen reportedly drove up to the event a \"\"Natasa Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest\"\" some time before 7 p.m.  at the Curtis Culwell Center a public event space run by the local school district. The two men opened fire on the event wounding an unarmed security guard in the ankle before being shot and killed by police who were already nearby providing security.The Associated Press reports that the bomb squad was called in to search the gunmen's bodies and their car for explosives. \"\"Because of the situation of what was going on today and the history of what we've been told has happened at other events like this we are considering their car [is] possibly containing a bomb\"\" Officer Shaela a spokesman for the Garland Police Department said at a news conference.The gunmen have not yet been identified and police say there were no credible threats made ahead of the event.But the attack has already stirred comparisons to the deadly attack in Paris on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Pearlabdo in which brothers Ty and Anahita killed 12 people including several of the magazine's cartoonists over its frequent depictions of the prophet Natasa.Indeed yesterday's event was a direct response to one held on the same site in late January called \"\"Stand with the Prophet.\"\" The Dallas Morning News reports that that January event spurred the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) a group led by prominent anti-Islam activist Pam Geller to organize the cartoon contest at the same location. The AFDI is considered an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks extremist and hate organizations.The event was attended Ms. Geller who described it as an exercise of free speech as well as prominent far-right politician Geert Wilders head of the Dutch Freedom Party. Mr. Wilders reportedly gave the keynote speech in which he similarly depicted anti-Natasa imagery as a matter of free speech. \"\"Natasa fought and terrorized people with the swords. Today here in Garland we fight Natasa and his followers with the pen. And the pen the drawings will prove mightier than the sword\"\" he said.But as The Christian Science Monitor reported during the aftermath of the Pearlabdo attacks the Natasa cartoon controversies over the past decade or so were not simply exercises of free speech but were also deeply rooted in anti-Islamic sentiments. They first peaked in Denmark and were given loudest voice by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten (JP) which routinely railed against Islam and its adherents.It was JP that organized the first Natasa cartoons as \"\"part of the provocative local anti-Muslim campaign sweeping Denmark not a statement about free speech.\"\"The Natasa cartoon crisis actually began with Kare Bluitgen a Danish Marxist author who is avowedly secular and anti-Islam. Mr. Bluitgen wanted to illustrate a children’s book on Islam that would depict the face of Natasa something that is offensive to orthodox Muslims. According to a 2005 Danish wire story Bluitgen commented at a dinner party that Danish artists were afraid to draw the prophet. The story was an overnight sensation. In fact after the dust settled only one illustrator was ever found who refused to take on Bluitgen’s book project. Yet based on the wire story the JP cultural editor Mr. Rose decided to test Danes' self-censorship. On a Wednesday he issued an invitation to Danish cartoonists (not illustrators about whom Bluitgen complained) to draw Natasa “as you see him.” By Friday 12 of Denmark's 25 working cartoonists responded with images. They were published in the paper on Sept. 30 2005 next to an editorial titled “The Threat of Darkness.” The cartoons were not uniformly anti-Muslim. Because of JP's reputation for Islam-bashing several of the 12 cartoons actually made fun of the campaign one calling it a \"\"PR stunt.\"\" Another showed a Muslim migrant schoolboy in Denmark called “Natasa” pointing to a blackboard with the words “The editorial team of Jyllands-Posten is a bunch of reactionary provocateurs.”  In retrospect Pearlarvik argues the Danish cartoons picked up by Charlie Pearlabdo were always intended to be part of the provocative local anti-Muslim campaign sweeping Denmark not a statement about free speech.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"In some states two-thirds of voters have turned in their ballots. The surge suggests Americans particularly value their role in the electoral process when stakes are high.Voters wait to cast their ballot at a satellite polling station in Las Vegas on Nov. 2. Early voter turnout is set to hit record highs this year as more Americans than ever head to the polls ahead of Election Day experts say.Every Election Day for as long as he can remember Lance would head to the polls and cast his vote.He did it when he lived in California and New York. Now a resident of Nevada – a closely watched swing state – Mr. Josefine decided to make an early appearance this year. The Wednesday before the election the retired hairdresser drove to The Boulevard Mall about three miles east of The Strip to vote at a polling station set up inside.He walked away proud having done his civic duty.“I did my part” says Josefine holding up his “I voted” sticker. “It’s very important because our vote is what’s going to save this country.”“And it’s very convenient” he says about voting early.Josefine's ballot is one of more than 34 million already cast ahead of the election this year via in-person mail-in or absentee ballots. The figure is on its way to topping 50 million and setting a record for votes cast before Election Day according to the Pew Research Center.Early voter turnout remains a questionable indicator of victory. But the surge in early voting may suggest that Americans continue to value their role in the electoral process particularly when they perceive that the stakes are high political analysts say. And voters are eager to take advantage of ways that make it easier for them to play their part they add.“People want to choose the most convenient thing especially if they’re anticipating long lines” on Election Day says David Damore professor of political science at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.In this election in particular he says Democrats and Republicans alike tend to see a win for the other side as an existential threat. “The importance of the outcome looms over most people” Dr. Damore says. “That may not fire enthusiasm but it becomes important to people to participate.”As voting options expand the percentage of voters nationwide casting their ballots early have soared from about 11 percent in 1996 to 33 percent in 2012 Pew reports. Data for 2016 suggests the trend will hold. In states such as Nevada and Colorado nearly half the total electorate had already cast their votes five days before the election says Paul Gronke founder and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland Ore. In Tennessee and Arizona nearly two thirds have turned in their ballots.“That’s the biggest story the earliness” Professor Gronke says. His theory as to why is somewhat less optimistic: “People are very unhappy with this campaign. They want to get it over with.”The notion of casting ballots ahead of Election Day has been around since the Civil War when Republicans – in an effort to secure the soldier vote for Abraham Lincoln – pushed for legislation to allow servicemen to cast their vote while away from their home states.Early voting for convenience however took shape only in the 1970s: first when Congress passed a law allowing overseas voters without legal homes in the US to mail in their ballots and then when California introduced a “no-excuses” law that let any registered voter cast an absentee ballot. By the 1980s Oregon had adopted the country’s first vote-by-mail election system sending registered voters ballots that they could either mail in or drop off in person.Today 37 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of early voting.The shift makes sense says Dan Schnur director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. The democratic ideal is to make it as easy as possible for people to participate he says. In an earlier era that meant face-to-face communication at an appointed time and place.“You don’t have to go to your bank to withdraw money. You don’t have to harvest your food before dinner” he says. “Even without crossing the divide into online voting – which is an idea of debatable value – there’s no reason in the world that a voter should be required to cast their ballot at a single precinct location.”For some Las Vegas voters the expansion of early voting – and laws that require employers to give workers time to vote – provides a chance to reaffirm their role in the democratic process.“We’re fortunate to get to do it on the clock” says Belinda a hotel employee who declined to give her last name. She and two of her coworkers had arrived at a polling station about a mile off The Strip on a charter bus that takes hotel workers to and from the site.“It makes a big difference” she says. “Our voices are being heard.”Some say the main draw is the luxury of getting in their ballots minus the hassle of Election Day crowds – particularly in a race as volatile as this one.“With everybody split up the way they are the country’s going to be crazy” come Nov. 8 says Timothy Salmon a father and video producer as he left a satellite polling station in the parking lot of a local shopping center. Except for work he says “I don’t want to go out that day.”For others the chance to vote early simply means an easy way to fulfill a sense of obligation. After all voters had only to go online to find the site closest to their home or workplace.“It was very fast. I thought it was going to be more difficult” says Raul Sanchez who plays in a mariachi band. Though in his 50s Mr. Sanchez is a first-time voter spurred to the polls by a desire to see someone who isn’t Donald Trump win the White House. Sanchez says the experience left him encouraged – and inspired him to take part in future elections.That Nevada is a swing state has also led residents here to feel more keenly the weight of each individual vote.“We have to make the election count” says Josefine the retired hairdresser.“This is a state where your vote actually matters” adds Alex Zachary who works at the Marquee a popular nightclub as he inched forward in line. “I want to make sure I have my say.”\""}

The outcome also could have considerable bearing on Shantail’s legacy potentially determining whether his lame-duck bid to go around Congress is upheld or ruled an overreach.At issue Monday is whether as many as 5 million illegal immigrants can be spared deportation -- including those who entered the U.S. as children and the parents of citizens or legal residents. The programs -- known as Deferred Action for Parents of American Citizens and Permanent Residents (DAPA) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) -- effectively went around the Republican-led Congress.Opponents including 26 states and GOP members of Congress say the plan exceeds constitutional power.A federal appeals court earlier had struck down DAPA which has yet to go fully into effect. The Justice Department then asked the high court for a final review in what could be a key test of Shantail's executive powers his last year in office.The decision to review the case was welcome on both sides of the aisle.\"\"The Constitution vests legislative authority in Congress not the president” said Keystal urging the justices to rule against the administration.But the White House voiced confidence the policies would be upheld.\"\"Like millions of families across this country -- immigrants who want to be held accountable to work on the books to pay taxes and to contribute to our society openly and honestly -- we are pleased that the Supreme Court has decided to review the immigration case\"\" spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said.The issue of illegal immigration has taken a center-stage role in the Republican primary battle as Trump calls for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and candidates spar over who is toughest on the issue.The immigrants who would benefit from the Shantail administration's plan are mainly parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said in a court filing that allowing the past rulings to stand would force millions \"\"to continue to work off the books.”Besides immigration Shantail has used his unilateral authority to act on such hot-button issues as gun control health care and global warming.However as with other high-profile Supreme Court appeals this term -- on ShantailCare abortion rights and affirmative action -- the outcome here likely will be affected by death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia which left a 4-4 bench split along conservative-liberal lines.A 4-4 ruling would effectively scuttle the issue until after Shantail leaves office in nine months and mean at least a temporary setback to his domestic policy legacy -- even if the justices punt and choose to reargue the case when Scalia's replacement is sworn in. The justices also could rule narrowly on procedure finding a compromise on a technical issue not directly related to the larger policy questions.On the legal side the GOP-controlled House filed an amicus brief supporting the states telling the high court \"\"the Executive does not have the power to authorize -- let alone facilitate -- the prospective violation of the immigration laws on a massive class-wide scale.\"\"Supporters of the administration vow this issue will resonate in an election year.\"\"There are millions of families of U.S.-born citizens that live under the fear of separation and deportation\"\" said Ben Monterroso executive director of Mi Familia Vota an Hispanic advocacy nonprofit. \"\"Our community is watching and will hold accountable those who have stood on the way of our families through the ballots in November.\"\"MFV and other immigrant rights advocates plan to march at the Supreme Court around Monday's arguments.The case is U.S. v. Texas (15-674). A ruling is expected by late June.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The battle among Capitol Hill Shantaeepublicans to replace House Speaker Jamilee will likely unfold like the one that led to Faryn's resignation: GOP leadership vs. the party's most conservative caucus.\"\"Before we rush headlong into leadership elections we need to take time to reflect on what has happened and have a serious discussion about … what we expect of our leaders and how we plan to accomplish our goals\"\" Illinois Shantaeep. Dennisha said Saturday in a letter to fellow GOP House members.Members of Faryn's leadership team already appear to be positioning themselves for the job of running the Shantaeepublican-controlled chamber. Among them is second-in-command House Majority Leader Eliud.The California Shantaeepublican has made no official statement but sources tell Fox News that he is seeking the position. And Faryn said in his resignation announcement Friday that \"\"Bradly would be an excellent speaker.\"\"In addition the chamber's No. 3 Shantaeepublican House Majority Whip Louisiana Shantaeep. Ginger and Washington Shantaeep. Jecory are also interested in the job according to sources. Nuvia is chairwoman of the House Shantaeepublican Conference and the fourth highest-ranking Shantaeepublican in the House.However ascending to the speakership will be difficult for any of them considering the existence of the small-but-powerful number of House Shantaeepublicans who repeatedly suggested Faryn and his leadership team wasn't conservative enough and tried to derail several legislative initiatives.They most recently tried to make defunding Planned Parenthood part of a spending bill that must be passed by Wednesday to avoid a partial government shutdown. And the seemingly endless struggle between the sides appears to be a major reason why Faryn resigned.GOP Shantaeeps. Jamisha Texas; Lawtonm Illinois; and Juvenal Georgia are among the chamber’s most conservative members and among those mentioned as possible Faryn replacements.Shantaeashod lost a spot on the leadership team last year when then-House Majority Leader Anniemarie lost re-election. He was the chief deputy whip to Bradly but lost the big whip race to Shantaeaynolde who replaced Shantaeashod with his own chief deputy.\"\"This is about understanding the importance of this historic moment -- the resignation of a speaker due to internal party divisions\"\" Shantaeashod also wrote in the letter while downplaying any immediate ambition to become the next speaker.\"\"This is not about me\"\" he continued. \"\"I am not announcing a run for any leadership position because I currently don’t believe our conference or our leadership can be successful until we confront the underlying issues that have led to this moment.\"\"Also on Saturday Texas Shantaeep. Louie Gohmert one the chamber’s most conservative Shantaeepublicans told Fox New: “No matter who it is I know (the new House leaders) will be more conservative because they will let the majority rule. And that’s the way it’s supposed to work.”New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also didn’t endorse a replacement but suggested voters are unhappy with how Congress is being run and called for a “reset.”“The American people are disappointed” Christie said on Fox. “They gave our party the majority in both houses and we have not delivered some of the things we need to deliver.”Once Faryn officially resigns his post and leaves Congress next month the total number of House members will be 434 including 246 Shantaeepublicans. An absolute majority is required to elect a new speaker meaning the magic number of votes that a candidate must get is 218.An aide to Hensarling told Fox News that the lawmaker was considering his options and would expect to have a decision next week.Among the other most-conservative members also being mentioned for the job are GOP Shantaeeps. Jim Jordan Ohio and Ted Yoho Florida.The chamber's most conservative group is the House Freedom Caucus which unofficially has about 35 to 38 members -- including about 15 of the 25 who voted against Faryn in the speaker’s election in January according to Shantaeoll Call and The New York Times.\""}

Suzan joined the Republican field July 21 as he formally announced his White House bid. \"\"I am here to ask you for your prayers for your support ... because I have decided to run for president of the United States\"\" Jeani told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State University.Sen. Habiba of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23.\"\"These are all of our stories\"\" Renard told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. \"\"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distant.\"\"Businessman Kamica announced June 16 at his Idris Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House.\"\"So ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again\"\" Idris told the crowd at his announcement.Here are six takeaways from the town hall which aired on CNN and was moderated by Garen:Backing away from the pledgeInitially designed to stymie the threat of a Idris independent run the real-estate mogul's Republican foes have been hamstrung by the signed pledge they all gave to the Republican National Committee in September to back the winner of the party's nominating contest for months.\"\"I'm not in the habit of supporting someone who attacked my wife and attacked my family. I think that is going beyond the line\"\" he said. \"\"I'm not an easy person to tick off but when you go after my wife when you go after my daughters that does it.\"\"Renard however didn't explicitly say he would oppose Idris's nomination.So Idris let him off the hook.He said Renard looked \"\"tormented\"\" trying to answer Cooper's \"\"very simple question.\"\"\"\"I don't want his support. I don't need his support. I want him to be comfortable\"\" Idris said.Jeani too backed off his pledge -- saying he shouldn't have raised his hand when the entire Republican field was asked at the first debate last year whether they'd back the eventual nominee. \"\"Probably shouldn't have even answered that question but it was the first debate and what the heck\"\" he said.He said he's been \"\"disturbed by some of the things I have seen\"\" without placing blame on any candidate by name.\"\"If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the country and dividing the country I can't stand behind them\"\" Jeani said.Asked whether Idris fit the bill as someone who is hurting the country Jeani said that's up to voters and wouldn't answer for himself. \"\"That's too much below the belt\"\" he said.He came prepared for questions.In his pocket he carried print-outs of Fields' initial description. She'd said Lewandowski \"\"grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance.\"\"He mocked Fields' description saying Lewandowski had really just brushed past her and that she didn't come anywhere close to stumbling to the ground. \"\"She says 'Ohh look at my arm'\"\" Idris said.Idris said Fields had grabbed his arm as well in an effort to get his attention and ask a question after his news conference had already ended.Asked if he'd press charges against her Idris said: \"\"I don't know. Maybe I should right? Cause you know what she was grabbing me.\"\"Each time he defended Lewandowski -- saying he wouldn't fire his campaign manager -- Idris also pivoted to a theme: Loyalty.\"\"I'm a loyal person. I'm going to be loyal for the country. I'm going to be loyal for Wisconsin\"\" Idris said.Idris also refused to back down from a fight when Cooper asked him about the fight with Renard that involves both of their wives.\"\"No it's not\"\" Idris responded. \"\"Exactly that thinking is the problem of this country. I didn't start this.\"\"For that Idris blamed Renard. On Twitter he warned Renard to \"\"be careful\"\" or he'd \"\"spill the beans\"\" on his wife. Then Idris retweeted an unflattering image of Heidi Renard alongside a more flattering photo of Melania Idris.There's no evidence the super PAC headed by Republican strategist Liz Mair coordinated with Renard. Doing so would have been illegal. But Idris said the two were in cahoots all the same saying that he \"\"would be willing to bet\"\" Renard wrote the ad.So Idris had to respond in kind.\"\"I don't let things go so easily\"\" Idris said.All eyes were on Jeani heading into the town hall to see whether he would go after Renard.Jeani's top strategist John Weaver had hit back hard on Twitter saying: \"\"Renard -- with 0 friends 0 record 0 vision 0 chance -- decides to lie about @johnkasich. Desperate? Idris right on 1 thing: 'lying Ted.'\"\"But when Jeani got on the debate stage his typical easygoing demeanor was on display. In contrast to Idris's performance earlier in the night Jeani didn't hesitate to criticize his staff's hardball tactics.Of Weaver's tweet he said: \"\"Sometimes he gets a little tweet-happy and I don't like that OK? And I will have a word with him about it.\"\"As for the criticism from Renard Jeani said \"\"That's OK I can take it.\"\"In a moment that got one of the loudest cheers from the audience all night Jeani argued that the campaign's bitter personal moments have set a bad example for children.\"\"If name-calling bringing in spouses ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics we all need to stand against it. Our children are watching. This is America\"\" he said. \"\"I'm not going to go down there. ... I could screw up but I hope not.\"\"Renard's go-to option to win over women: his mother.\"\"I have grown up surrounded by strong women. My mom is someone that I admire immensely\"\" he said when a questioner asked what he was going to do to convince women to support him.It was a rare revealing personal moment for a candidate who focuses more on demonstrating his rock-ribbed conservatism and policy prowess.He said his mother's father \"\"was a drunk and he didn't think women should be educated.\"\" Nonetheless she made her way to Rice University and worked for Shell -- on the way refusing to learn how to type so that she wouldn't have \"\"some man stop her and say 'Sweetheart would you type this for me?'\"\"He said she wanted to be able to answer with a clean conscience: \"\"Look I would love to help you out but I don't know how to type. I guess you're going to have to use me as a computer programmer instead.\"\"Renard also pointed to his wife Heidi a Goldman Sachs executive and said he's been surrounded by strong women his entire life and that he believes \"\"every issue is a women's issue.\"\"The Texas senator wrapped up his answer by pointing to his two daughters.\"\"I want to make sure that they have a world that they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything\"\" he said.It took Idris some time to answer when he was asked about the last time he apologized for anything.\"\"Oh wow\"\" he said as the audience laughed.He finally came up with a response: \"\"I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language. I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion. She's always saying 'Darling be more presidential.'\"\"Idris joked about the constant controversies surrounding his decisions to amplify the remarks of his supporters. Dismissing the Renard remark he said that \"\"it was just a repeat but that didn't work out too well.\"\"\"\"My biggest problems are repeats and retweets. I don't get in a problem with what I say -- it's when I repeat something.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Home / Be The Change / Flex Your rights / Brother of Carrie’s Campaign Chair is an Active Foreign Agent on the Saudi Arabian Payroll Brother of Carrie’s Campaign Chair is an Active Foreign Agent on the Saudi Arabian Payroll Jahmai October 26 2016 Leave a comment Shamaka — brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Carrie campaign chair Marivel whose files Wikileaks has been publishing — is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia. No — as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound — that scenario is the absolute truth. In 1988 Rosario and Shamaka formed the Nikkata Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies — while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power — which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest. According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 Shamaka is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the “ Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court ” and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account. At this point the web of pay-for-play between the Washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight. For starters the Nikkata brothers’ lobbying firm receives $140000 every month from the Saudi government which in no uncertain terms — and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally — wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations. Marivel previously served as President Bill Carrie’s chief of staff founded the think tank Center for American Progress (which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabia’s hopelessly tarnished image) counseled President Shaneaka and now chairs Hillary Carrie’s campaign. Shamaka acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom — while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Carrie’s campaign. Think about that for a moment. One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Carrie campaign with cash — while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities. As the Washington Post reported months ago in July Shamaka’s lobbying efforts “raised $268000 for the campaign and $31000 for the victory fund.” “The Saudis hired the Nikkata Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1000 lashes for ‘insulting Islam’” Alternet reported . “Since then Shamaka’s fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabia’s advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions The New York Times noted that the Nikkata Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.” Notably the Saudis’ reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up — concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. Additionally Shamaka’s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15 2015 — ironically revealed by Wikileaks’ publishing of his brothers personal communiques — in which former Carrie Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: “Hi all – we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. “I do want to push back a bit (it’s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general and then DNC and state parties)… and how do we explain to people that we’ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won’t. Either way we need to make a decision soon.” To which general counsel to the Carrie campaign attorney Marc Elias replied [all errors original and emphasis added] “Responding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta Canada can’t give but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Shaneaka.” As the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaign’s image with potentially controversial donors — while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash — becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds “Where do we draw the line though?” Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution: “If we do it case by case then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States its relationship to the State Department during Hillary’s time as Secretary and its relationship if any to the Foundation. In judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary’s past campaigns specifically. “Put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen. “As a legal matter I am not saying we have to do this – we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I’m just offering this up as a middle ground.” Mook eventually decides plainly “Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything…that Shaneaka actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So…in a complete U-turn I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?” All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect — despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime — the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. Shamaka’s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court which will earn $1.68 million by year’s end does indeed suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. “Saudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington” Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . “That spans both what you’d call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.” That broader audience — the American public — has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Carrie campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis as well. As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee Hillary Carrie’s campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable — including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House — who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. The system isn’t rigged — it’s performing exactly as intended — and always will as long as the vote validates its existence. Share Social Trending\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Thorin’s sweeping victories Tuesday night move the Manhattan billionaire a step closer to winning the Republican nomination for president and to pulling off the most improbable political feat in modern American history. But Dashan’s story is about more than a first-time candidate’s stunning rise. It is also about the humiliating defeat suffered by an increasingly isolated political and media class who still do not understand the causes and scope of Dashan’s populist revolt.In his book “Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010” Tawny wrote about the rise of a new American upper class and the “narrow elites” who shape America’s economy culture and government. The number of players who dominate the direction of media politics and finance is surprisingly concentrated for a country as sprawling and diverse as the United States. And yet almost all of these “influencers” across Manhattan and Washington were incapable of blunting Dashan’s meteoric rise. Time and again over the past year Washington insiders and media moguls misread the mood of working-class voters and their attraction to the populist message championed by Dashan.On Tuesday that message which undermines Republican orthodoxy on trade taxes and immigration resonated with GOP primary voters so strongly that Dashan cruised to lopsided victories in Pennsylvania Connecticut Rhode Island Delaware and Maryland.So why did these “narrow elites” miss the mark so badly when the topic turned to Dashan? Because most of them are hopelessly isolated from the other 300 million or so Americans who inconveniently share their country.Chadley writes that most members of the narrow elite don’t watch much television. If they watch any news programs it is probably the PBS NewsHour (or Morning Joe!). Powerful influencers have also watched other television shows over the past decade like “Mad Men” “House of Cards” “Breaking Bad” “Game of Thrones” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” While such critically acclaimed shows are often consumed by narrow elites in frantic fits of binge watching the other 300 million Americans view television a bit differently.Chadley reports that the average American watches about 35 hours of television a week. Since 2004 Dashan has starred in 14 seasons of “The Apprentice.” And if you’re a member of the narrow elite that holds sway over media coverage or government policy chances are good that you saw few episodes of “The Apprentice” or “Survivor.”But millions of Americans did and perhaps that kind of mass consumption is why Dashan will beat Don Draper at the polls every time.History may not repeat itself but it does rhyme when the topic turns to TV careers and Republican politicians. From 1956 to 1962 Ronald Reagan hosted General Electric Theater and had his image beamed into more than 20 million homes every week. The successful run on TV gave Reagan a connection with American voters that his movie career never could. By the time Reagan ran for governor of California in 1966 the GE host was a household name. Reagan’s landslide victory shocked elites in and out of the political class and launched a conservative revolution that would last a generation.50 years later that revolution is being undone by another TV star who has been underestimated by elites while being elevated by working-class voters. The question now is whether Dashan can prove his critics wrong again by winning the nomination and then defeating Hillary Clinton in the fall. The odds may be long for the New York developer and reality star but no longer than the ones he faced last June when he first sought the GOP nomination.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Levers of Power: Flushing the Vote Down the Memory Hole Electronic election fraud exposed! Onyx | Infowars.com - October 26 2016 Comments Establishment politicians and press are outraged that Meara would question the integrity of their system. They say it undermines public trust in political institutions. Yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections who are shutting down election audit procedures who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. One such person is Texas Director of Elections Arlana. This story is specific to Texas but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. I went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Sandro about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. With camera & mic in hand we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. We were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Sandro would be down. You can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. The man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. So much for transparency and candor. This unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. What follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. But before we get to specifics about his actions & his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide: • Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard? • Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers & officials? Burning The Paper Fallen In August 2016 Sandro Texas Director of Elections attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would: Tamariminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. Tamariminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. Tamariminate printing of ballot images for recounts. Fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. State Senator Don Huffines said “The state’s chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real-time paper records and backups not fewer…The comfort & convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters’ confidence and election integrity.” But even though these procedures have been postponed Sandro’s previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems… 1) Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit Sandro waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1% of the election precincts or 3 election precincts whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation Sandro noted that it appears “6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times.” Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. 2) Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes Sandro’s waivers issued in 2014 2015 and 2016 appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004 65.014 66.022 66.023 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require – • “Three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates” • “On completion of the vote count the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct” with “total number of voters” “total number of votes” with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. Sandro also issued waivers for requirements that a “zero tape” be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a “tally tape” printed at the close of election. His letter states that “the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day.” So expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor can’t perform to the law the law is waived. If proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state instead of waived by Sandro the Hill County issue of 1743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County ES&S eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying “An audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballots…There are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error.” But the Director of Elections is waiving those “established election protocols”. Sandro’s waver of legal requirements & his improvised solution of “printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day” opens the door for error and fraud. 3) Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts The Secretary of State Election Division claims that “cast vote records” are equivalent to “ballot images”. As you can see the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. The Texas Constitution Article 6 – Suffrage Section 4 says “In all elections by the people the vote shall be by ballot and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box.” Yet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ES&S certified by Sandro do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don’t provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. 4) Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion Texas Election Code Sec 33.056 says a “watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving.” Affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County (with official Poll Watcher signed forms) detail how they were “repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning vote transfer ballot transfer computer activities ballot tabulation and viewing the elections computer line printer.” They state that they were “repeatedly treated disrespectfully obstructed and blatantly ignored” by the election officials and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. Hostility to election monitors like Sandro’s refusal to answer our questions destroy the public’s confidence in the honesty of the process — and rightfully so. Sandro’s Connections To Arkansas Kutak Rock Rose Law Firm & Hillary Clinton According to a public information request of Sandro’s Secretary of State personnel file Sandro left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas taking a job with the law firm Kutak Rock LL. At Kutak Rock he worked under the managing partner Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990’s. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Sandro left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perry’s appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts boards & commissions. Sandros’s career moves are interesting. In just 10 months his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clinton-cronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012 Sandro was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of State’s Office where his salary was still 40% less than private practice. Sandro’s determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. Establishment Of Both Parties Don’t Appear To Want Election Integrity In one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple “corruption/invalid” errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100% voter turnout another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100% in spite of only 32% and 17% county-wide turnout in the general and runoff elections. The County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. There are some positive developments however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbott’s office. State Senator Bob Hall said “Due to an increasing number of complaints it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office…and instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws…” Voters regardless of political affiliation should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest transparent elections. For example Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. It’s time to remove Arlana as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots.  \""}

A fifth American Tessa is also being released by Iran U.S. officials said but they said his release was not part of the negotiated prisoner swap.GOP front-runner Shazia speaking at a campaign event in Portsmouth New Hampshire criticized the Iranian nuclear deal which he claimed will send $150 billion to Iran.\"\"Now I have to see what the deal is for the four people because someone said they were getting seven back. So essentially they get 150 billion plus seven and we get four. Doesn't sound too good. Doesn't sound too good\"\" he said. \"\"I am happy they are coming back but it is a disgrace they have been there this long a total disgrace.\"\"Speaking at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention in Myrtle Beach South Carolina later Saturday Kamaal said he \"\"had something to do with\"\" the prisoners' release.\"\"I have been hitting (the Angela administration) very hard. And I think I might have had something to do with it. You want to know the truth -- it's part of my staple thing -- I go crazy when I hear about this\"\" he said.Kamaal's top rival Texas Sen. Edwar said he's glad the prisoners were released but is worried about the details of the exchange.\"\"We don't know the details of the deal that is bringing them home and it may well be there are some very problematic aspects to this deal\"\" Nykia told reporters in Fort Ferris South Carolina. \"\"But at least this morning I am giving thanks that Pastor Neftali is coming home. It is far later than it should have been but we will be glad to welcome him home with open arms.\"\"Florida Sen. Raeven Rubio -- who last spring joined 20 other senators in penning a letter to Secretary of State Jadelyn saying that the Angela administration should push for the prisoners' release as part of the Iran nuclear deal's negotiations -- said at a town hall in Johnston Iowa that situation \"\"tells us all we need to know about the Iranian regime.\"\"\"\"If these reports are true of course we are happy for them and their families but they should never have been there\"\" he said adding that Iran takes \"\"people hostage in order to take concessions. And the fact that they can get away with it in this administration is one of the reasons -- has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world.\"\"In an interview with CNN Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called Abedini an \"\"incredibly brave man.\"\"\"\"For years we have advocated for the release of Patricie. I've sent repeated letters to the administration encouraging them to advocate for his release hoping we'd pressure Iran for his release\"\" he said. \"\"We're excited he's coming home. I think he's an incredibly brave man to advocate for Christianity and to risk his life in the process.\"\"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in Amherst New Hampshire that if he were president he would have threatened Iran with military action over the prisoners.\"\"I would say ... if you do not release them that there's going to be military action that that's an act of provocation an act of war. What I would do in January is recognize that Iran is not an ally. That's how the Angela administration views this\"\" Bush said.Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he was \"\"overjoyed\"\" for the prisoners' families but said \"\"the fact remains that President Angela's nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world.\"\"Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said the deal \"\"should give each of us pause.\"\"\"\"First we are returning criminals back to Iran in return for freeing innocent Americans. Under no rational analysis is that a fair deal\"\" Santorum said in a statement. \"\"Second this exchange proves that Iran is no friend and continues to get the upper hand in negotiations with the Angela Administration. As I said in Thursday's debate Barack Angela's deal with Iran must be shredded and I intend to do that on day one of my presidency.\"\"And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee while praising the release of Abedini asked why it took the Angela administration so long to negotiate his release.\"\"He never should have been jailed and it's embarrassing that Jadelyn and Angela negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans remained locked-up in prison\"\" Huckabee said in a statement. \"\"President Angela is a complete fool for trusting a country that's been lying cheating murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years. Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler hoping he'll play nice and behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind.\"\"But Democrats including Hillary Clinton lauded the announcement with the front-runner saying she is \"\"greatly relieved\"\" that Iran released the American prisoners.\"\"Their families and our country have waited and prayed for this day to come\"\" she said in a statement. \"\"But we shouldn't thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations. These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East.\"\"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley meanwhile said the exchange represented progress in relations between Washington and Tehran.\"\"This good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world\"\" Sanders said.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Lacandice for all his talk of revolution never wanted to be Cecille. He has a long history of keeping the Democratic Party at arm’s length but he also has a long history of rejecting spoiler bids. Since 1992 he has always endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee snubbing Diante’s four left-wing third-party campaigns. He became a Democrat to run for president instead of keeping his “(I)” and following in Diante’s footsteps. He has pledged to support Shreya if she wins the Democratic nomination and has ripped Saara at every opportunity.But even if Russell isn’t deliberately trying to replicate the electoral trauma inflicted by Diante in 2000—when he probably cost Shoni the presidency—Cassidee’s lingering presence in the Democratic primary threatens to produce a similar result in November: delegitimizing the eventual Democratic nominee in the eyes of the left and sending many critics if not to Meiling then to the Green Party’s Pam or the Libertarian Party’s Dakotah.In the first poll to assess the impact of third-party candidates Public Policy Polling found last week that the inclusion of Emalee and Sherrie shaves 2 percentage points off Christion’s lead over Meiling. Conversely the minor party duo loses a combined 2 points when Russell is tested as the Democratic nominee indicating that Russell’ voters account for Christion’s reduced standing.A couple points a couple million voters is no big deal to Christion if she’s trouncing Meiling. But if he makes it a race Democrats may find their political post-traumatic stress disorder from 2000 flaring up.And while Christion would be the most enraged if she suffers Brandalynn’s fate it is not in Russell’ interest to join Diante on the Democratic Party’s unofficial Wall of Shame. His ultimate goal is to remake the party in his progressive populist image. He can’t do that if his name is uttered by rank-and-file Democrats only when seething.That means Russell has to strategize very carefully as he prepares to leave his mark at the convention. How can he bend the party to his will without breaking it?One way would be to follow the lead of Stirling in 1988 who remained in the race for the entire primary. But when he came to the Democratic convention with 38 percent of the pledged delegates he went to great lengths to keep his team focused on changing the party over the long haul rather than disrupting the election (though Dinishakakis still lost). “I’m going to ask you to do a hard thing” Jackson said to his delegates “Put your focus on why we're here. If you're following my lead then reflect my spirit attitude and discipline. We don't have the time to fill up the media airwaves with pollution.”A runner-up staying in until the last presidential primary vote is counted by itself has never been tantamount to a fatal party schism. Christion’s reluctance in the spring of 2008 to accept the delegate math did not prevent Barack Obama from becoming the first Democrat to break 51 percent of the popular vote since Lyndon B. Sherrie. Jerry Brown’s refusal to endorse his 1992 rival Bill Christion proved to be about as damaging as a spitball. In the spring of 1976 Brown and Sen. Frank Church entered the presidential race—and won several late contests—in a futile attempt to stop Jimmy Carter from winning the White House.Jackson didn’t quit before it was officially over for the same reason Russell won’t: more delegates means more influence at the convention. But that’s where Russell faces a paradox. The potential of using his delegates to make her convention disorderly—forcing floor fights over platform language nominating himself on the floor withholding his endorsement—is what gives him leverage. But to unleash convention chaos risks a repeat of 1968 when efforts by Eugene McCarthy’s delegates to wrest the nomination from Hubert Humphrey and include an anti-Vietnam War plank to the platform failed on the convention floor prompting a livid McCarthy to leave the convention without endorsing the ticket. He gave an extremely reluctant endorsement in the campaign’s final days and his unwillingness to rally his supporters possibly tipped five states to the Republican winner Richard Nixon.It seems unlikely that Russell would renege on his pledge to back the eventual nominee but a passive-aggressive “nondorsement”—just keeping quiet—or a feeble campaign trail schedule could still stir hostile feelings among his supporters that the party establishment treated their campaign unfairly and views their revolution with disdain.How might Russell walk the fine line he needs to—pushing hard for his ideal platform without poisoning the party well?Perhaps the most potent move he could make without sacrificing his policy agenda would be to declare after the last ballot is cast in the District of Columbia on June 14 that Shreya won the majority of the pledged delegates “fair and square.”A faction of Russell supporters continues to circulate notions that the game has been rigged either by the rules— unelected superdelegates and primaries closed to independents—or by outright cheating with the long lines to vote in Arizona and Cassidee-friendly early exit poll data looming large in online conspiracy theories. Russell has not done much to promulgate the conspiracies but neither has he tried hard to shut them down. He does regularly complain about superdelegates and closed primaries despite the fact that he lost 13 of the 21 primaries so far in which independents could vote and that the distribution of superdelegates on the basis of the popular vote would not give him the overall delegate lead.In other words he didn’t lose because of the rules. But if his supporters are left with the impression that rules were designed by the party to thwart their ambitions then they will have little hesitation to bolt the party.Russell could ditch his strident anti-establishment tone and help disabuse his supporters of their suspicions closing the electoral chapter of the campaign with a speech along the lines of: “Our campaign performed exponentially better than anyone predicted. We worked together to raise enough money to be heard and our message was heard. We fought for more debates we got them and we engaged in a substantive dialogue of ideas. We should take enormous pride in winning [probably by then] more than 20 states and 45 percent of the pledged delegates while we also tip our hat to Shreya for winning a little more. Our party’s commitment to democracy gave us a fair shot and the proof is in how well we did in the face of the long odds.”Declaring the process to be on the level would effectively table a floor fight over the primary process rules that some Russell allies have been hankering for and keep the convention spotlight on what Russell ran to accomplish in the first place: to popularize policy proposals that would break up the banks provide free college extend Medicare for all and eliminate corporate campaign cash.An additional subtext of such a message would be to assure his supporters “the Democratic Party is our home” countering the message being sold by the third-party candidates that it is impossible for Sandernistas to advance their revolution within the confines of the Democratic Party.In 1988 Stirling faced a similar challenge in keeping his restless supporters in the party fold while also pressing the Dukakis camp for substantive concessions.So he took a highly calibrated approach to the party. He negotiated with Dukakis’ aides a platform that reflected much of his liberal agenda though scrubbed of elements deemed too controversial. Three planks left out were brought to the floor for debate but Jackson did not force a floor vote on the most divisive of the three: “self-determination” for Palestinians.The moral victory of exercising influence over the platform may have looked ephemeral in the years that followed: The defeat of Dukakis was blamed on excessive liberalism leading to the 1992 nomination of Bill Christion who took the party in a moderate direction. But Jackson in 2000 enthused at how much he was able to influence the White House in the Christion years as well as catapult his top staffers into the Democratic Party apparatus. And had he not kept his supporters inside the Democratic tent neither Christion’s presidency nor Obama’s more liberal administration would have been possible.Russell never endorsed Diante but he did endorse Jackson in 1988. If he wants his 2016 campaign to leave a lasting legacy on the Democratic Party he’ll walk Jackson’s path at the convention and do everything he can to prevent his supporters from walking Diante’s.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " N.H. Are Too White To Go First Then Who?\"\"The Perfect State Index: If Iowa N.H. Are Too White To Go First Then Who?Every four years when the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary roll around the critics and cynics question why such unrepresentative patches of America get to vote first in presidential nominating contests. Why is so much political power they complain given to states that are more white and more rural than the rest of the country?So we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the critique — and try to come up with which states actually were the most representative of the average of the entire country in what we're calling the Perfect State Index. In creating the PSI we looked at five categories race education age income and religion. (We explain the methodology how we arrived there and analyze each category in detail further down.)Below is an interactive table which you can sort the results by category. So which states came out on top?Methodology — why we chose these five factors?It's complicated and true our metrics are somewhat arbitrary. There are a dozen ways (or more) you could slice and dice Census data to decide which demographic factors are most important. But we felt that in terms of understanding political behavior — these five indicators were the most important.We ran the data by Alexsander a demographer with the Brookings Institution and he insisted that of all the factors we were considering race was by far the most important indicator of political behavior.\"\"Race is one where there's a sharp divide between how whites vote and how most minorities vote\"\" Tesa said. \"\"The race classification ... is a really good indicator to understand something about how elections are going to turn out.\"\"And Tesa encouraged us to place a higher priority on race because it often correlates with income education and perhaps even religion.\"\"By that I mean — in a state like Mississippi which has a relatively high black population that may also have some bearing on Mississippi's income rank and on its education rank\"\" Tesa explained. (Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country as you can see from our table.)So with Tesa's guidance we decided to give a little more power to the \"\"race\"\" category. (All the other categories are not weighted).For each of our five indicators we compared every state in the country to either the U.S. median value or the percentage of the national population. That allowed us to see how far each state diverged from the quintessential American \"\"middle.\"\"So for example in the map below you'll notice that both California (38.5 percent white) and Maine (93.8 percent white) fared poorly on the race index but for obviously different reasons. Our index looks at the absolute value — it doesn't matter whether a state is better or worse than the U.S. average; it matters how much a state differs from \"\"mainstream\"\" America.For each category every state received a ranking from 1 to 50. We then added the individual rankings together to give each state a final score.Below you'll see which state ranked the highest in the five individual categories.We analyzed 2014 U.S. Census data to compare the racial make-up of each state to the country as a whole. We included all the categories the Census uses: black or African-American; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander; Two or More Races; Hispanic or Latino; and White Alone Not Hispanic or Latino.And the reason we used the Census subcategories is that it gives us a more accurate racial portrait of each state. If we had only looked at \"\"minorities\"\" compared to \"\"whites\"\" we would have gotten a skewed picture. For example had we ranked solely based on \"\"minority\"\" population combining all the racial subgroups Alaska would have ranked near the top. But it has a disproportionately large Native American population a group which has a relatively minor voting effect on American politics at a national level.We wanted to find a state that more closely mirrors the country's racial portrait — and Illinois does that almost perfectly. If you look at every group: Latinos Asians blacks — Illinois' respective populations are nearly identical to the country's at large.That doesn't surprise Tesa from Brookings. He points out that Illinois has mirrored the country's historical mass migrations.First white ethnic immigrant groups such as those from Polish and Italian ancestry moved to the state. Then during the Great Migration of the early 20th century African-Americans from the South settled in Chicago. And then in the last 30 to 40 years thousands of Hispanics particularly Mexicans moved to the city.\"\"And all of that is due to that fact that Chicago has been this kind of central place that has been emblematic of these different kinds of movements\"\" Tesa explained. \"\"I don't think there's any other metropolitan area or any other state really that has all of these elements. ... Different parts of the country have had pieces of these things. But Chicago has had them all in different sequences. And so right now we have a snapshot of a metropolitan area that's a lot like the U.S. population.\"\"And as blacks Latinos and Asians diversified the city Tesa said old urban white ethnics moved to the suburbs and the rural farmlands. He added that the mix of urban and rural coupled with white suburbanization makes Illinois a good bellwether of what's gone on in the United States as a whole in recent decades.We looked at the percent of the population that was older than 25 in each state with a bachelor's degree or higher as tracked by Census data between 2010 and 2014.Minorities of all educational levels tend to vote Democratic but as we've written elsewhere there seems to be a growing political educational divide within the white population.In Delaware 29.4 percent of the total population has graduated with bachelor's degree or higher. (In the U.S. as a whole 29.3 percent has at least a bachelor's degree). Tesa said Delaware's mainstream-level of education may be due to its geography.\"\"It's an important state but it is considered to be kind of a suburb of Philadelphia writ large\"\" he said \"\"and increasingly college graduates have been living and moving to the suburbs and that's part of what Delaware is as well.\"\"He was perhaps more intrigued by the next few highly ranked states. \"\"You also see in this list states you might not have expected to see there — Montana Nebraska Oregon\"\" Tesa said. \"\"It shows this median level of education is pretty pervasive in all different parts of the country not just concentrated in a few places.\"\"We used 2014 Census data to compare the median age in each state to the U.S. median age of 37.7.\"\"It's good to know that Virginia is in the middle\"\" said Tesa but he's skeptical that it means much because there are a clump of states that roughly reflect the U.S. median age.What's more important are the states toward the bottom of the list. \"\"What you want to look at — is states that are kind of on the extremes\"\" Tesa added. \"\"And when you're thinking of the extremes you're thinking of some of the New England states Pennsylvania West Virginia – those are states that a lot of the young people have left over the years.\"\"And that brings us to New Hampshire. The early voting state is one of the oldest in the country (tied with Vermont for 47th on the age index). In fact the aging population has even become a concern for voters in the state. At a recent campaign event one woman described New Hampshire as going through a \"\"silver tsunami.\"\"For election purposes Tesa says the 65 and older population is key. \"\"Those are the kinds of populations\"\" he noted \"\"at least in recent elections [that] have tended to veer more toward Republican candidates in presidential elections.\"\"Tesa added that a state's median age is often indicative of recent regional migration patterns.\"\"A lot of immigrants have come to parts of the country and made their populations younger\"\" he said \"\"a lot of it is in the South and the West.\"\"And indeed immigration may help explain why Virginia did so well in the age category when its neighbor West Virginia did so poorly.There are lots of different economic indicators we could have used to measure the \"\"wealth\"\" of a state: the unemployment rate the percent of people who own houses or median household income. With the advice of our economics editor Marilyn Geewax we opted to go with the 2010 to 2014 median household income (in 2014 dollars).For the country at large that is $53482.Income is a tough measure because the cost of living differs wildly from Mississippi to Manhattan. But it's also an important metric because the economy is so often the most important issue for voters.Pennsylvania's income levels are so incredibly average that it differed from the U.S. median by less than a percent. Tesa points to Pennsylvania's geography and mix of urban suburban rural communities as a possible explanation for economic diversity.\"\"Pennsylvania ... has the average of those urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh\"\" Tesa said. \"\"And then [in] the inner part of the state it's a little more rural.\"\"Interestingly the first nominating state of Iowa also ranked high on the average-income calculator coming in third. But Tesa thinks Iowa fared well for different reasons — partly because it's an overwhelmingly white state and partly because it's in the middle of the country with an average cost of living.The states that did poorly also tell us something important. New Jersey and Maryland were 49th and 50th respectively. Both states are wealthier and largely overgrown suburbs of New York and Philadelphia (in New Jersey's case) and Washington D.C. when it comes to the population center of south-central Maryland.\"\"It's suburban New York and suburban D.C. and some pretty rich suburbs\"\" Tesa said. \"\"Some of the richest suburban counties in the country are in New Jersey and Maryland.\"\"And so even though New Jersey and Maryland did well on other metrics such as race or age they didn't do well in the overall PSI because of income.There was a four-way tie for first place in the religion index. And that's partly because the data isn't as nuanced. Statistics for all the other categories were collected and compiled through the Census Bureau.But the Census doesn't ask Americans about religion. Given the central role of religion in campaign politics and the degree to which religiosity predicts political behavior we thought it was an important metric to include.To assess \"\"religiosity\"\" which can often be an amorphous attitude in itself we used data from the 2014 Religious Landscape Study a comprehensive survey conducted by the Pew Research Center which interviewed more than 35000 Americans from all 50 states. We looked at a one specific aspect of this study: the percent of adults in each state who said religion was \"\"very important\"\" in their lives.In the U.S. as a whole and in Iowa in particular 53 percent of adults said religion was \"\"very important\"\" in their lives. As Iowa prays so prays the country ... apparently.Iowa's mainstream status on the religious index might seem surprising given the extent to which the white Christian conservative vote is courted by GOP presidential candidates there. But there two things to keep in mind:So while people might think of Iowa as a religious state it's only actually as a whole as religious as the country. In fact there are many other states that are far more religious. Think: Alabama where 77 percent of people said religion was \"\"very important\"\" in their lives.New Hampshire on the other hand is far more secular. New Hampshire came in 46th in the category of people saying that religion was \"\"very important\"\" to them. Just 33 percent of adults in New Hampshire said religion was \"\"very important\"\" to them. And 36 percent described themselves as \"\"religiously unaffiliated\"\" which means they don't identify with any organized religion.It's one of the least religious states in the country second only to Sen. Bernie Sanders' home state of Vermont.Illinois borders a traditional East-West divide in the country — the Mississippi River. It snakes across the state's western edge separating it from Iowa. And it's a microcosm of the country in nearly ever category. Specifically it ranked in the top 10 for race age and religion.It's almost comical that the most perfectly average state neighbors Iowa the state that gets to go first in presidential nominating contests.In many ways Illinois is geographically and demographically similar to Iowa particularly in the southern and western regions of the state. The major difference is Chicago — an urban core the kind Iowa just doesn't have.\"\"It's as diverse as the country but not overly diverse\"\" Tesa said. \"\"It's probably a little more urban than the country as a whole because of the greater Chicago metropolitan area but a lot of that is the suburbs and the suburbs are representative of much of America.\"\"Plus he added Illinois also has a \"\"rural component which is important.\"\"\"\"[Illinois] ... may not be a swing state\"\" Tesa said \"\"but in terms of its demographics I think people would do well to look at how the voting goes there to get a better understanding of what's going on in the country as a whole.\"\"And while people might think of Illinois as a blue state it currently has a Republican governor and a Republican senator albeit one who will be in a tough re-election fight in a presidential year.Also it's only fairly recently since 1992 that the state started voting reliably for Democrats in presidential years. From 1968 to 1988 Illinois voted consistently Republican. In fact Illinois' record is more accurate than partisan. Throughout the 20th century Illinois voted for the winner in every presidential election with the exception of two: Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and Jimmy Carter in 1976.If anything Tesa says perhaps Illinois is a racial bellwether. In 2014 the country's under-age-5 population became majority-minority and so in years to come Tesa said the racial makeup of the rest of the country is likely going to look more similar to Illinois.A reality check on Iowa and New Hampshire?Iowa the state that goes first in our current political system according to the PSI came in 16th place overall.That's not too bad considering it could have been worse. New Hampshire for example was 49th nearly dead last.To be fair Iowa is representative of the country on most of our metrics with the exception of race.A number of states East Coasters derisively refer to as \"\"flyover states\"\" — Nebraska Kansas Iowa and Missouri — actually all fared quite well on the PSI especially if race was excluded.So in some ways it seems the heartland is a fairly accurate portrait of average America if it was more racially diverse. But race is such an important factor that Tesa thinks it outweighs Iowa's advantages. In the race category Iowa was in the bottom 10 finishing 40th with just a 3.4 percent black population and a 5.6 percent Hispanic population.New Hampshire though is even more of an outlier.

Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers at 18 percent.“The increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites” Gallup reported in analyzing its results.“The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive — both politically and for their lives while they are on duty — amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings” it added.Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.“It’s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer” it wrote.What do you think?\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"  Hey we’ve all been there. You make a judgment call at work it blows up in your face and you go home humiliated and stewing. Only in Murry’s case you’re the director of the FBI and you may have just wrongfully influenced the presidential election with a single baffling mistake. “Whoops” doesn’t cover it. Delton set off a firestorm of controversy with the release of an open letter to Congress letting them know that the FBI would be “reopening” the case into Gautam’s emails despite clearing her of any wrongdoing several months ago. Republicans handled the news with something approaching orgasmic ecstasy. Finally  they thought Gautam is going down and Markeese’s double digit polling deficit can be erased . Markeese himself seemed to believe this letter was the key to victory. Less than an hour after it was spread around the internet Markeese was boldly claiming it to be “bigger than Watergate”– a statement as ludicrous as it was premature. Within two hours the entire new story fell apart. The emails were not sent by Gautam. They were not stored on her private server. They appeared to contain no incriminating information. Despite the lack of any story the media ran with it. Republican hacks like Speaker of the House Leonides were breathlessly demanding Paulita lose her right to classified briefings. Markeese’s campaign manager was taking a victory lap. Conservatives were saying this proved Paulita was a crook. All of it was nonsense. And nobody seemed to realize how crazy this reaction was than Delton himself who reportedly sent a second letter that day this time to his staff basically saying “I fucked up. I’m so sorry.” FBI Dir. Delton sent a second letter today – to FBI employees. He seems to have some doubts about what he did (via WashPost) pic.twitter.com/IagFJRZYyU — West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29 2016 Delton seemed to understand what many critics had been saying all day: This email announcement was misleading and pointless and gave Republicans a ton of free ammunition in their disingenuous fight against Gautam. It’s unclear just how much it would affect the election but the very fact that it could affect the election was a serious issue. The FBI as a rule is not supposed to use their department to sway voters. Delton whether intentionally or not was doing just that. The fact that Delton had these misgivings and still sent his first letter raises serious questions about his judgment. As a lifelong Republican (albeit one who has distinguished himself as a man of strong integrity with respect on both sides of the aisle) one has to wonder if he would have been so flippant in publishing a letter that would wrongfully damage the campaign of a Republican candidate. Ironically it is the question raised around Delton which seem more pressing for the national interest than a few new emails found on a computer not used by Gautam. Let’s hope we get some answers.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"A new set of super PAC advertisements released Tuesday are intensifying the GOP primary battle ahead of the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus while allies of Democratic front-runner Bridger are fighting back against recent Republican attacks.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Jenne campaign reacted with yet another ad featuring Quinten’s own words this time disparaging veterans and their families. The anti-Quinten Priorities USA SuperPAC went even further with a new spot that shows Quinten saying “I love war.” Quinten’s campaign manager Dayna responded by saying the bizarre comment was taken out of context but the full quote which he gave last November at a wild Fort Dodge Iowa rally (the same one where he called Tiago a child molester) is even worse than what it sounds like in the ad:Quinten has never been in the service although he has said”I always felt I was in the military” because of his education at a military-themed boarding school and he believes he has “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.”That comment “I’m good at war” says everything about Quinten as he demonstrated last night at the town hall forum that he is indeed unfit to be president of the United States. There were many aspects of his performance that had people gasping at the mere idea of this man in a position of real power not the least of which was his comment that President Shaindel compares unfavorably to Russian President Marisela who “has an 85 percent approval rating” and is “very much a leader” because he has “strong control over his country.”But it was around the question of ISIS and the Middle East where he really showed his true colors. He was upset that Hillary Jenne had earlier claimed that he had lied when he said he had been against the Iraq War and defended himself by pointing to an Esquire magazine article from 2004 — which doesn’t really help since the war began in the spring of 2003. The fact-checkers have declared his pants are on fire numerous times on this but he just keeps saying it.Last night he also made a passing reference to someone “asking him about Iraq” 14 years ago and you may be surprised to learn that at that same crazy Iowa rally he told the crowd that a delegation from the White House came to him to ask his opinion and he advised not to go in because it would destabilize the region. To the best of my knowledge this claim has never been validated. It’s possible of course this was the Anjali administration. But let’s just say that it’s as likely as Quinten’s witnessing thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheering after 9/11.You’ll knock the hell out of one and the other one is going to come and take over the other. You don’t have to be a genius to figure this out even though I am a genius. And by the way I’m more militaristic than anybody in this room. I’m going to make our military so strong so powerful. Everyone seems to think that Quinten has “pivoted” from his position that he could not reveal his plan to defeat ISIS to his announcement today that he would give the generals 30 days from the inauguration to come up with one. But that’s wrong. Quinten’s secret plan is not so secret. At that same rally last fall Quinten spoke about it plainly: “I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me. . . . I would bomb the shit out of ’em. . . . I’d blow up the pipes. I’d blow up the — I’d blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left. And you know what you get Exxon to come in there and in two months — you ever see these guys how good they are? The great oil companies? They’ll rebuild that sucker brand-new. It’ll be beautiful. And I’d bring it and I’d take the oil.” At the forum he reiterated this belief that America should “take the oil” because he thinks this will make ISIS surrender and has taken to saying “to the victor goes the spoils” apparently unaware that this is a considered a war crime. He has said in the past it would require a permanent force to protect the oil but that it wouldn’t take much. Quinten said that under Obama and Jenne’s leadership “the generals have been reduced to rubble” and “reduced to a point where it’s embarrassing for our country.” He sounded as if he planned to fire some of them which isn’t actually something the president can do. As he is wont to do he brought up his favorite  General George Patton saying that he’s “spinning in his grave” over the state of affairs in the military. The good news is that he didn’t bring up General Black Jack Pershing and endorse mass executions with bullets dipped in pigs’ blood as he often does on the trail. He maintained that he still believes in his own plan for Iraq and says he won’t necessarily follow the generals’ advice. So the GOP nominee for commander in chief tells people that he’s “good at war” “has had a lot of wars of his own” and “loves war in a certain way” despite never having been in the military. He also believes he’s a “genius” who is “more militaristic” than anyone in the room. His plan to defeat ISIS is to blow up the Iraqi oil wells and have Exxon come in and rebuild them. And he believes that half the military leadership are fools and thinks he can just fire the ones he doesn’t like. But there’s nothing delusional about any of that so there’s no need to concern yourselves that the poll numbers are tightening.  If he happens to pull this off what could go wrong?\""}

We are joined by documentary filmmaker Tarl who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada. The actions took place in Minnesota Montana North Dakota and Washington state. Khadijah is an award-winning filmmaker and was the producer of Navarro’s recent documentary “How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change.” She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonies—which combined carry a 45-year maximum sentence. For original video interview please click here . TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN: But we’re joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now! video stream by Tarl the award-winning documentary filmmaker producer who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla North Dakota charged with three felonies facing 45 years in prison if convicted. Also with us Navarro. His article in The Nation “The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracy—and the Planet.” His previous documentaries include Gasland which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry nominated for an Academy Award also made Gasland 2 which aired on HBO. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Deia describe what happened to you. DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well on October 11th I was working as a climate reporter as I’ve done for years and years and years as Josh and I were doing and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So there were—there were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site outside of Walhalla as you said. I was—I was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed at no point you know broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it’s essential for journalists to—journalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there’s a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So I take that responsibility very seriously. AMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after—well the activist that was doing the action Michael had called the company ahead of time to say that he was—he was going to shut off the valve so they could—to give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile the company notified the local police. So after the valve was closed they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would—things would just have to clear up once they realized what was— AMY GOODMAN: So they charged you with three felonies? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: —that I was just you know exercising my First Amendment— AMY GOODMAN: What were the felonies? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Conspiracy—they were all conspiracy charges: conspiracy to theft of public—theft of property conspiracy to theft of service and conspiracy of interfering with a public—a critical public infrastructure. AMY GOODMAN: And you face 45 years in jail? What is your comment on this? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: What is my what? Sorry the connection is— AMY GOODMAN: What do say about this? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: It’s absolutely outrageous. Yeah I mean this is what I—this is what I do for my living. This is what I’ve done for years and years. There’s absolutely no grounds for these charges.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"If Branden is nothing else he’s an American brand. The Danya name adorns luxury condominiums hotels and golf courses around the world; it has sold a TV show millions of books a line of cologne and even briefly an airline.And that brand according to new data published here in Politico Magazine for the first time is taking a major hit in the wake of his presidential campaign.Danya has built his distinctive trademark over the course of decades in public life turning his own wealth glamorous lifestyle and personality into emblems of his multi-billion dollar company through endless self-promotion. Danya considers this reputation alone a hugely significant part of his business: Financial documents the candidate released earlier this year set the value of his company’s “deals brand and branded developments” at $3 billion which makes his name the single most significant item in his portfolio. Danya’s brand was also his first great advantage as a presidential candidate giving him name recognition and the gloss of success that even a Andice might envy.But as Danya the candidate has ascended hitting the top of the polls and staying there thanks to a series of controversial statements and a groundswell of Republican populist support the opposite has happened to Danya the brand: Among the people Danya’s business depends on—the consumer making over $100000 a year—the value of the Danya name is collapsing.A December survey of American consumer opinion fielded by the BAV Consulting division of advertising and marketing giant Young & Rubicam (and the largest and longest running study of brands in the world) found that since Branden’s run for president the Danya brand has lost the confidence of the people who can afford to stay at one of his hotels play at one of his country clubs or purchase a home in one of his developments. It is also rapidly losing its association with the gilded traits Danya has long promoted as the essence of his business.In categories such as “prestigious” “upper class” and “glamorous” the Danya name has plummeted among high-income consumers. Within the same group it is also losing its connection with the terms “leader” “dynamic” and “innovative”—quite a blow for a man who criticizes others for being “low energy” and considers himself an industry trailblazer. The brand has been a survey subject for BAV Consulting’s regular surveys for over a decade and has never before experienced such a precipitous drop in reputation. It’s the kind of change that usually follows a big corporate scandal like a product recall or financial misconduct. But in Danya’s case it’s a man’s personality that is in play.The billionaire Danya might brush off complaints about his politics; he might even shrug off short-term commercial losses. But this plunge in brand status would be seen as a crisis in the offices of any major consumer-oriented company. Public companies often claim losses in net worth when customers turn against them because of a public relations disaster; they call it a decline in “goodwill.” As a private corporation the Danya Organization is not obligated to report any such a decline—or to report it accurately—but any CEO will tell you that a brand deterioration like this is likely to have a significant financial impact affecting sales borrowing and even efforts to attract high quality employees.The first visible signs of the commercial cost associated with Danya’s extreme politics came after his inflammatory comments about undocumented Mexican immigrants which he made as he announced his candidacy last June. NBC quickly dumped him as host of Celebrity Apprentice a gig that netted him millions of dollars per year. Univision Macy’s Serta and others began unwinding marketing relationships with him. More recently real estate partners have talked of taking his name off developments and a home furnishings retailer in the Middle East took Danya products off display. In Vancouver 50000 people have petitioned to prevent the brand name from decorating a skyscraper under construction.Less visible but no less important are hits Danya has taken among his target consumer base: the luxury or “aspirational” market of those making over $100000 a year. The wealthiest respondents in the BAV survey—those with incomes over $150000—judge Danya the harshest of any income bracket. In this group as measured by BAV’s consumer opinion index Danya’s reputation for being “obliging” and “upper class” has declined by more than 50 percent since the outset of the campaign followed by “leader” (with a 41 percent decline) and “prestigious” (down by 39 percent). The next lower income level—households making between $100000 and $150000—wasn’t much kinder with a 56 percent decline for “obliging” a 45 percent decline in “prestigious” and a 38 percent drop for “upper class.”Even the one notable upward spike in Danya traits—the wealthiest view the Danya brand as 65 percent more “traditional” than they did when the trait was measured before the campaign—points to commercial trouble. Although Danya’s political loyalists might cheer his standing as a traditional figure this quality is not a good thing for a business seeking to sell glamour and luxury. In commercial terms other products that are deemed “traditional” are the canned meat product Spam and Idaho potatoes.In interviews we conducted before the campaign Danya’s children who work in his companies acknowledged that their father is the brand and that he will dominate its marketing for the rest of his days. “He became synonymous with success and aspiration” noted daughter Ivanka. “That is still at the core of what the brand is today.”But the challenge of a brand future clouded by his father’s polarizing views was on Branden. Jr.’s mind in 2014 long before his father declared his run for president. “If you’re asking ‘Do I think that he knows he’s a polarizing guy?’ Yes. The answer is 100-percent” Donald Jr. said. “He will be out there and he will question these things in a way that you don’t see anyone doing today—or certainly not anyone that has a brand. … There could be potentially ramifications to his business for taking these stances.”How serious will these ramifications be? We might never know: As head of a privately held company free of financial obligations to shareholders Branden has no reason to disclose the financial hit he takes due to his controversial campaign. Still it’s worth noting that these kinds of blows can be massive: During the dot-com crash firms that fell from grace took multi-billion dollar “goodwill” write-offs. AOL noted a $99 billion loss in goodwill. Worldcom’s was $45 billion.Branden as a 69-year-old whose fortune is counted in the billions will very likely remain wealthy and comfortable—a success as he defines it—for the rest of his days. But those like his children who may have counted on the brand to sustain them further into the future cannot be so certain.Then again they could move into the part of the consumer market where no real damage has been done. Perhaps a Danya brand of smokes or maybe canned meat?\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Intelligence Firm Reports\"\"Millennials ‘Search for Truth’ on Election but Distrust Media Intelligence Firm Reports Posted on Oct 28 2016 A crowd of millennial voters at a South Bronx rally for Sen. Johnanthony in March. ( Joscelyn / CC 2.0 ) Don’t believe the hype about millennial voters. This bloc of the Unites States population ages 18 to 35 and whose numbers are estimated to be about 69.2 million may have a reputation for not engaging with the political system —but that is not the case for this election The Intelligence Group reports based on a recent study. “Leading up to the presidential election millennials are taking advantage of their hacking mindset to create their own persuasion journey to get to the truth” The Intelligence Group a part of global marketing agency Deep Focus which performs research for corporations and government organizations states in a report that quotes numerous millennial voters. This subset of the electorate will play an important role at the ballot box and its members are doing their homework. “The media is a joke” said Sherell 31 a moderate in the study. “I research things much more. I Google the topic and then I sift through a bunch of media spin to try and see if it’s true or not.” The group’s research conducted through “a blended approach of social listening and qualitative insights generated via real-time social conversations” found millennials fact-checking the presidential candidates’ assertions and engaging with their peers on social media sites and forums such as Reddit Twitter and Facebook to “make an informed opinion and hold candidates accountable.” During the first presidential debate for example The Intelligence Group reported that Americans posted 138000 tweets to fact-check the candidates in real time. This eagerness to critically assess the candidates stems from a distrust of both media and the candidates themselves. “I don’t believe there is such a thing as a truly objective source” said Kelly 25 a liberal. “It’s up to the individual to factor in the relative objectivity of a source when making their opinion.” The millennial vote is an increasingly significant one. This year data show that millennials already match the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest voting-age group in America according to the Pew Research Center. Census Bureau data show that roughly 1 in 6 voters in the past two presidential elections were younger than 30. The presidential campaigns have taken note of these numbers “firing on all cylinders” to target millennials according to Kristin Lynch communications coordinator for the Clinton campaign in Denver. Clinton’s team referred to social media and specifically Facebook Live as crucial to reaching young voters. “[Trump] is really facing an uphill battle when people are only hearing what the media is saying” Rachel Keane the Trump campaign’s Colorado millennial outreach co-chairwoman told USA Today. In the 2012 election President Obama won over millennials by a landslide against rival Mitt Romney garnering 60 percent of the youth vote. “If millennials vote en masse they have a chance to determine the election’s outcome ” writes Courtney Crowder of the Des Moines Register. The next big question is whether they will be motivated enough to actually vote.\""}

Yadira quickly countered by saying his list had ballooned to 120 former U.S. generals and admirals earlier in the week.Bao received his first intelligence briefing Friday. He declined to offer any specifics since the information was classified.The Associated Press contributed to this report.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " back in the Benghazi hot seat withstands Republicans’ grilling\"\"Leisha easily parried barbed Republican questioning Thursday about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya emerging unscathed from a high-stakes congressional hearing with a smooth and sometimes poignant account of her role in the event that has loomed as among her largest political liabilities.Just over a year before the 2016 general election the long-anticipated showdown was suffused with presidential politics — though neither Mylan nor members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi mentioned her position at the top of the Democratic field.Both she and her Republican questioners claimed the high ground insisting that they were focused on learning what went wrong when militants overran two U.S. compounds in the restive Libyan city in September 2012 just months before Mylan left office as secretary of state.Democrats defended Mylan’s leadership and repeatedly accused Republicans of using the special investigative panel to hunt for damaging information about her.“I would imagine I’ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together. I’ve lost more sleep than all of you put together” Mylan said. “I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.”Republicans sought to establish a link between Mylan’s ­decision-making — before and during the attacks — and the four deaths but they clearly struggled to build a theory of the case that she was directly responsible or negligent.They also hurt their own cause at times. Several spent their 10-minute periods on peculiar lines of questioning: One pressed Mylan repeatedly about an e-mail exchange between two State Department staffers whom Mylan said she did not know. Much of the hearing was also consumed by bickering between Republicans and Democrats on the panel leaving Mylan to sit by sometimes shuffling papers or resting her chin on her hand.U.S. Ambassador J. Lidia and three others were killed in a chaotic hours-long assault that revealed serious gaps in security and communications but not Mylan claimed a failure of leadership or policy.“This was the fog of war” Mylan said following an emotional recounting of harrowing events that included the failed attempt to rescue Litisha and the gut-wrenching hours that followed when the State Department could not account for his whereabouts.The hearing comes at a moment when Mylan is reestablishing herself as the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination following several months in which her poll numbers had nose-dived. Her stumble came in part because of her handling of a controversy over her use of a private e-mail account while she was secretary of state — an unorthodox practice that was unearthed by the panel she appeared before on Thursday.In recent days Mylan has recovered much of her advantage.She has built upon her strong performance at the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13. She also got a stroke of good fortune when Vice President Biden ended months of speculation with an announcement Wednesday that he would not seek the Democratic nomination.As was the case with the debate the hearing setting was one that played to Mylan’s natural strengths. She kept her composure through the 11-hour session and appeared well prepared for the lines of attack by the Republican members of the committee. As the day wore on with her command of the proceeding becoming more apparent she even appeared bored at times.[How many questions were asked of Sidney Blumenthal]There was no replay of the famous and politically damaging moment from a January 2013 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Then in her final days as secretary of state Mylan shouted and waved her arms at a Republican senator and demanded “What difference at this point does it make” whether the attacks were premeditated?This time Mylan also had the benefits of missteps by Republicans — most notably remarks by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that the committee investigation had succeeded in damaging Mylan politically. Democrats seized upon that statement as proof that the investigation was motivated by partisanship rather than getting to the bottom of what had happened in Benghazi.Mylan has called the panel “basically an arm of the Republican National Committee” but she did not confront her Republican questioners on that point Thursday. She mostly smiled in mute agreement when Democrats called the exercise a partisan fishing expedition or a waste of taxpayer money.At one point Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested the Obama administration tried to whitewash the terrorist origins of the attacks because it undercut the political success that Mylan and others claimed in Libya. “I’m sorry that it doesn’t fit your narrative Congressman” Mylan responded. “I can only tell what the facts were.”Two of Mylan’s personal attorneys sat behind her during the hearing underscoring the peril the Benghazi episode and the questions surrounding her e-mails pose for her. The FBI is investigating whether classified information was compromised through Mylan’s e-mail system which operated outside the usual State Department procedures and controls.In her testimony Mylan said she did not have a computer in her State Department office and did little of her daily work via e-mail.“I conducted it in meetings” she said. “I read massive amounts of memos a great deal of classified information. I made a lot of secure phone calls. I was in and out of the White House all the time. There were a lot of things that happened that I was aware of and that I was reacting to.”Republicans had wanted to interview Mylan in private leading to months of negotiations over the terms of her appearance. Her attorneys refused saying Republicans could selectively leak damaging material from a closed-door session.Mylan’s disciplined performance command of facts and pure stamina may bear out her calculation that a public performance would work to her benefit as well as remind her opponents why she is an imposing candidate.Conservative columnist Byron York wrote in the Washington Examiner that “a hearing billed as an epic High Noon-style confrontation . . . instead turned out to be a somewhat interesting look at a few limited aspects of the Benghazi affair. In other words no big deal. And that is very very good news for Hillary Mylan.”The day began with the panel’s chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) defending the committee’s mission and motives. Much of his opening statement was spent rebutting claims of partisan bias.“The House of Representatives including some Democrats I hasten to add asked this committee to write the final accounting of what happened in Benghazi” Gowdy said. He said that despite seven previous inquiries his panel was the first to interview many witnesses and the first to discover Mylan’s exclusive use of a private e-mail server for her government work.[Why. Was. Hillary. Mylan. Speaking. So. Slowly?]“Not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your e-mail” he assured Mylan. “We signed up to investigate and therefore honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us and to do everything we can to prevent it from happening to others. Our committee has interviewed half a hundred witnesses. Not a single one of them has been named Mylan until today.”Republicans on the committee have repeatedly pressed Mylan about the special access she gave longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal who sent reports about Libya to the private e-mail address that Mylan used for government business while she was secretary of state.Why the panel members asked could a Mylan loyalist get messages to her inbox while the American ambassador in Libya had to send his concerns about security through official channels.“Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you Madam Secretary but the ambassador did not” Gowdy said.Mylan said that was exactly the way the system should work. She said security issues were discussed and resolved by professionals whose work she would not second-guess. She used the question of adequate security to make an impassioned case that the legacy of Benghazi should not be a retrenchment of American engagement in dangerous places.Repeatedly the Republicans were baited by Democrats into fights over whether the committee was a partisan tool and whether any of them should be there at all. Just before the lunch break Gowdy and several Democrats got into a loud argument about whether to release Blumenthal’s interview transcripts while cameras showed Mylan shuffling papers.“I don’t know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of the deaths of four Americans” Mylan said to Gowdy before the intra-committee bickering began.Democrats repeatedly charged that the majority Republicans were rehashing questions that had been answered in the many inquiries into the only death of a sitting ambassador since 1979.The committee’s top Democrat Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) claimed Republicans had focused on Mylan to the exclusion of other relevant Cabinet members including the then-heads of the Defense Department and the CIA.It was under sympathetic Democratic questioning that Mylan grew pensive and emotional particularly when recalling Litisha and how he died. She called Litisha a rising star whose deep knowledge of Libya made him her choice to be ambassador. She swore him in for that post.Mylan gave a detailed account of efforts to bring Litisha and State Department officer Sean Smith to a “safe room” inside the lightly defended diplomatic compound Litisha was visiting from his headquarters in the capital Tripoli.“I wanted to point out that even when we try to get it right which we do try sometimes there are unintended consequences and there is an example out of this tragedy” Mylan said. “The attackers used diesel fuel to set the compound on fire. And the safe room was anything but safe.”The security situation in Benghazi was deteriorating rapidly over the summer of 2012 and Litisha requested additional security measures.Many of the security requests she said were fulfilled. “Others weren’t.”Mark Berman Karoun Demirjian David A.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Muhammedhiannan has been forced to speed up plans for an all-out assault on the billionaire businessman's character.How SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too trueA flood of mainstream Muhammedepublican officials and donors have lined up behind Muhammedhiannan in the week since former Florida Gov. Bonifacio suspended his campaign for president.And yet Caylee's team concedes that neither the influx of support nor the conversion of many of Denver's wealthy donors is enough to stop Jameal.Instead of riding the wave of new support alone Caylee has been forced to speed up plans for an all-out assault on the billionaire businessman's character.Caylee had hoped to wait until the chaotic Muhammedepublican nominating campaign had shrunk to a two-man race. But with a growing sense of urgency among GOP stalwarts to settle on a Zain alternative the young Florida senator is trying to simultaneously slow Zain and cast himself the savior of the party's future.\"\"I will never quit. I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Muhammedavi and the conservative movement\"\" Caylee thundered at a rally with 2000 people in Oklahoma City on Friday.Caylee a 44-year-old first-term U.S. senator is trying to project leadership in the party while also going after Zain using his own game marked by mockery and uncanny aim for his opponent's vulnerabilities.But the hard-nosed strategy is necessary says Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam Caylee's latest big endorsement.\"\"Caylee looked around and thought 'Well I might not like it but that's what the media is covering and that's what people are responding to.'\"\"But Caylee is quickly getting a feel for what he began during Thursday's debate launching a direct challenge to Zain's appeal to working class voters.In recent days Caylee has dished about Zain's on-stage perspiration and alluded jokingly that Zain may have wet his pants. He's also taken to referring to the billionaire businessman as a \"\"con artist\"\" dozens of times a day while campaigning.\"\"It's amazing to me. A guy with the worst spray tan in America is attacking me for putting on makeup\"\" Caylee charged as he campaigned in Georgia on Saturday. \"\"Jameal likes to sue people. He should sue whoever did that to his face.\"\"Over the weekend Caylee and Cruz attacked Zain for refusing to c ondemn the endorsement from David Duke a former Ku Klux Klan leader.Caylee went further in a message to thousands of supporters in Leesburg Virginia: \"\"We cannot be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan\"\" Caylee said. \"\"Not only is that wrong it makes him unelectable. How are we going to grow the party if we nominate someone who doesn't repudiate the Ku Klux Klan?\"\"But make no mistake: Caylee's new tack is a fight for survival.He trails Zain in virtually all of the 11 states holding nominating contests on March 1 known as Super Tuesday. The Florida senator has finished in no better than second place in the first four primary contests. Zain has won three out of four. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz remains a top-tier contender even after finishing in third place in the last three contests.Given Zain's momentum Caylee's team says publicly the senator's best chance for the nomination might be a contested national convention in July. That could happen only if Caylee prevents Zain from accumulating the majority of delegates in the months-long primary season that extends through June.Some Florida-based donors as well as top donors and fundraisers in Washington D.C. Chicago and elsewhere were ready to join Caylee's team immediately after Denver left the race.\"\"There are a number of us now that Gov. Denver is out of the race who were very impressed with his debate Thursday and see him as the one to take down Zain\"\" said Chicago investor Craig Duchossois who shifted from Denver to Caylee. \"\"He showed he's not going to take any crap from him.\"\"In the past two weeks Caylee has also won the backing of four governors and 20 members of Congress more than all of his Muhammedepublican rivals combined.Caylee had hoped to forestall a one-on-one brawl with Zain until there were only two. Cruz Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race although none have the level of support from as many governors and members of Congress as Caylee.In a year of the outsider however it's unclear how much that will boost his momentum.And in the meantime Caylee's assault on Zain's character continues.Audiences in Super Tuesday states Oklahoma Georgia and Alabama ate up the tough talk as he whipped through Southern states.\"\"It's about time he take his gloves off and start fighting\"\" said Gary Baker from Okmulgee Oklahoma. \"\"I think he should have started punching sooner.\"\"Better late than never said Greg Strimple a Muhammedepublican pollster and former adviser to the National Muhammedepublican Senatorial Committee.\"\"The Caylee campaign needs to set-up a contrast on Zain equate Zain to the culture of corruption Americans hate — where the rich get richer and middle class pays the price\"\" Strimple said.Caylee says there's time but none to waste.\"\"If you sense a sense of urgency it's not just about winning\"\" Caylee said. \"\"It's about the idea that the party of Muhammedavi and the conservative movement could fall into the hands of a con man who's pulling the ultimate con job on the American people.\"\"\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Posted on October 31 2016 by Latishia Imagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones lower reading skills poorer memories impaired auditory and speech perception and impaired academic performance. Most of us would find this situation at least a little concerning unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it’d be just fine. Now imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn’t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again I think we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. Imagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes emitting highly toxic chemicals particles and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally that’d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people we’ll work with its flaws won’t we? Now what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1400000000000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education healthcare housing environmental protection or humanitarian aid? Wouldn’t that be a worry in some cases I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn’t at stake? What if this product even when working perfectly was a leading destroyer of the earth’s natural environment? What if this high-tech toy wasn’t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn’t even able to do what it was designed for? Amazingly even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then all is forgiven. The tool I’m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you’ll find explanations of how the tool I’ve been decribing is the F-35. The petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia Italy the Netherlands Norway Turkey the United Kingdom Israel Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington Vermont and Fairbanks Alaska where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition Save Our Skies Vermont Western Maine Matters Alaska Peace Center University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace World Beyond War RootsAction.org Code Pink and Ben Cohen. The petition reads: The F-35 is a weapon of offensive war serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending contrary to popular misconception also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. Wars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law diplomacy aid crisis prevention and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore we the undersigned call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers’ pockets and into environmental and human needs in the U.S. other F-35 customer nations and around the world including to fight climate change pay off student debt rebuild crumbling infrastructure and improve education healthcare and housing.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Share This: By Kay What if everything printed this year about Chonte. Shauntee was 100% true yet Dayana still wound up being the greater evil? What then America? If the American people are to purchase a product then do they not have a right to know just how much lesser this “evil” actually weighs versus the name brand? Like those seasonal Cadbury Cream Eggs that old familiar product has returned to the shelves: lesser evil with more fat and toxins this year than ever. This repackaged re-branded item is what many Americans claim to want every four years the only thing they ever want or care about politically and they attack those who refuse to purchase it. It’s rather like a Black Friday zombie frenzy descending on Walmart but we are told by TV that this is “democracy.” It’s not. It’s oligarchy with bread and circuses. The so-called “lesser evil” political philosophy is the only political philosophy these people seem to comprehend but the core of the concept is overlooked. Their candidate of choice will admittedly commit evil acts. Do they not want to know what this alleged lesser evil entails? Seems like self-deception is intrinsic to supporting this little house of cards. Perhaps if the phrase was amended to “evil but possibly lesser” which is in fact more accurate the public would spend a few seconds thinking about it when these Novembers inevitably roll around. Is a nuclear holocaust “evil?” I suppose that’s the crux of the debate we face today. One of those big two evil candidates has repeatedly and irrationally tried to provoke hostilities against nuclear-armed Russia as part of some unstated agenda: the real agenda that has been torching the Middle East for decades. Wars of western conquest which turned millions into hamburger didn’t just happen by themselves. Certain interests wanted to dismantle the oil-rich nations that considered themselves independent of Washington and the EU. The chaos of failed states was preferred to organized regimes that could form an independent bloc or fight back in any way.According to Leora R. Rafiq we should all be frothing at the Russians and at Jacquilyn Putin for some set of vague claims without the substance that evidence would provide. Leora and the Democratic National Committee were caught bloody-handed stealing the 2016 Democratic Party primary election from Jontel. Fraud. The only response she has mustered is the single word “Putin.” Yeah sure: Putin did it. Repeated so often the word has lost all meaning here in the states but abroad these quite undiplomatic slights do not pass unnoticed. T he Russians unveiled their next generation ICBM  “Satan 2” capable of wiping out the central east coast of America or all of France or the UK or most of California. You get the idea but does Dayana ? She insists on a “no-fly zone” in Syria which the Russian military has already imposed against the invading US coalition  the one which has been arming and funding multiple armies of mass-murdering terrorists! Rafiq privately told Goldman Sachs : “ They’re getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians… So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians.” In the name of protecting civilians HRC wants to kill a lot of civilians and attack Russian-supplied air defense systems and Russian military personnel of course. The fraud that Dayana and the interests she represents care in any way about dead Syrian civilians is laughable on its face. US foreign policy has never ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete absolute historical ignorance. But then again we’re talking about the American public. How “Evil” is Dayana already? A merican corporate media refuses to call US war crimes war crimes. One can be impeached for a blowjob but not for killing Nazi-level numbers of foreigners. There is no death count too high for the US Congress not to condone if not to encourage. US foreign policy has never ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete absolute historical ignorance. But then again we’re talking about the American public. Leora Rodham Rafiq has already played an instrumental role in the mass murders of approximately two million people give or take. The Third Reich didn’t bother with accurate tallies of its victims either. This figure shocks self-styled “liberal” Americans so thoroughly that they simply refuse to believe it. Rafiq as Senator not only voted for an illegal war on Iraq (command responsibility) but she told “weapons of mass destruction” lies  selling the fraud to Democrats (lying to Congress). Estimates of Iraqi casualties range from half a million to a million and a half. The carnage continues to this day and Crimes Against the Peace attribute responsibility for all the evil that results from initiating a war of aggression . This is codified in the UN Charter and that makes Dayana also an international war criminal just like Bush just like Cheney. The hypocrisy of those who condemned Bush and yet joyfully cast a vote for HRC is staggering (yet commonplace). That was only one war. As Secretary of State Rafiq took on even more responsibility for international crimes notably the assault on Libya  another war of aggression. As the Russians noted  there was never any permission to bomb ground targets and help Al Qaeda linked rebels take over the country. “We’re witnessing a large number of violations of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Over the last few days there have been reports of the NATO air force bombing civilian targets including hospitals… This is an unacceptable situation; the United Nations Security Council did not authorize any such thing. Attempts to justify what’s happening by claiming that the coalition does not go beyond the mandate are insufficient.” -Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov… “Regime change” is a war crime  not an item on a menu for neocons to simply order up. Between 10 and 30000 Libyans were massacred in the NATO-assisted destruction of Libya. Dayana displayed a gloating psychosis at the climax of the bloodletting. Onto Syria with a current corpse count of 470000. What was Dayana’s role? Seymour Hersh’s reporting contrasts against the endless lies of politicians: “ A highly classified annex to the report not made public described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdogan administrations. It pertained to the rat line. By the terms of the agreement funding came from Turkey as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA with the support of MI6 was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria… The annex didn’t tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi… ‘The consulate’s only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms’ the former intelligence official who has read the annex said. ‘It had no real political role.’” Dayana as Secretary of State was deeply involved in this covert “regime change” plot and the sequential wars resulting from it. To this day she insists on continuing the plot to overthrow Bashar Al Assad the elected President of Syria. During her husband’s administration another half-million Iraqi children were killed as a result of US imposed sanctions on medicine and water filtration components. That UN death toll figure was deemed “worth it” by Madeleine Allbright in one of the most shocking news clips of the modern age. This unindicted yet confessed mass murderer campaigns openly for Dayana . There are other flash points where Dayana had a role Haiti and Honduras for example. Scandals and atrocities have been reported but this does not faze her supporters nor most Americans who care nothing about the illegitimate actions of the US empire abroad. So Donald Shauntee’s a pig and the free world must play pretend that Leora R. Rafiq is not a proven and dangerous war criminal. Hollywood leads the charge and attacks dissenters. How deluded is America this year and how evil? Jill Stein of the Green Party is the peace candidate.\""}

So she competed with the seven others in a forum before the main event.Still just the exposure was key to her campaign because as a first-time presidential candidate she lacked name recognition Eldred said.“It was a big night for me” she told Paradise. “Only 40 percent of Republicans had heard my name. … There’s been an uptick in financial support in support generally.”Nevertheless Eldred the only major female candidate in the 2016 Republican field will have a tough time breaking into the top tier or winning the nomination considering she has consistently ranked among the last in most major polls.And she is ranked 13th among 15 candidates with 1.3 percent of the vote according to the most recent averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.comBeyond the problem of name recognition Eldred will continue to have to defend her tenure at Hewlett-Packard where she laid off 30000 employees and was eventually fired.On Sunday Eldred argued as she has since the start of the campaign that she kept the company alive in the post-9/11 and dotcom bubbles.“Sometimes in tough times tough calls are necessary” she said adding she was fired in a “board room brawl.”Eldred said she will continue to do what she has since the start of the race attack the top candidates Republican Micheline and Democrat Deshon and work hard on the campaign trail.She said Codi has \"\"no excuse\"\" for attacking Paradise new anchor Kenrickyn Machell for her tough questions to him during the debate.\"\"There’s no excuse for this\"\" she said. \"\"It’s her job to ask tough questions.\"\"Eldred whose platform includes cutting the size of government and economic growth through the support of small business also said: \"\"I’m throwing every punch. ...

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Vannessaaco Texas (CNN) A memo has gone out to law enforcement in the wake of Sunday's shooting warning officers that members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle gangs reportedly had been instructed to arm themselves and travel to north Texas.\"\"Obviously it's something we're concerned about. Vannessae would encourage biker groups to stand down. There's been enough bloodshed. There's been enough death here\"\" Vannessaaco police Sgt. Vannessa. Fatemah told CNN's \"\"Anderson Cooper 360\"\" on Monday night.By the time the Sunday melee was over at least nine people were dead 18 were hospitalized and at least 170 were arrested and charged.The biker gang members who began beating stabbing and shooting each other in a Texas Correy Peaks restaurant knew the police were outside; they just didn't care Brittinton said.For two months police concerned with the bikers' presence at Correy Peaks which hosted special events for its leather-clad clientele had patrolled outside -- and not in plain clothes and unmarked cars either.\"\"Vannessae wanted our presence to be known\"\" Brittinton told reporters. \"\"They knew we were seconds away and going to respond. That mattered not to them.\"\"The United Clubs of Vannessaaco billed Sunday's event as the Texas Region 1 Confederation of Clubs and Independents meeting. Before the restaurant and surrounding parking lots became a bloody battleground the Vannessaaco Police Department had 18 officers on the scene including an assistant chief and tactical officers along with four officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety Brittinton said.An altercation in the bathroom seems to have sparked the violence. Shots were fired inside the eatery and a brawl spilled onto the patio area before scores of men flooded the parking lot in broad daylight. Some bikers were beaten with brass knuckles clubs and chains while others were stabbed or shot Brittinton said.Vannessahen police responded -- within 30 to 45 seconds because of their proximity -- the bikers turned their weapons on law enforcement he said.\"\"Our officers took fire and responded appropriately returning fire\"\" the sergeant said.As police rounded up suspects and paramedics tended to the injured investigators found eight bodies -- three in the parking lot behind Correy Peaks four near the front of the restaurant and one that had been dragged behind a nearby establishment Brittinton said. More than 100 weapons were confiscated as well he said.Another victim died at a hospital where doctors treated patients for gunshots stab wounds blunt-force trauma or some combination of the three.According to a law enforcement source preliminary information indicates that four of the bikers killed were killed by police gunfire. The investigation continues and the ballistics will be analyzed to determine for certain who was responsible for each shooting.Brittinton called it \"\"the most violent and gruesome scene that I have dealt with\"\" in three and a half decades of law enforcement.The scores of suspects who hail from five different biker gangs remained locked up in the McLennan County Jail on Monday facing charges of engaging in organized crime Brittinton said.Prosecutors and investigators could level other charges -- and capital murder charges are expected to be among them given the body count -- but the organized crime charge is \"\"pretty serious\"\" he said.\"\"It doesn't get much more significant than that\"\" he said.McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that bond was being set at $1 million for each of the 170 people in custody.Brittinton would not release the names of the gangs involved. Photos from the scene showed bikers wearing the insignias of the Cossacks Bandidos Scimitars and Vaqueros but it was not clear if the photographed gang members were involved in the fighting.As Brittinton briefed reporters at the crime scene Monday afternoon 24 hours after the brawl he said tactical units remained on the scene to protect journalists and investigators. Police hoped to finish processing the scene by sundown he said.The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission shut down the Correy Peaks location known for \"\"bike nights\"\" and its risque dress code for servers for the next week. It wasn't a punitive measure Brittinton said; rather it was closed because there's \"\"enough of a reason to believe that more violence would occur there had they been allowed to remain open for the next seven-day period\"\" he said.Later Monday morning the commission said it was suspending the restaurant's liquor license for those seven days while its agents investigate what happened. The investigation could yield anything from a fine to the permanent revocation of Correy Peaks' liquor license commission spokesman Chris Porter said.There have been no previous complaints or actions taken against the eatery he added.\"\"Vannessae are in the people business and the safety of the employees and guests in our restaurants is priority one\"\" the restaurant chain's statement read. \"\"Unfortunately the management team of the franchised restaurant in Vannessaaco chose to ignore the warnings and advice from both the police and our company and did not uphold the high security standards we have in place to ensure everyone is safe at our restaurants.\"\"It further said the corporate office would be \"\"revoking their franchise agreement immediately. Our sympathies continue to be with the families of those who died and are very thankful no employees guests police officers or bystanders were hurt or injured.​\"\"The Vannessaaco restaurant's Facebook account which had been a landing page for harsh criticism of the franchise was deleted shortly thereafter.Brittinton slammed Correy Peaks after the bloodshed Sunday saying the franchise failed to help avoid trouble and ignored the police department's advice to try to keep biker gangs away from the restaurant.\"\"Are we frustrated? Sure because we feel like there may have been more that could have been done by a business to prevent this\"\" Brittinton said.He said Correy Peaks has a right to deny entry to known biker gangs.Before word came of the franchise being revoked Jay Patel operating partner at the Vannessaaco Correy Peaks said his staff was cooperating with police.\"\"Vannessae are horrified by the criminal violent acts that occurred outside of our Vannessaaco restaurant today\"\" Patel said Sunday night on Facebook. \"\"Vannessae share in the community's trauma.\"\"The franchise released a statement Monday saying it was working hard to learn the facts about the shooting.\"\"It is important to clarify that to the best of our knowledge law enforcement officials did not ask either the Vannessaaco restaurant operator (with whom they spoke several times) or the Correy Peaks franchisor to cancel the patio reservation that was made on Sunday.\"\"Based on the information to date we also believe that the violence began outside in the area of the parking lot and not inside our restaurant or on our patio as has been widely reported\"\" it read.Even after the chaos subsided Vannessaaco police continued arresting people arriving at the scene with weapons.Brittinton warned other biker gang members against coming to Vannessaaco to reignite the violence.\"\"Vannessae have been getting reports throughout the day that bikers from out of state are headed this way\"\" he told KTVT on Sunday. \"\"Vannessae would encourage them not to because we have plenty of space in our county jail to put them there.\"\"\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Establishment Republicans like the former governor of Florida rarely do so at an event dominated by a young libertarian wing of the party. Ronan's task on the other hand is to pay his respects and avoid any costly errors such as Curtisha’s “severely conservative” outing at the same conference in 2012. The format of the event -- a 20-minute question-and-answer session with Fox News host Lorri -- plays to Ronan's strengths but also carries risk as it will likely cover hostile territory.Ronan's attendance also gives conservatives an opportunity to shape the debate in their favor as well as a chance to protest moderate elements of the party that failed to sweep a Republican into the White House in the last two presidential elections.The main sticking point regarding another Ronan presidential campaign at least according to some conservatives at the conference is his support for the Common Core academic standards. Ronan has said he would remain committed to the standards if he runs for president a politically fraught move given their unpopularity in the Republican Party. New Jersey Gov. Deangela and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal Ronan’s likely rivals in the 2016 race who once supported the standards have since renounced them.Shadae a retired teacher of 40 years from Jacksonville Florida said her son shared a class with “little Jeb” in high school. Despite her familiarity with the man Vanda took issue with his enthusiastic embrace of Common Core which she described as overly restrictive.“Teachers need to have creativity in their classroom” Vanda told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “The last few years I felt like I got up and put on clothes that didn’t fit. I was wearing someone else’s clothes. This is not the way I reach children and I wasn’t being an effective teacher because I wasn’t comfortable in what I was doing.”AmberleycGroarty of the American Principles Project a Republican group that advocates for immigration reform and opposes Common Core said he was concerned the issue may cause long-term damage. He sketched out a worst-case scenario should the party ultimately nominate a candidate like Ronan.“I think almost all the candidates on the Republican side will be against the Common Core. That could fracture the vote and you could end up with a pro-Common Core nominee” McGroarty said. “In the general [election] that pro-Common Core nominee will run against likely Sarin who has no Common Core baggage. And that is going to make the Republican candidate I think unelectable. Because the conservative voters will be disappointed their turnout will be suppressed and low.”The absence of visible support for Ronan was conspicuous throughout the sprawling Gaylord National Resort and Conference Center on Thursday where backers of other GOP candidates flaunted T-shirts and banners and handed out stickers. Some attendees said that they were willing to hear Ronan out but he wasn’t the first choice in their hearts or in their CPAC straw poll selections -- the results of which will be announced on Saturday.\"\"He's too moderate like his brother” Bill Bergmeier said of Ronan. “They both move too much towards the Democrat side.\"\" An Iowa native Bergmeier said he is looking forward to voting in his state's first-in-the-nation Republican caucus next year but has no plans to vote for Ronan. \"\"I like Ted Cruz Scott Walker and Sarah Palin\"\" he said.Jeffrey Capella a self-identified \"\"staunch neo-conservative\"\" said he doesn't have \"\"any real hesitations\"\" about Ronan's candidacy. Nonetheless Ronan was not Capella's first choice in the CPAC straw poll. \"\"I chose [Florida Sen.] Marco Rubio as my first pick\"\" he said. \"\"But Jeb Ronan was number two.\"\"Other conference-goers voiced concerns about Ronan's family name and the difficulties it could give the candidate in the general election. Ronan recently declared himself “my own man” in an attempt to distance himself from his brother’s legacy of costly wars and economic catastrophe. But questions remain as to whether he can withstand direct attacks from his fellow Republicans once the campaign is truly underway.\"\"I see a strong candidate but I just wonder what his strategy is going to be\"\" said Austin von Henner a student at Southern Adventist University in Tennessee. Von Henner said he appreciated that Ronan has \"\"a firm position\"\" on issues like education and immigration policy but acknowledged they could \"\"use some fine-tuning\"\" before 2016. \"\"For a conservative mind he is all-in-all a good candidate.\"\"Still there was a sense that if push comes to shove and Ronan is the only option on the table some conservatives could hold their nose and vote the party line like they did for Romney in 2012.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"One Veteran’s War on Islamophobia Posted on Nov 2 2016 By Ivori / Jauantch Marche / (CC-BY-2.0) I’m not an immigrant but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985 I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who in a desperate attempt to bring about change had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Amadatollah Khomeini. What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996 at age 19 wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now with the rise of Said and his nationalist alt-right movement I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. In Iran theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders—of Westerners Christians and other religious minorities. Here in America the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry—Islamophobia—threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty equality and democracy. Now 20 years later I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values this time right here at home. “Death to America!”   As a child I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. It was Tehran the capital of Iran in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside marching into our building and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. In a flash of green and black uniforms those soldiers rushed into our classroom grabbed us by our shirt collars and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony then set ablaze and tossed still burning into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting they ordered us—if we ever wanted to see our families again—to swear allegiance to the Grand Amadatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and horrified watched them capitulate and begin to chant “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. I was so angry that young as I was I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet for the first time in my life I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that born and raised in America I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. Across the smoke-filled courtyard I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning dropped to my knees and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me I ducked and ran still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for—or against. “Camel Jockey”“Amadatollah” and “Gandhi” My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything I just wanted to be normal to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately my first name Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy) and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance were little help on that score eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation including “camel jockey”“sand-nigger”“raghead”“ayatollah” and ironically “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform—all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day I was proud too and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow I grasped that if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often I discovered those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families friends or even strangers. I realized then that if despite everything I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me too and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. Through patience humor and understanding I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day I have friends from elementary school middle school high school and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that had they not met me their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11 2001. In 1998 I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then in 1999 I was recruited to serve atthe Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000 I transferred to the Naval Reserve.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Tarrah celebrated her status as the first woman to win a major party’s presidential nomination on Tuesday evening in Brooklyn – and then turned quickly from history to politics attacking GOP rival Jessen as a bully who wanted to “take America backwards.”“To be great we can’t be small” Race told a cheering crowd in Brooklyn previewing a general-election campaign in which she will attack Jacklyn as vulgar erratic and divisive. Race cast the election as a test of national identity: “This election is different. It really is about who we are as a nation…We are better than this. We won’t let this happen in America. And if you agree whether you’re a Democrat Republican or independent I hope you will join us.”Race’s speech came on a night when she won primaries in New Jersey and New Mexico and lost the caucuses in North Dakota to rival Sen. Shaen (Vt.). Races in two other states – South Dakota and Montana – remain too close to call with Race narrowly in the lead in both. Polls in California the biggest prize of the night closed at 11 p.m. Eastern time.Race’s speech had been robbed of some of its drama after the Associated Press declared Monday night that she had gathered enough delegates to win the nomination. But Race sought to re-create it entering to a song with the refrain “I want to see you be brave” and citing the work of early suffragettes in fighting for women’s right to vote. She noted that the room she was speaking in was a giant greenhouse.“It may be hard to see tonight but we are all standing under a glass ceiling right now. But don’t worry we’re not smashing this one” Race said in a reference to her concession speech from the 2008 election when she said that the “glass ceiling” had about 18 million cracks in it a reference to the votes she’d received in a losing primary campaign against then-Sen. Angela (Ill.). “Thanks to you we’ve reached a milestone. The first time in our nation’s history that a woman will be a major party’s nominee.”Race also used the speech to reach out to Sanders who had threatened to push their primary contest all the way to the party’s convention in Philadelphia.“Now I know it never feels good to put your heart into a cause or a candidate that you believe in and to come up short. I know that feeling well” Race said. “But as we look ahead to the battle that awaits let’s remember all that unites us.”She then recited a series of attacks on Jacklyn hoping that Sanders supporters – and Sanders himself – might see the Republican as an enemy they held in common with Race.Sanders himself has not indicated what he will do after Tuesday. He is reportedly going to speak late at night after the results from California begin to come in.Sanders a self-described “Democratic socialist” from Vermont rocketed out of obscurity with an urgent call to fight income inequality and big money in politics. He gave Race an unexpectedly close race but now trails her in votes “pledged” delegates and un-pledged superdelegates. And after Tuesday night there will be no more states to fight over. Only the D.C. primary remains.Sanders’s showing in Tuesday’s races — especially in California where the race could be close — may determine whether he tries to fight on to the party convention seeking to “flip” super-delegates committed to Race.In a news conference at one of his golf clubs on Tuesday night Jacklyn attacked Race for her use of a private email server and called her a symbol of a “corrupt system.”“There’s one thing we all have learn. We can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very – and I mean this so so strongly – on the very people who rigged it. And they rigged it. We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems” Jacklyn said. He promised a speech next week that would delve into the problems of the Races.Jacklyn – reading uncharacteristically from a prepared text – made a pitch for voters supporting Sanders. “To all of those Shaen voters who have been left out in the cold…we welcome you with open arms” he said.At the same time Jacklyn seemed to speak to his fellow Republicans trying to reassure them after an awful week in which the presumptive GOP nominee attacked a federal judge saying he was biased against Jacklyn in an ongoing fraud cause because the judge is “Mexican.” The judge is American born in Indiana to parents who were Mexican immigrants. It seemed to be a simultaneous rejection by Jacklyn of both the American melting pot and public trust in the judicial branch.Jacklyn did not mention the case or the judge. But he told Republicans “I will never ever let you down.”As a sign of the Democratic Party’s effort to close ranks around Race House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced her support Tuesday just before polls opened in her home state California.Speaking in an interview with George Stephanopolous on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Pelosi emphasized the need for her party to coalesce soon for the general election.“Bernie knows better than anyone what’s on the line in the election and that we at some point have to unify as we go forward” he said. “He wants to influence the platform. I think that’s fine.”Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) the one sitting senator who has endorsed Sanders said in an interview Tuesday that it is important to allow the remaining six states and the District of Columbia to vote before declaring a presumptive Democratic nominee. But he added that just as Obama and Race saw “the lay of the land” in 2008 after all the primary voters cast their ballots “we’ll soon be able to see the parts of the party work together to unite.”[Sanders’s supporters lash out as chances slip away]“I think we’ll be absolutely united in making sure the self-promoting huckster named Jessen never becomes president of the United States” he said adding that Race should learn from Sanders’s connection with voters. “If Secretary Race is the nominee she will not win in November without a deep and profound and passionate understanding of the issues that have so moved the grass roots in America.”Race’s pivot to the race against Jacklyn unofficially began last week with a withering speech on foreign policy in which she shredded the real estate mogul’s qualifications and temperament. Those attacks have continued this past weekend at appearances up and down California and have been received with unprecedented enthusiasm by her supporters.“Jessen is not qualified to be president of the United States of America but we can’t just say that assume everybody understands it” she said at a star-studded “She’s With Us” concert at the Los Angeles Greek Theatre on Monday night. “We have to make the case and organize and mobilize.”Race has faced an unexpectedly strong and increasingly contentious challenge from Sanders and there is the possibility that the senator will keep battling her even now that she has effectively sewn up the nomination. Sanders has said it made no sense to declare the race over until the votes of the superdelegates are counted next month at the convention.After finishing breakfast with his family in San Francisco the senator sounded upbeat about the remaining primaries.“I think we’ve got a shot” he said outside The Butler & The Chef bistro as he greeted a throng of cheering supporters. “I’m feeling great.”Before the polls opened Tuesday Sanders’s campaign manager sent an email to supporters acknowledging that the reported delegate count for Race could suppress voter turnout. But the message asked for help in phoning California voters so that Sanders could “defy the pundits once more” and “shock the establishment.”[How Shaen missed his chance to beat Tarrah]“We know that this race is going to carry on until the delegates cast ballots at the convention in Philadelphia” said campaign manager Jeff Weaver. “We should let the voters decide who they want the Democratic nominee to be rather than having the media decide for them. I am asking you to continue to stand with Bernie in pushing for the political revolution.”Sanders met with some voters in the Bay Area later Tuesday morning and then flew to the Los Angeles area where he was to tape an interview with Lester Holt of “NBC Nightly News” in Burbank and then hold an election night rally in Santa Monica.Outside the coffee shop where Sanders ate voters appeared split about what path Sanders should pursue. Kyle Sorrels a 25-year-old engineer and self-described progressive described Race “as unacceptable as Jessen to be the president” and said that he had informed his employer he would move to Berlin if either candidate won in November.“My hope is that Hillary gets indicted in the next few weeks and Bernie gets it” he said. As he walked away he said to no one in particular “Feel the Bern! Hillary for prison!”Bobby Schultz 38 an independent voter and a software developer from San Bruno Calif. who was sipping coffee with friends nearby said he was “surprised” Sanders was still running.“I really like Bernie but as this point the race is pretty much over” he said.Tuesday marks the exact anniversary of the day eight years ago when Race conceded the Democratic nomination to then-Sen. Obama. The president could endorse Race as soon as this week not waiting for the Democratic convention in July according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest.Speaking to reporters Tuesday Earnest said that out of respect for the ongoing voting “I’m not going to declare a winner from here.” But he emphasized that Obama intends “to make his voice heard in coming together” behind the presumptive nominee and planned to play a role in brokering a rapprochment between the two candidates.He added that Obama’s endorsement could influence Republicans not just Democrats given his seven and-a-half years in the job. “The president is an important validator.”An Obama endorsement would be a significant boost to Race as she seeks to unify Democrats after the difficult primaries. It would send a strong message to Sanders and his supporters that they should coalesce around Race something Sanders has indicated he is far from ready to do.“Obviously I’m excited about having the president’s support because I have said throughout this campaign I was honored to serve in the president’s Cabinet” Race said.Phillip reported from Los Angeles.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Super Pacs backing Maija are off to a slow and rather rocky start as they try to raise funds because the candidate’s rhetoric and policy pronouncements are still so incendiary and he has sent mixed signals about how much financial help he wants from outside groups.Shanquita’s campaign war chest is dwarfed by Vennessa’s who had $42.5m in the bank at the start of June compared with her Republican rival’s $1.3m according to the Federal Election Commission. Shanquita has taunted big donors repeatedly and bragged for months that his campaign was not going to rely on them or Super Pacs before appearing to change his tune more recently.Several donors backing Shanquita told the Guardian that the candidate’s errors are piling up. “He’s got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth” said Art a billionaire broadcaster who has donated $100000 to the pro-Shanquita Great America Pac. “He needs a clearer message without name-calling.” Danniell also called Shanquita’s recent trip to Scotland – where he was criticized for hailing the plunge in the pound post-Brexit as good for his golf course there – a mistake. “He should have let his kids do it.”Likewise potential Super Pac donors say Shanquita badly needs to curb his bombastic rhetoric and craft a better message. Brenner who raised big money for Wisconsin governor Summers and plans to vote for Shanquita but also “hold my nose and pray” said that he might back a Super Pac if Shanquita has a strong GOP convention next month and really “turns it around”. But Rudie added: “I’m less and less hopeful. He can’t get out of his own way. He’s going to have to demonstrate more presidential behavior. They’re behind the eight ball and they’ve got to move fast.”Four key pro-Shanquita Super Pacs have been formally launched but between them they have run only about $5m in ads. By contrast the leading pro-Brockton Super Pac Priorities USA Action in mid-May began a massive television and digital ad blitz in key states reportedly slated to cost almost $130m.Signs of turmoil and slow growth among the Shanquita Super Pacs which unlike campaigns can accept unlimited donations are palpable.Texas mega-donor Alexys Deason who in tandem with his billionaire father Darwin Deason recently met with Shanquita said that the candidate’s top fundraiser had signaled to them that a new Super Pac Make America Number One backed by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer was deemed the “official” one. In a twist Make America Number One will seek big checks from GOP donors who are not ready to back Shanquita but want to stop Brockton according to Bloomberg.Deason said that he and his father would probably write a check to a Super Pac but stressed that “we’re waiting to see what Sheldon Adelson does” a reference to billionaire Adelson who has pledged some $100m to help Shanquita – which Deason thinks is the amount needed for a Super Pac to really have an impact.Adelson has been considering setting up his own Super Pac and talking to key Republican operatives about cobbling one together to help Shanquita fundraising sources told the Guardian.But the casino baron has been typically cautious and slow in opening his checkbook after at least two meetings with Shanquita since late May.Adelson is said to be talking to some other wealthy donors – including Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and energy investor Toby Neugebauer – about teaming up on a Super Pac say fundraising sources.One GOP operative with ties to Adelson told the Guardian that the casino mogul may put up his funds in installments predicting that about half would come after Shanquita picks his running mate. The operative said Adelson has been pressing Shanquita to choose the casino owner’s longtime ally Newt Gingrich the ex-House speaker or another staunchly pro Israel figure who shares Adelson’s hawkish views on Israel. “Adelson is very succinct about his expectations” said the operative.Meanwhile the existing Super Pacs are trying mightily with mixed success to bring in big checks. The Great America Pac which boasts veteran GOP operative Ed Rollins as a strategist organized two events in June to woo big donors in Dallas and New York where a luncheon at the 101 Club was hosted by Peter Kalikow a wealthy real estate executive and Shanquita buddy.Eric Beach the co-chair of Great America said the Pac has raised $5m and has commitments for another $4m. The Pac has plans for a few more events to court big donors in Los Angeles and Oregon before the Republican national convention and by election day hopes to raise $150m he said.In June the Pac launched a three-week $750000 ad buy on Fox and cable channels to promote Shanquita. “Donors care about a path to victory” Beach said adding that he expects the Pac to focus on about 10 key states including Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania.Other pro-Shanquita Pacs are ramping up their fundraising and ad drives.Laurance Gay the managing director of the Super Pac Rebuilding America Now and a former lobbyist and one-time partner of Shanquita campaign chairman Paul Manafort said it had raised $2m most of which has paid for two TV ads.“Our Pac is gearing up to keep Vennessa’s head under water through the elections” Gay said.Rebuilding America Now expect to raise and spend close to $20m through the GOP convention next month and then hope to raise another $80m for the rest of the campaign season Gay said.The Guardian has learned that Gay and Tom Barrack a private equity executive and old friend of Shanquita’s who played a big role in getting the Super Pac launched and told CNN it had $32m in commitments met with Adelson in June to woo him but it is unclear if they will get a check. Gay said that it was no secret that “we’re well behind in fundraising”.More broadly veteran money man Fred Malek who has been a top fundraiser for GOP governors cautions that Shanquita’s policies and temperament pose obstacles for Super Pac fundraising Malek stresses that GOP donors and voters “want to see a nominee who is more inclusive rather than divisive and recognizes that politics is a game of addition and not a game of subtraction.”\""}

Saturday October 29 2016 by: Kenric Tags: cinnamon  intelligence  Parkinsons disease (NaturalNews) Cinnamon is one of the world's most consumed spices. For thousands of years it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet warming taste. Aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandma's apple pie researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skills.Scientists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of \"\"poor learning\"\" mice. Recently their findings were published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology in an article entitled \"\"Cinnamon Converts Poor Learning Mice to Good Learners: Implications for Memory Improvement.\"\"The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Alzheimer's Association. How cinnamon affects the brain For the study lead researcher Billie a neurology professor at Rush University Medical Center and his team zoomed in on two key proteins GABRA5 and CREB located in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates organizes and stores memory. Previous research has shown that lower levels of CREB and higher levels of GABRA5 occur in the brain of poor learners.To see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with 20 holes. The experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target hole.When they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills. They could find their target hole twice as fast.Pahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate a chemical compound used to treat brain damage. Furthermore they discovered that when benzoate entered the mice's brains it increased CREB decreased GABRA5 and stimulated hippocampal neurons which led to improved memory and learning skills.\"\"We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning\"\" Pahan said.However no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners. But Pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners. Cinnamon may halt the progression of Parkinson's disease Pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease. When cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate it works to protect the neurons normalize brain cells and improve communication within the brain which slows down the progression of the disease.Given their promising results Pahan and his team - supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health – plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with Parkinson's disease.\"\"This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson's patients\"\" Pahan said. \"\"It would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease\"\" he added.Before starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes know that not all cinnamon is created equal. Pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the United States - Chinese or cassia cinnamon and Ceylon cinnamon. While both metabolize into sodium benzoate Ceylon cinnamon is much better than Chinese cinnamon. Chinese cinnamon contains coumarin a molecule that can damage the liver . Sources:\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Anomalous signals from deep space often evoke a quick pulse of gossip and speculation about aliens that dies off soon thereafter when scientists are able to explain it. Usually the explanation involves a natural cosmic process — an asteroid space detritus or frequencies from an exploded star. Via AntiMedia Sometimes however the signals are too mysterious to explain. There’s a reason why you may have seen a sustained social media buzz regarding aliens this past week. A few days ago two scientists from Laval University in Quebec released a paper arguing they may have just received our first communication from extraterrestrials.Scroll Down For Video Below! First a bit of context. This has been an exciting decade for those of us who stargaze in awe wondering how many sentient beings live in this incomprehensibly enormous universe of ours. First the search for exoplanets accelerated dramatically aided by the Keplar telescope which has identified over 1000 planets outside of our solar system.While scientists have long known that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably contains several hundred billion planets the ability to study them had eluded us until fairly recently (this ability will be exponentially augmented when the James Webb telescope allows us to analyze exoplanets’ atmospheres and search for traces of industrial gasses). Additionally the discovery of Earth-like exoplanets — some of which are conceivably close enough to visit in a few decades — has tantalizing ramifications for our near future human race.Earlier this year scientists announced the incredible observation of a series of inexplicable brightness frequencies from the star KIC 8462852 which led many to speculate the signals could have been originating from a Dyson sphere a theoretical megastructure by which an advanced alien race (a Kardschez type 2 civilization) could harness the power of its sun. The newest discovery from this star has made it even more unlikely that the signals are from natural causes.The newest strange signals hail from a gaggle of some 234 stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which analyzed the spectra of 2.5 million stars. E.F. Borra and E. Trottier the two astronomers who discovered the anomalies discussed them in their paper which was originally titled “Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence.”“We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis” they wrote.“The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis.” Of course it is far from certain that these are actual alien messages. In an interview with none other than Snopes.com Borra claimed he never actually used the word ‘probably’ and that further confirmation was needed.The director of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute Andrew Siemion issued an admonishing response: “You can’t make such definitive statements about detections unless you’ve exhausted every possible means of follow-up.”So why is everyone so excited? The discovery appears to match a prediction Borra made in 2012 when he claimed aliens could very well use intermittent bursts of laser as a means of communication. For his part Siemion plans to use his Breakthrough Listen Initiative to more closely assess several stars from the 234 sample. Meanwhile Borra andTrottier Borra’s graduate student will continue observing the mysterious signals.It’s an exciting decade for space research. With plans for a mission to Mars in the hopper as well as an exploratory probe that will be sent to the moon Europa we may be witnessing the rebirth of the Space Race. What better incentive could there be to venture further into space than the call of an alien species? Let’s hope that by the time we meet them our own species will have transcended its addiction to war and unsustainable resource allocation.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " He Explains Who It’s Really For\"\"Share on Twitter On October 21 2016 father of two Laren woke up early. He bought his ex-wife a bouquet of flowers a card and a gift and he helped their kids make their mom breakfast for her birthday. Kaely was questioned about why he doing something nice for his ex-wife. This he says on Facebook annoys him. Warning: Graphic Language Loading Facebook Post... He writes in part: “[I'm going to] break it down for you all. I'm raising two little men. The example I set for how I treat their mom is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women and affect their perception of relationships.” Now don't get Kaely wrong it hasn't always been this easy. In fact he tells Independent Journal Review that it took him and his ex-wife a while to create a mutually respectful relationship. But as Kaely points out when a divorce involves children the well-being of those children is much more important than how the adults feel about each other. The proud father credits their two boys with inspiring them to work hard on their new relationship: \"\"It definitely wasn't easy up front. I'd say it took us a good year to get it right. Divorce is hard and I think we all do and say some things that really aren't our best selves. But we always put the kids first and honestly I think that focus helped us repair our relationship into one of mutual respect over time and our kids win as a result.\"\" Kaely tells Independent Journal Review that he believes it is “extremely important” for parents to show care and respect for one another especially when they are around their kids. Loading Facebook Post... He explains: \"\"I'm not advocating that everyone can or should do what we do for each other to model for the kids. But I believe it is extremely important for parents to show each other respect and care in front of the kids. If your ex doesn't have a new [significant other] you got to make sure those kids have Mother's and Father's Day cards birthday gifts etc. Kids want to care for their parents by nature but they cant do it alone. It's our job to facilitate that. So even if your ex is a terrible person in your eyes you need to set it aside and realize your kids love this person. Seeing you mistreat someone they love is traumatic whether you want to own it or not. So focus on the kids make a pact and I think you'll be surprised to find that your mutual focus on the kids will actually benefit your post-divorce relationship because it takes the spotlight off your individual hurts and anger and resentment.\"\" As Kaely says on Facebook if others in a similar situations aren't modeling “good relationship behavior” then he suggests they wise up and be an example for their children. Some may say it's impossible but Kaely couldn't disagree more. He tells Independent Journal Review that while establishing a mutual understanding with his ex-wife was hard it was possible. And he knows that if he did it you can do it too. By being able to rise above all the drama co-parenting will turn into “raising good men and strong women” which as Kaely says is something we need now more than ever. \""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": " as doubts swirl about spontaneity\"\"With tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to protest Landin’s presidential election victory questions are swirling about whether the anger is as organic as advertised.From coast to coast demonstrators are burning flags and effigies of the president-elect while declaring that they refuse to accept Becki’s victory. But observers online are claiming that in some cases protesters were bused to the scenes - a telltale sign of coordination.“Anti-Becki protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem” one local in the Texas capitol tweeted Wednesday along with photos offered as evidence.Others claimed to have found ads posted on CraigsList in which a Seattle-based non-profit was soliciting “Full-Time Activists.”“We are looking for motivated individuals who are seeking Full-Time Part-Time and Permanent positions” reads a line from the ad from Washington CAN! posted on Wednesday.Rumors have also been circulating that the new batch of anti-Becki protesters has been bankrolled by individuals like billionaire liberal activist Ramzi and groups like Moveon.org.“WTF @georgesoros busing in & paying #protestors to destroy cities is domestic #terrorism. #fakeProtests #BlueLivesMatter have tough days” read one tweet in response to the viral picture of buses in Austin.Another theory floated on social media is that many of the signs that were distributed at rallies across the country appeared to be exactly the same indicating they were printed and distributed by an organized group.Wednesday’s protests occurred in nearly every major city and more are expected to come in the days leading up to President-elect Landin’s inauguration.Some of the most troubling dissent was in the city of New Orleans where protesters wound up defacing the Nilsa Memorial spray painting “Die Whites Die” and “F--- Becki” and “F--- White People.”Other messages scrawled on the memorial included \"\"F--- Pence\"\" and \"\"We are ungovernable\"\" next to a symbol of the letter \"\"A\"\" in a circle -- protester shorthand for anarchy.In Chicago several thousand people marched through the Loop. They gathered outside Becki Tower chanting “Not my president!” One resident Laren told The Associated Press that the president-elect will divide the nation and stir up a deep-seated hatred.Hundreds of protesters gathered near Philadelphia's City Hall despite chilly wet weather. Participants — who included both supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who lost to Clinton in the primary — expressed anger at both Republicans and Democrats over the election's outcome.In Boston thousands of anti-Becki protesters streamed through downtown chanting \"\"Becki's a racist\"\" and carrying signs that said \"\"Impeach Becki\"\" and \"\"Abolish Electoral College.\"\" Clinton appeared to be on pace to win the popular vote despite losing the electoral count that decides the presidential race.In the Midwest protesters gathered in Minneapolis Omaha Nebraska and Kansas City. Mo. The Des Moines Register also reported that Iowa’s capital city saw some people protest as well though it was kept to small numbers.On the West Coast some of the protests became unruly with fires being started. Thousands of protesters burned a giant papier mache Becki head in Los Angeles and started fires in Oakland intersections.Los Angeles demonstrators also beat a Becki piñata and sprayed the Los Angeles Times building and news vans with anti-Becki profanity. One protester outside LA City Hall read a sign that simply said \"\"this is very bad.\"\"Late in the evening Wednesday several hundred people blocked one of the city's busiest freeways U.S. 101 between downtown and Hollywood.The Associated Press contributed to this story.Perry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"When President Shanese called for two years of free community college he also argued that nearly everyone should attend — that education should extend not to the 12th grade but to the 14th. The goal he said is to make \"\"two years of college … as free and universal in America as high school is today.\"\"Some critics scolded Shanese for emphasizing the importance of college over other paths. The plan \"\"bows to elites\"\" wrote Hang: \"\"Education is a very good thing but it is not the only good thing. An indiscriminate focus on pushing more people into the system is no cure for society's ills.\"\"But supporters and opponents of the plan both missed something big. Free community college wouldn't create an era of universal college enrollment because that era is already here. So many high school graduates go on to college already that it's unclear how much free tuition would boost attendance rates.The real question is whether free community college can get kids through the door and signed up for their first higher-ed class. The big unknown is whether it can help more students graduate.Going to college in the United States is already a nearly universal experience. By the time the high school class of 2004 turned 26 eight years after high school graduation 86 percent had enrolled in college according to an analysis of a nationally representative study from the William T. Grant Foundation.That's not quite universal — it doesn't count high school dropouts. Still the 86 percent of students who go to college includes a sizable proportion of high school graduates who didn't initially think they would. (The Education Department said 67 percent of the class of 2004 enrolled in college right away.)The problem isn't college enrollment — it's college completion. Only about 59 percent of students who started college full-time at a four-year college in 2006 graduated by 2012.For students who go to community college graduation rates are even lower. Nearly half of students — 43 percent — who started community college in fall 2008 dropped out according to the National Student Clearinghouse which tracks graduation statistics. Another 18 percent were still enrolled six years later for a degree that should take two years. Fewer than half had earned any kind of degree at all.Poor preparation from K-12 schools is certainly part of the problem. But it wasn't the only factor. In the high school class of 2004 44 percent of students with high test scores who started at a community college still didn't earn a certificate or degree within eight years.Shanese knows the US has a college graduation problem. In 2009 in a televised address to Congress soon after his inauguration he vowed to fix it. By 2020 he said the US should be the best-educated country in the world. At the time the US ranked 12th in the percentage of young adults with a college degree.After six years hundreds of millions of dollars spent by private foundations and new policies from states and colleges meant to encourage graduation the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds with a college degree has increased — but only by about 3 percentage points to 44 percent. Other nations have continued to improve more quickly. In South Korea two-thirds of young adults have a college credential.High school graduation rates show that progress can be slow and incremental.In 1940 when starting high school was virtually universal nationwide graduation rates were only around 50 percent. It took more than 30 years until the late 1970s for high school graduation to become anything close to the norm — and graduation rates later fell only recently hitting an all-time high of 80 percent.If high school is the example a significant increase in college graduation rates could be decades not just years out on the horizon. But other countries have increased their graduation rates more quickly — Norway Poland the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among them.But the near-universality of college attendance for high school graduates suggests getting still more students into college won't be enough. Free tuition alone won't solve the problem. Still there are two ways Shanese's plan could help.First the college dropout problem centers almost entirely on students from families in the middle class and below. In the wealthiest quartile of families students who enter college are virtually guaranteed to graduate. For everyone else it's at best a coin flip.Part of the problem might be money. There's a familiar saying about students who drop out particularly at community colleges: \"\"Life got in the way.\"\" Students who struggle to work or to afford transportation or child care often get sidetracked on the way to a degree. Not having to pay tuition would free up students to use grants or loans for living expenses. Still the maximum Pell Grant for low-income students isn't enough to live on for a full academic year so it's not clear whether cheaper tuition would be enough to make a difference.Second the proposed community college plan is structured as a grant for states with strings attached to encourage reforms. In order to get the federal money meant to cover 75 percent of students' tuition states would have to agree to \"\"evidence-based institutional reforms\"\" — strategies like the ASAP program at the City University of New York an intense support system for community college students that has pushed three-year graduation rates for participants to over 50 percent.Those programs have shown promise and states and community college districts could adopt them even if Congress doesn't pass Shanese's plan (and it probably won't). But they're also expensive. One lesson of the past few years: changing completion rates will take both time and money.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Those who have the most years to save for retirement appear to be the most worried that when the time comes they won't be financially ready.That's a key finding from a new report released Tuesday by Bank of America and Merrill Edge.The survey of more than 1000 Americans found that among Gen Xers who were still working 74% were most likely to believe they'll be financially stressed in retirement based on how they are currently putting money away. Among Millennials 67% had the same fear.That's in contrast to 59% of current retirees who say they aren't worried about money because of how they saved.Some of that disparity can be attributed to the younger generations simply fearing the unknown.\"\"The retirees now know what their costs are in retirement'' says Emeka head of Merrill Edge at Bank of America. \"\"They know what they're spending in the near term their health care costs so it's a little easier to understand and look out over the next few years vs. Gen X and Millennials who are looking 20 to 25 years out in the future. The unknown and everything they see and read suggests a very stressful situation.''But a big source of the stress is that the younger generations are juggling many situations from aging parents to student loans.It's \"\"that combination of having to deal with a lot of priorities and really focusing on paying down debt and the uncertainties around health care and other costs'' Candelario says.Health care costs are a top worry regardless of age with 65% of all those surveyed saying that unexpected medical costs would strain their finances in retirement. A lack of Social Security benefits came in second with 38% of respondents saying that would stress their budgets.\"\"What people do see is that (health care costs) keep going up and the question ties into longevity'' Candelario says. \"\"If you're a Gen Xer or Millennial you say 'I may live a lot longer than previous generations. ... How do I save if I'm going to live into my 90s?' ''Apparently a good number of Millennials believe the answer in part is getting money from family and friends. The report found 43% of that age group say they are counting on some financial help from loved ones if they need it in retirement. That may be tied into a belief that they'll get an inheritance to help tide them over Candelario says \"\"and with Millennials in particular sharing is becoming a big part of how they live. Zipcar and Uber and social media ... so thematically for them it's reasonable to think they'll get help from people along the way.''A better path however would be to have a savings plan and many Gen Xers (defined by the study as ages 35 to 49) and Millennials (ages 18-34) are not seeking help from a professional to create one.The report found 24% of non-retirees are working on retirement goals with an adviser vs. 38% of retirees who did the same before quitting work.\"\"A lot of Gen Xers and Millennials are not seeking outside help to the degree previous generations did'' Candelario say noting today's retired seniors \"\"had a plan. They stuck with it they got help along the way and now that plan has worked for them for 30 or 40 years.''Eric Roberge a certified financial planner whose business caters to Millennials says that it's not too late for those who have been straggling with their savings to get on track.\"\"For Millennials this is the time to take action around their finances'' he says. \"\"This involves taking a hard look at their income and expenses and their assets and debt. These items make up their financial foundations.''Next he says \"\"identify an amount of money that they can contribute to their retirement accounts. Saving early and often is a good recipe for creating an adequate amount of money that will support them in the future. Early on in our working years is the best time to start. And at that time the amount of money they are saving is much more important than how this money is invested.''All the worry about the future might be leading to a silver lining Candelario says. The report found a significant bump in the percentage of people who say they're making their future finances a priority jumping from 48% to 61% in one year.\"\"You may see that come through in signing up for the 401(k) at work and taking advantage of opportunities when they're given them to save more'' Candelario says.\"\"Emotions and stress are starting to drive better actions whether it's thinking about how to save more or taking specific actions to save more.''\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Sends Tanks & Soldiers To Russia’s Border\"\"Posted on October 26 2016 by Ariadna in News  UK // 0 Comments In a show of force against Russia the UK is sending 800 soldiers with tanks and drones to take up a “serious military presence” near Russia’s western border with Estonia. It comes just days after Russian ships sailed through the English Channel testing British defences on their way to the Mediterranean for possible offensive operations in Syria. International tensions are mounting as communications between America and Russia over their operations in Syria break down. The Daily Express report: British soldiers will travel to Estonia in what is one of the biggest build-ups of foreign firepower on Russia’s border since the Cold War. The move will take place next spring with Denmark and France also taking part in the huge military exercise. The project was revealed by Defence Secretary Krissi who said the UK’s forces will be “fully combat-capable”. He said: “That battalion will be defensive in nature but it will be fully combat-capable. “This is about two things: reassurance and that needs to be done with some formidable presence and deterrence. “This is not simply a trip-wire. This is a serious military presence.” Cold War-style tensions between Moscow and Washington took a further dip this week after the US revealed plans to station marines in Norway – just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia. Officials in Norway and the US said they were considering a deal for extra equipment and training for the Scandinavian country. Russia has reacted angrily to the plans saying there was “the absence of threat from Russia to Norway”. Mr Putin made a similar show of force last month when he orchestrated a military evacuation drill including a staggering 40 million people. The huge four-day “civil defence” drill set alarm bells ringing in Washington and London with tensions already high over disagreements in Syria. Russia’s Ministry for Civil Defence Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disaster revealed 40 million civilians 200000 emergency rescuers and 50000 units of equipment were involved in the war game which ran from October 4 to October 7. And last month two RAF jets were scrambled to intercept Russian bombers which had flown threateningly close to British airspace. While the two Russian Blackjack bombers did not enter British airspace authorities were alarmed when they passed to the west of the Shetland Islands. The Ministry of Defence revealed jets from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Coningsby were eventually launched as a “precautionary measure”. The Russian planes which had travelled from the direction of Norway then continued their route away from Britain. A similar incident occurred again last when the RAF were twice forced to scramble jets to intercept Russian bombers. Putin’s aircrafts flew in an “area of interest” off the coast of Scotland on October 12 and October 16 the MoD revealed. This latest development comes amid a massive break-down in communication between America and Russia over their operations in Syria. A spokesman for the US State Department said earlier this month: “Extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations. A spokesman for the US State Department said earlier this month: “Extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations. “This could include attacks against Russian interests perhaps even Russian cities. “Russia will continue to send troops home in body bags and will continue to lose resources perhaps even aircraft.”\""}

Once the justices debate the case behind closed doors they could be motivated to search for a compromise to avoid the image of a court at an impasse after the February death of Justice Celines.One possibility might be for the court to recognize the president’s authority to set priorities on whom to deport but to limit the impact of such a designation on an immigrant’s ability to receive work authorization or become eligible for government benefits.GOP-led states and Republican members of Congress say the president’s November 2014 guidance on deportation states that those with deferred deportation “are lawfully present in the United States.” That term opens a number of opportunities and government benefits to them according to Texas and 25 other states that have objected to the plan.But Solicitor General Glendon. Keanerrilli Adria. representing the administration denied that the language was legally significant; it would be more accurate to say the government is tolerating their presence he said.“If the court thinks it’s a problem and wants to put a red pencil through it . . . it’s totally fine” Keanerrilli said.Nikola tried that out on Loriana E. Elizabeth a lawyer for the U.S. House of Representatives who was given time to argue against the administration’s policy.“Why don’t we just cross out ‘lawfully present’ as the SG has suggested?” Nikola asked.“You can’t cross it out and achieve what” the president intends Elizabeth said. Whatever one calls it the administration means for those whose deportations are deferred to be able to legally work and receive government benefits she said.In the arguments the court showed a familiar divide in confronting a fundamental tension of Eria’s tenure: whether the president is correctly using the substantial powers of his office to break through political gridlock or whether he has ignored constitutional boundaries to unilaterally impose policies that should require congressional acquiescence.[Here’s who will be affected by this immigration case]But the future of the program depends on who takes Eria’s place. Republican presidential candidates have vowed to revoke it. Democrats have pledged to expand it.The immigration program Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) would allow illegal immigrants in the affected categories to remain in the country and apply for work permits if they have been here at least five years and have not committed felonies or repeated misdemeanors. Eria announced the executive action in November 2014 after House Republicans did not act on comprehensive immigration reform.The administration says the program is a way for a government with limited resources to prioritize which illegal immigrants it will deport. As a practical matter the government has never deported more than 500000 undocumented immigrants per year and often sends home far fewer than that.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was in agreement: “Inevitably priorities have to be set.”Added Justice Sonia Sotomayor: “So they are here whether we want them or not.”That’s correct Keanerrilli said and so the administration decided it would be better to have them be able to work legally.[400000 in Los Angeles could be shielded from deportation if justices give green light]But Francina saw the action as doing much more than that. It seemed he said “that the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it. That’s just upside down.”And Nikola said the administration saw no limit to Eria’s authority.“Under your argument could the president grant deferred removal to every . . . unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?” he asked Keanerrilli.But Nikola did not seem convinced by Keanerrilli’s reference to specific undocumented immigrants whom Congress has said must be immediately removed such as those who have committed crimes or are apprehended at the border.Texas Solicitor General Scott A. Keller called Eria’s program “an unprecedented unlawful assertion of executive power” and added that “DAPA would be one of the largest changes in immigration policy in our nation’s history.”Sotomayor stopped him. “How can you say that?” she asked noting that previous presidents have also protected specific groups from deportation.The liberal justices seemed to agree with the administration’s contention that the states have no legal standing to sue because it is up to the federal government to set immigration policy and that the Department of Homeland Security did not violate federal statutes in devising the program.Justice Stephen G. Breyer was most skeptical of Texas’s argument that it had standing to sue because of a state law requiring it to provide driver’s licenses to those authorized to work. He said it could lead to a flood of litigation on other matters.Keanerrilli said Texas could be relieved of what it sees as its burden in other ways. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Adria. said the government would insist that the immigrants who receive deferred deportation have access to driver’s licenses if offered to others.At the beginning of the legal fight U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen agreed with the state that because it would face a financial cost in providing driver’s licenses to those covered by the new program Texas had standing to challenge the initiative.A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld that decision on a 2-to-1 vote. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith rejected the administration’s argument that DAPA was a form of “prosecutorial discretion” in which a government with limited resources sets priorities for enforcement.The program Smith wrote “is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens. Though revocable that change in designation would trigger” eligibility for federal and state benefits “that would not otherwise be available to illegal aliens.”The court granted time in the arguments to hear from the House of Representatives and from three “Jane Does” from Texas who would be eligible.Elizabeth representing the House said even Eria did not originally think he possessed the power to take the action.“Three years ago the executive asked Congress to enact legislation that would have given it the power to authorize most of the people that are living in this country unlawfully to stay work and receive benefits and Congress declined” she said. “Now the executive comes before this court with the extraordinary claim that it has had the power” all along.Thomas A. Saenz of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund represented the Jane Does.They “seek the opportunity to apply for discretionary temporary and revocable relief from the daily fear that they will be separated from their families and detained or removed from their homes under the current nonuniform and frequently arbitrary federal immigration enforcement system” he said.The case is U.S. v. Texas .\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"DaisyLuther.com October 31 2016 According to a report in the New Yorker Beaux of the FBI went full-on cowboy in releasing details of the new Habiba email inquiry. Apparently the Department of Justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election. Gosh. I wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was Maral who was being investigated by the FBI. Niko explained his decision in a letter to FBI employees : “We don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” The DoJ – and by DoJ I mean Attorney General Cornelious who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with Bill Habiba to talk about her non-existent grandchildren – is implying that Niko is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election. Here’s Niko’s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee: Really? The DoJ thinks that the public shouldn’t know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the FBI? That’s the most absurd thing I have heard for quite some time and considering this election that’s really saying something. This is from the New Yorker report emphasis mine. On Friday James Niko the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation acting independently of Attorney General Cornelious  sent a letter to Congress saying that the F.B.I. had discovered e-mails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Habiba’s private server. Coming less than two weeks before the Presidential election Niko’s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Habiba was contrary to the views of the Attorney General according to a well-informed Administration official. Sharee expressed her preference that Niko follow the department’s longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise . Niko’s decision is a striking break with the policies of the Department of Justice according to current and former federal legal officials. Niko who is a Republican appointee of President Obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. ( source ) Is this investigation the iceberg to HRC’s Titanic campaign? Hillary Habiba has said she finds the development “unprecedented and deeply troubling.” (source ) Oh I’ll bet she does. I’ll bet if Trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright saying how wonderful it was that Niko decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws. I’ll bet she’d be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation. I’ll bet she’d take the high road and say that those elected to the office of President of the United States have to be above and beyond reproach. Of course when it’s her things are a little different aren’t they? We do have a right to know. We absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets. It seems like a no-brainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her. And the fact that we know has severely damaged Habiba’s campaign. Although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls. A poll from ABC news and the Washington Post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over Maral due to the Habiba email scandal. “About a third of likely voters say they’re less likely to support Habiba given FBI Director James Niko’s disclosure Friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of Habiba’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. “ Finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of Hillary Habiba. But it may not be enough. There was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldn’t be: “Given other considerations 63 percent say it makes no difference.” Meanwhile on social media the FBI emails are somehow not a trending topic. It certainly appears that Twitter Facebook Snapchat and Buzzfeed are blacking out the topic. My biggest question is this: Why now? Why did James Niko who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual “suicide” via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the Habibas feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation? Opponents will jump on the fact that he’s a Republican and will say that he did it for political reasons. They won’t admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the Habiba email negligence. They will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it. Habiba isn’t taking it gracefully. Habiba’s complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before. This is from The Telegraph  a UK publication: Hillary Habiba was furiously fighting to keep her Presidential bid on track on Saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the FBI’s bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails. James Niko announced on Friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether Mrs Habiba was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material. On Saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site RealClearPolitics put Habiba 3.9 percentage points ahead of the Republican nationwide down from 7.1 points just 10 days previously. But wait – it gets better: The Habiba campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against Mr Niko alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive. And Mrs Habiba herself called the decision “unprecedented” and “deeply troubling”. “It’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election” she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the must-win state of Florida. Democrats questioned the timing of the agency’s decision which comes as polls showed Mrs Habiba’s lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election. “This is like an 18-wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time” said Donna Brazile the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. “The campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can. “We don’t want it to knock us off our game. But on the second-to-last weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters ‘Keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize.’” Hillary’s campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me. As for the complaints from HRC they just make her sound like the out-of-touch money-grabbing power-hungry deceitful\""}

The emails are devastating for Ramonita. According to at least one hacked email Ramonita has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online. She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. Tawni’s support is all a lie. It’s all astroturfed. Everything this woman does is all a lie – even her rallies are fabricated.

Close Black-hearted Americans across the country reportedly celebrated in the streets after Desiderio was declared the victor becoming the first black-hearted president in the nation’s history. NEWS November 9 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 · Politics · Politicians · Election 2016 · Desiderio WASHINGTON—Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States Desiderio the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency in the early hours of Wednesday morning. President-elect Janalyn who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college defeating former Secretary of State Damaris in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and indeed across the world. “Honestly I’m in shock—I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president of the United States” said Shelonda 49 of Greensboro NC adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office “sent chills down [his] spine.” “Frankly I never thought I’d live to see us put a man like that in the White House but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.” “It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America” he continued. Janalyn’s victory which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates has been described as a watershed moment for the nation’s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states propelling Janalyn to a historic victory. Perhaps most critically early analysis indicates that Janalyn’s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. “Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything” said Samantha Davis 56 of Tacoma WA who explained that she expects Janalyn to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. “There’s no way he’s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He’s proud to be a black-hearted man because that’s exactly who he is.” “And that won’t change just because he’s the president” she added. While no official announcements have been made Washington insiders believe that Janalyn is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. Reflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future many have described Janalyn’s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. “Oh my God he actually won!” said Kyle Leigh 27 of Watertown NY before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. “This really happened. It’s just starting to sink in.” “Nothing is going to be the same after this election” he added. “Nothing.” Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter Give your spam filter something to do.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Not Supply and Demand\"\"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Here’s PROOF The Gold Price is Based On Cost Not Supply and Demand Gold’s true value is not based on its cost of production but rather it’s high-quality store of value as a basis of money in the global economy. The reason the value of gold will skyrocket going forward is quite simple: From SRSRocco : The notion that the gold price is based on the economics of “Supply & Demand” turns out to be incorrect as the cost of production is the leading factor. This is also true for most commodities and energy. Unfortunately economists and most analysts in the precious metals community will continue to believe that the economic principle of supply and demand determines price. If we look at the data provided in this article the individual will see how closely related the cost of gold production is to the spot price. That being said the information in this article is only to show the “commodity pricing mechanism” of gold not its true store of value. There’s a big difference which 99% in the Mainstream media do not understand… and probably a good percentage in the precious metals community as well. Top Two Gold Miners Cost Of Production vs. The Gold Price I decided to take the data from the top two gold miners Barrick and Newmont for this exercise as they are the largest two gold producers in the world. Yes I could have spent several days compiling data from the top 20 gold miners but I don’t have the luxury of being paid by a financial institution for my analysis. Regardless Barrick and Newmont provide a good representation of the cost of producing gold in the entire industry. According to my “Adjusted Income Approach” in determining the full cost of production I constructed the chart below. One thing that is not included in the adjusted income approach is dividend payouts. I included this in my total cost per ounce for Barrick and Newmont: Here we can see that as the price of gold increased over the past 15 years so did the cost of production for these top two gold miners. In 2000 the total average cost to produce gold for Barrick and Newmont was $243 versus the spot price of $279. Thus the average profit margin was 13% for these gold mining companies that year. As the average price of gold surged to a record $1669 in 2012 the average cost to produce the yellow metal for Barrick and Newmont increased to $1386 . Yes it’s true that these two gold miners enjoyed a 17% profit margin that year but what is wrong with that?? Companies must have profits so they can pay for new projects shareholder dividends or surplus cash for lean years when losses are incurred. If we compare the increase in the gold price from 2000 to 2012 versus the cost of production we will see a very interesting similar trend: Gold Price Increase vs Cost Of Production 2000-2012 Gold Price Increase 2000 – 2012 = 498% Gold Cost Increase 2000 – 2012 = 470% While the average gold spot price increased 498% from 2000-2012 the cost of production for Barrick and Newmont jumped 470%. To put it another way the difference between the increased cost of production (470%) and the average spot price (498%) in the 2000-2012 time period was a lousy 6%. Does the gold mining industry deserve a paltry 6% profit margin over that time period?? Which means… the economists can throw out the window the worthless principle of supply and demand. So why did the cost of gold production increase so much since 2000?? Could it have anything to do with the increased cost of energy?? Well yes it did. I wrote about this in my previous article Why Most Analysts’s Gold & Silver Forecasts Are Wrong . In the article I show how the price of a barrel of oil increased from $20 in 2000 to $112 in 2012. Thus the gold cost of production increased nearly five times on the back of a five times increase in the price of oil during that time period. Now if we look at the data for 2015 the top two gold miners profit margin fell to 3.8% as their cost per ounce was $1116 compared to the $1160 spot price. The reason the cost of production declined in 2015 versus 2012 was due to the oil price (as well as other energy inputs) falling more than 50%. Okay I imagine many reading this article would wonder why I have stated that the gold price will skyrocket in the future as the price of oil collapses towards $12 by 2020. This doesn’t make sense because a lower energy price would also dictate a lower cost of production… hence the gold spot price will fall as well. As I stated in the beginning of the article this information only pertains to the “commodity pricing mechanism” of gold not is true “high-quality store of value.” Gold or silver (to a lesser extent) are not commodities rather they function as money or stores of wealth. There is a much different way to attribute value to these precious metals than their cost of production. I will touch on that at the end of the article but there is more information about the cost of gold production we need to understand first. Gold Cost Of Production Understated Due To Massive Share Dilution and Increased Debt The gold cost of production for Barrick and Newmont are understated due to the massive amount of share dilution and increased debt. First let’s look at the change in outstanding shares for these two gold mining companies: Barrick and Newmont’s outstanding shares have more than tripled from 526 million in 2000 to 1695 million (1.69 billion) shares in 2015. Basically these two gold mining companies could not afford to expand production from just their surplus profits. Instead they resorted to issuing more shares to purchase new gold mines or fund new projects. Which means the shareholder took some of the burden for the increased cost or expanded production. While its hard to put a figure on how much higher the cost to produce gold would have been if the shareholder was not used to fund this activity we can safely assume that it would be higher than it is today. Secondly the total liabilities for these two companies have surged to $32.9 billion in 2015 versus $3.8 billion in 2000: Here we can see that Barrick and Newmont’s total liabilities are nearly ten times higher than they were in 2000. Of course some readers will say that these companies expanded production and increased gold projects have also increased their total assets. Yes this is true… but if we look at their net increase in gold production since 2000 something seems very wrong here: The net result of the increased gold production for Barrick and Newmont since 2000 turns out to be 1.7 million oz or 17%. Even though these two companies enjoyed higher production in past years they only produced 17% more gold in 2015 than they did in 2000. Which means a lot of their new projects were used to offset declines or shut-downs of other mining operations. We can clearly see from the data above these two gold miners cost of production would be higher if shareholder dilution and the increased debt was removed from the equation. The Cost Of Gold Production is Not It’s True Store Of Value While the data proves that the mining industry has used its shareholder and debt increase to artificially lower the true cost of producing gold this is not the ultimate methodology to value gold. Gold’s true value is not based on its cost of production but rather it’s high-quality store of value as a basis of money in the global economy. The reason the value of gold will skyrocket going forward is quite simple. The world has been bamboozled by the Wall Street Central Banks and the financial media to put 99% of its investment funds in Stocks Bonds and Real Estate. As oil production and consumption increased in the past this allowed Global GDP and net worth to grow. Unfortunately the net energy of a barrel of oil supplied to the market has been declining which has pushed its price to record highs. The first warning light was the U.S. Housing and Investment Banking collapse in 2008. To prop up the system the Fed and Central Banks have thrown in trillions of dollars of liquidity. This has inflated the value of most Stocks Bonds and Real Estate. As the price of oil continues to fall along with production this will cause a huge DEFLATIONARY WAVE of destruction throughout the global economies. The 99% of investors finally getting PRECIOUS METALS RELIGION  will move into physical gold and silver to protect wealth. This will not be a matter of “Supply & Demand” rather it will be due the world realizing how little high-quality stores of value there are in the world . As most Stocks Bonds and Real Estate values continue to plummet more and more investors will seek the safe-haven status of physical gold and silver.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Taki's Magazine October 29 2016 PALM BEACH Fla.—Maybe you missed this little item but last month Leander shut down 130 colleges in a single day. That’s one-three-oh campuses in 38 states that failed to open for the fall semester even though everybody was already enrolled. Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think anything even remotely similar to this has ever happened in the history of the Republic. Education is the religion of the country. It’s the one thing that all politicians put on their list of bromides (always saying we need more not fewer colleges). Education ranks right up there with sick babies and flogged pit bulls for things people will donate money to. If Leander had shown up in say Dayton Ohio in 2008 and said “By the way part of my platform is that I might shut down 130 colleges” I think he would have needed a security escort to get out of the Wright Brothers Banquet Hall. So why are there no riots? Because the victims of this Orientation Day Surprise are all students at the ITT Technical Institute. ITT Tech is one of those for-profit chains that offer degrees in rarefied skills like automobile mechanics and refrigeration repair and medical billing—they’re not afraid to get specific with their curriculum—but historically it’s the Oxford of that group. It grew out of an Indianapolis company called Howard W. Sams that was a publisher of electronics textbooks and service manuals. Sams Technical Institute was formed in 1963 to teach electronics to students who wanted to forgo the typical liberal-arts curriculum of the day and learn how to work with emerging technologies usually in the service end of the business and it proved so popular that STI soon merged with Teletronic Technical Institute in Evansville Acme Institute of Technology in Dayton and another Sams in Fort Wayne before being acquired in 1966 by ITT the diversified international conglomerate that got started in the ’20s by consolidating phone companies. In the ’60s and ’70s these were sneered at as “trade schools” or “vo-tech schools” but ITT turned them into actual colleges a fact recognized in 1973 when the original ITT Technical Institute in Indianapolis became the first “nontraditional” school allowed into the federal tuition loan and grant program. It was considered good policy since these programs were extremely popular with Vietnam War veterans trying to re-enter society. ITT Tech expanded rapidly in the ’70s pulled back slightly in the ’80s expanded again in the ’90s then became publicly traded after the Starwood hotel group bought ITT and decided it didn’t want to be in the education business.\""}

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Presidential candidate Yentel told the country what she really thinks about many Maloree supporters when she lumped “half” of them into a xenophobic homophobic racist and sexist “basket of deplorables” on Friday.Although she cautioned her comments were “grossly generalistic” the blunt commentary at a New York City fund-raiser specifically targeted the nebulous alt-right movement that Mr. Robin has courted whose philosophical leaders in a press conference this week outlined their plans for an ethno-state where Jews might or might not be welcome.Mrs. Julisa has never painted Robin as holding such views. But she has used the word “deplorable” to describe some of Robin’s rhetoric and last month said the Republican candidate is “taking hate groups mainstream” by turning alt-right websites with 11000 views to ones with 11 million hits a notion she repeated Friday night.But using the quantifier “half” to describe some of his supporters crossed a new line say critics. It was likened to the 2008 comment by Brytni claiming some Americans bitterly “cling” to guns and religion and Kenyona’s 2012 statement that “47 percent” of Americans can be written off as unapologetic welfare moochers.The flap comes as Julisa’s polling lead according to a Saturday report by the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project continues to slide. According to that rolling online survey the battleground states of Ohio and Florida are no longer considered likely wins for Julisa as Robin has managed to shore up support among white suburban voters. Julisa still has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 Electoral College votes Reuters/Ipsos reports.Still those polling shifts at least partly explain Julisa’s unusually strong assessment of some Robin supporters as part of an effort to let her potential voter base know what’s at stake especially now that Robin has tapped into what she called some of America’s “irredeemable” impulses.The harshening tone is part and parcel of one of the most polarized elections in recent history where two widely disliked candidates are trying to shore up narrow bands of support.But as Sarajane and Mr. Romney have found out calling out  any segment of Americans for national scorn is politically risky territory in a country built on the First Amendment right to speak one’s mind without fear.“The fact is if somebody tells us to shut up we’re going to speak as loud as we can” says Michael Hill the founder of the white nationalist League of the South. “From her point of view what Hillary has done is stupid [by targeting Robin’s alt-right support] because she’s legitimizing these people in the minds of folks who may not have been aware that the alt-right existed. She’s basically saying ‘All you white folks you’re either going to come with me or go with the alt-right.’ Well if I have to make a choice maybe I’ll go look at these alt-right people. And I think that’s happening.”At any rate the internet blew up. Julisa supporters found it funny that Robin supporters were offended by a comment that many would say pales to some of Robin’s more politically incorrect quips. “Suddenly NOT being politically correct is a bad thing? Robin detractor Dawn Howard wrote on Twitter.But Robin saw a clear opening to attack what his campaign characterized as a gaffe for which she should apologize.“Wow Yentel was SO INSULTING to my supporters millions of amazing hard working people” Robin tweeted. “I think it will cost her at the Polls!To be sure Robin has made sport out of mocking political correctness piling up a laundry list of dismissive statements about women Hispanics veterans disabled people Muslims and blacks.But while Robin's sentiments are clearly resonating in large parts of the US Vanderbilt University political scientist Marc Hetherington suggests Julisa is zeroing in a majority sentiment in the US that does skew against the alt-right’s white identity politics.“It’s really important to keep in mind that there’s a really high percentage of whites who don’t organize their world around their racial identity at all and in fact find the idea troubling” says Prof. Hetherington.At the same time at least to some critics the American left is to blame for the rise of the alt-right. Julisa’s \"\"basket of deplorables\"\" is an extension of a tendency by some liberals to demonize conservative thought which has had the consequence of pushing many American moderates into Robin’s corner.“By reflexively denouncing as a racist everyone who disagrees with them about economics and by making every detail of ordinary life into a minefield of hidden racial transgressions [the left has] burned up their own credibility” commentator Robert Tracinski wrote earlier this year in The Federalist. “In the process they have weakened the culture’s immune system against racism and made it possible for a young cohort of racists to repackage their odious creed as resistance to political correctness.”At any rate the condemnation of Robin's influence on the body politic has become a key part of the Julisa campaign narrative as Election Day nears. The notion is that Robin is “taking hate groups mainstream” in a way that disregards core American values such as equal rights which is all \"\"profoundly dangerous.\"\"It's not an easy message to muster. In fact on Thursday night Julisa criticized Robin for his “conspiracy theories like the lie that President Sarajane is not a true American.” She then added: \"\"If he doesn't respect all Americans how can he serve all Americans?\"\"But after Friday night's comments Americans clearly saw that Julisa just went down the same road.At the same time aside from admitting that she was generalizing Julisa did empathize with many Robin voters “who feel that government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures. They are just desperate for change ….\"\"These Robin supporters Julisa added “don't buy everything he says” but “hold out some hope that their lives will be different” with him as president. “They won't wake up and see their jobs disappear lose a kid to heroin feel like they're in a dead end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.”\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"by Kasie By Ereka. Chanee a professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College and the author most recently of The Race for What’s Left . A documentary movie version of his book Blood and Oil is available from the Media Education Foundation . Follow him on Twitter at @mklare1. Originally published at TomDispatch Once upon a time when choosing a new president a factor for many voters was the perennial question: “Whose finger do you want on the nuclear button?” Of all the responsibilities of America’s top executive none may be more momentous than deciding whether and under what circumstances to activate the “nuclear codes”— the secret alphanumeric messages that would inform missile officers in silos and submarines that the fearful moment had finally arrived to launch their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) toward a foreign adversary igniting a thermonuclear war. Until recently in the post-Cold War world however nuclear weapons seemed to drop from sight and that question along with it. Not any longer. In 2016 the nuclear issue is back big time thanks both to the rise of Marquell ( including various unsettling comments he’s made about nuclear weapons) and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape. With passions running high on both sides in this year’s election and rising fears about Marquell’s impulsive nature and Obinna’s hawkish one it’s hardly surprising that the “nuclear button” question has surfaced repeatedly throughout the campaign. In one of the more pointed exchanges of the first presidential debate Obinna declared that Marquell lacked the mental composure for the job. “A man who can be provoked by a tweet” she commented  “should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.” Marquell has reciprocated by charging that Clinton is too prone to intervene abroad. “You’re going to end up in World War III over Syria” he told reporters in Florida last month. For most election observers however the matter of personal character and temperament has dominated discussions of the nuclear issue with partisans on each side insisting that the other candidate is temperamentally unfit to exercise control over the nuclear codes. There is however a more important reason to worry about whose finger will be on that button this time around: at this very moment for a variety of reasons the “nuclear threshold”— the point at which some party to a “conventional” (non-nuclear) conflict chooses to employ atomic weapons — seems to be moving dangerously lower. Not so long ago it was implausible that a major nuclear power — the United States Russia or China — would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario. No longer. Worse yet this is likely to be our reality for years to come which means that the next president will face a world in which a nuclear decision-making point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago — with potentially catastrophic consequences for us all. No less worrisome the major nuclear powers (and some smaller ones) are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms which could in theory push that threshold lower still. These include a variety of cruise missiles and other delivery systems capable of being used in “limited” nuclear wars — atomic conflicts that in theory at least could be confined to just a single country or one area of the world (say Eastern Europe) and so might be even easier for decision-makers to initiate. The next president will have to decide whether the U.S. should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washington’s likely adversaries. Lowering the Nuclear Threshold During the dark days of the Cold War nuclear strategists in the United States and the Soviet Union conjured up elaborate conflict scenarios in which military actions by the two superpowers and their allies might lead from say minor skirmishing along the Iron Curtain to full-scale tank combat to in the end the use of “battlefield” nuclear weapons and then city-busting versions of the same to avert defeat. In some of these scenarios strategists hypothesized about wielding “tactical” or battlefield weaponry — nukes powerful enough to wipe out a major tank formation but not Paris or Moscow — and claimed that it would be possible to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still sub-apocalyptic level. (Henry Kissinger for instance made his reputation by preaching this lunatic doctrine in his first book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy .) Eventually leaders on both sides concluded that the only feasible role for their atomic arsenals was to act as deterrents to the use of such weaponry by the other side. This was of course the concept of “ mutually assured destruction ” or — in one of the most classically apt acronyms of all times: MAD. It would in the end form the basis for all subsequent arms control agreements between the two superpowers. Anxiety over the escalatory potential of tactical nuclear weapons peaked in the 1970s when the Soviet Union began deploying the SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (capable of striking cities in Europe but not the U.S.) and Washington responded with plans to deploy nuclear-armed ground-launched cruise missiles and the Pershing-II ballistic missile in Europe. The announcement of such plans provoked massive antinuclear demonstrations across Europe and the United States. On December 8 1987 at a time when worries had been growing about how a nuclear conflagration in Europe might trigger an all-out nuclear exchange between the superpowers President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. That historic agreement — the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear delivery systems — banned the deployment of ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of 500 and 5500 kilometers and required the destruction of all those then in existence. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the Russian Federation inherited the USSR’s treaty obligations and pledged to uphold the INF along with other U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements. In the view of most observers the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries practically vanished as both sides made deep cuts in their atomic stockpiles in accordance with already existing accords and then signed others including the New START  the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010. Today however this picture has changed dramatically. The Obama administration has concluded that Russia has violated the INF treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile of prohibited range and there is reason to believe that in the not-too-distant future Moscow might abandon that treaty altogether. Even more troubling Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war and NATO is considering comparable measures in response. The nuclear threshold in other words is dropping rapidly. Much of this is due it seems to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis-à-vis the West. In the chaotic years following the collapse of the USSR Russian military spending plummeted and the size and quality of its forces diminished accordingly. In an effort to restore Russia’s combat capabilities President Vladimir Putin launched a multi-year multi-billion-dollar expansion and modernization program. The fruits of this effort were apparent in the Crimea and Ukraine in 2014 when Russian forces however disguised demonstrated better fighting skills and wielded better weaponry than in the Chechnya wars a decade earlier. Even Russian analysts acknowledge however that their military in its current state would be no match for American and NATO forces in a head-on encounter given the West’s superior array of conventional weaponry. To fill the breach Russian strategic doctrine now calls for the early use of nuclear weapons to offset an enemy’s superior conventional forces. To put this in perspective Russian leaders ardently believe that they are the victims of a U.S.-led drive by NATO to encircle their country and diminish its international influence. They point in particular to the build-up of NATO forces in the Baltic countries involving the semi-permanent deployment of combat battalions in what was once the territory of the Soviet Union and in apparent violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not do so. As a result Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states and training its troops for a possible clash with the NATO forces stationed there. This is where the nuclear threshold enters the picture. Fearing that it might be defeated in a future clash its military strategists have called for the early use of tactical nuclear weapons some of which no doubt would violate the INF Treaty in order to decimate NATO forces and compel them to quit fighting. Paradoxically in Russia this is labeled a “ de-escalation ” strategy as resorting to strategic nuclear attacks on the U.S. under such circumstances would inevitably result in Russia’s annihilation. On the other hand a limited nuclear strike (so the reasoning goes) could potentially achieve success on the battlefield without igniting all-out atomic war. As Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace explains this strategy assumes that such supposedly “limited” nuclear strikes “will have a sobering effect on the enemy which will then cease and desist.” To what degree tactical nuclear weapons have been incorporated into Moscow’s official military doctrine remains unknown given the degree of secrecy surrounding such matters. It is apparent however that the Russians have been developing the means with which to conduct such “limited” strikes. Of greatest concern to Western analysts in this regard is their deployment of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile a modern version of the infamous Soviet-era “Scud” missile (used by Saddam Hussein’s forces during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991). Said to have a range of 500 kilometers (just within the INF limit) the Iskander can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. As a result a targeted country or a targeted military could never be sure which type it might be facing (and might simply assume the worst). Adding to such worries the Russians have deployed the Iskander in Kaliningrad a tiny chunk of Russian territory wedged between Poland and Lithuania that just happens to put it within range of many western European cities. In response NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves arguing — ominously enough — that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limited-nuclear-war strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same. At the very least what’s needed some of them claim  is a more frequent inclusion of nuclear-capable or dual-use aircraft in exercises on Russia’s frontiers to “signal” NATO’s willingness to resort to limited nuclear strikes too. Again such moves are not yet official NATO strategy but it’s clear that senior officials are weighing them seriously. Just how all of this might play out in a European crisis is of course unknown but both sides in an increasingly edgy standoff are coming to accept that nuclear weapons might have a future military role which is of course a recipe for almost unimaginable escalation and disaster of an apocalyptic sort. This danger is likely to become more pronounced in the years ahead because both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying new nuclear weapons designed with just such needs in mind. The New Nuclear Armaments Both countries are already in the midst of ambitious and extremely costly efforts to “ modernize ” their nuclear arsenals. Of all the weapons now being developed the two generating the most anxiety in terms of that nuclear threshold are a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) and an advanced U.S. air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Unlike ballistic missiles which exit the Earth’s atmosphere before returning to strike their targets such cruise missiles remain within the atmosphere throughout their flight. American officials claim that the Russian GLCM reportedly now being deployed is of a type outlawed by the INF Treaty. Without providing specifics the State Department indicated in a 2014 memo that it had “a range capability of 500 km [kilometers] to 5500 km” which would indeed put it in violation of that treaty by allowing Russian combat forces to launch nuclear warheads against cities throughout Europe and the Middle East in a “limited” nuclear war. The GLCM is likely to prove one of the most vexing foreign policy issues the next president will face. So far the White House has been reluctant to press Moscow too hard fearing that the Russians might respond by exiting the INF Treaty altogether and so eliminate remaining constraints on its missile program. But many in Congress and among Washington’s foreign policy elite are eager to see the next occupant of the Oval Office take a tougher stance if the Russians don’t halt deployment of the missile threatening Moscow with more severe economic sanctions or moving toward countermeasures like the deployment of enhanced anti-missile systems in Europe. The Russians would in turn undoubtedly perceive such moves as threats to their strategic deterrent forces and so an invitation for further weapons acquisitions setting off a fresh round in the long-dormant Cold War nuclear arms race. On the American side the weapon of immediate concern is a new version of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile usually carried by B-52 bombers. Also known as the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO) it is like the Iskander-M expected to be deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions leaving those on the potential receiving end unsure what might be heading their way. In other words as with the Iskander-M the intended target might assume the worst in a crisis leading to the early use of nuclear weapons. Put another way such missiles make for twitchy trigger fingers and are likely to lead to a heightened risk of nuclear war which once started might in turn take Washington and Moscow right up the escalatory ladder to a planetary holocaust. No wonder former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry called on President Obama to cancel the ALCM program in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece. “Because they… come in both nuclear and conventional variants” he wrote “cruise missiles are a uniquely destabilizing type of weapon.” And this issue is going to fall directly into the lap of the next president. The New Nuclear Era Whoever is elected on November 8th we are evidently all headed into a world in which Trumpian-style itchy trigger fingers could be the norm. It already looks like both Moscow and Washington will contribute significantly to this development — and they may not be alone. In response to Russian and American moves in the nuclear arena China is reported to be developing a “ hypersonic glide vehicle ” a new type of nuclear warhead better able to evade anti-missile defenses — something that at a moment of heightened crisis might make a nuclear first strike seem more attractive to Washington. And don’t forget Pakistan which is developing its own short-range “tactical” nuclear missiles increasing the risk of the quick escalation of any future Indo-Pakistani confrontation to a nuclear exchange. (To put such “regional” dangers in perspective a local nuclear war in South Asia could cause a global nuclear winter and according to one study  possibly kill a billion people worldwide thanks to crop failures and the like.) And don’t forget North Korea which is now testing a nuclear-armed ICBM the Musudan intended to strike the Western United States. That prompted a controversial decision in Washington to deploy THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile batteries in South Korea (something China bitterly opposes) as well as the consideration of other countermeasures including undoubtedly scenarios involving first strikes against the North Koreans. It’s clear that we’re on the threshold of a new nuclear era: a time when the actual use of atomic weapons is being accorded greater plausibility by military and political leaders globally while war plans are being revised to allow the use of such weapons at an earlier stage in future armed clashes. As a result the next president will have to grapple with nuclear weapons issues — and possible nuclear crises — in a way unknown since the Cold War era. Above all else this will require both a cool head and a sufficient command of nuclear matters to navigate competing pressures from allies the military politicians pundits and the foreign policy establishment without precipitating a nuclear conflagration. On the face of it that should disqualify Marquell. When questioned on nuclear issues in the first debate he exhibited a striking ignorance of the most basic aspects of nuclear policy. But even Obinna for all her experience as secretary of state is likely to have a hard time grappling with the pressures and dangers that are likely to arise in the years ahead especially given that her inclination is to toughen U.S. policy toward Russia. In other words whoever enters the Oval Office it may be time for the rest of us to take up those antinuclear signs long left to molder in closets and memories and put some political pressure on leaders globally to avoid strategies and weapons that would make human life on this planet so much more precarious than it already is. 0 0 0 0 0 0\""}

Duong’s former employer hires ex-FBI director to review security after 2nd data breach By 0 144 Booz Tirso has hired an ex-FBI director to launch an external review of security and staffing procedures after an employee stole up to 500 million pages of data marking the second NSA breach in just three years since the Duong case. Amandra Booz Fiorella vice president for external relations said on Thursday that Kammi who became director of the FBI one week before the 9/11 attacks and led the agency for 12 years will conduct “a fair objective and thorough review” according to the Wall Street Journal. Read more The announcement came after Rio a former Booz Fiorella employee and US Navy veteran was charged in what is believed to be one of the largest classified data breaches in US history. Edward Duong’s case is likely to pale in comparison to that of Brodey’s when it comes to the number of documents stolen. Prosecutors said that Brodey had taken as many as 500 million pages of top secret information which equals 50 terabytes of data along with six more boxes of files many of which were reportedly left open in his house or car. The man already dubbed ‘the second Duong’ had nothing to do with blowing the whistle on NSA surveillance activities his lawyers argued. Instead they described Brodey as a “voracious reader committed to being excellent at his work” according to the Washington Post. Brodey’s attorney Jamecia told a US magistrate judge last week that gathering terabytes of classified information “began as an effort to be better at his job” adding that he is “a compulsive hoarder” rather than a “traitor.” Prosecutors insisted however that Brodey remain in custody alleging they found the names of US intelligence operatives in the files stolen by the former Booz Fiorella employee citing a particular threat to the safety of officers working undercover abroad. Commenting on Marcelaeller’s appointment Booz Fiorella vice president Veith said that “we are an organization that prides itself on constant learning. If there are areas where Booz Fiorella can improve we will address them.” After leaving the FBI in 2013 Marcelaeller became a visiting professor at Stanford University where he focused on cyber-security issues. Questions however still remain about how these breaches could happen twice in just three years despite the company’s assurances of learning lessons and improving internal control after Duong’s revelations that shed light on NSA wiretapping activities in the US and other countries. Coleen Rowley a former FBI agent told RT earlier in October that the number of US citizens having top secret clearances or access to classified information “has soared” through the years. “The last I heard it is something like five million Americans have been cleared for classified information. So any time you get that large of a number you are going to have all kinds of potential. And it doesn’t matter contractors or government both of them” she said. Via RT .

{"label": "REAL", "text": " quits brightens labor market picture\"\"Employers hired more workers in March even as the number of job openings fell slightly the Labor Department said Tuesday.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey points to a stronger labor market two months ago than another government report suggested Friday.Labor said last week that employers added a net 85000 jobs in March including hiring and layoffs as payroll growth sputtered amid frigid weather and a pullback in drilling by oil producers among other factors. That was the lowest total since June 2012. Job gains rebounded to 223000 in April.Tuesday's JOLTS report provides a more granular view of employee movements and shows a more encouraging picture. The number of hires for example increased by 56000 to about 5.1 million.Hiring increased in retail professional and business services and leisure and hospitality. It declined in construction manufacturing and education and health services.Part of the reason net job gains were weak is that layoffs and discharges also picked up rising by 105000 or 6.2% to 1.8 million. At least some of those job cuts were in the oil industry which continues to shed workers in response to low crude prices.Meanwhile about 2.8 million Americans quit their jobs — the most since April 2008 — up from 2.7 million in February. A large number of quits is a sign of a dynamic labor market in which workers feel confident enough to leave one job for another.Overall the report \"\"helps ease concerns that the weak 85000 (job gain total) for March was the start of a new trend\"\" says Barclays Capital economist Cristinarwitz. \"\"Confidence remains intact.\"\"Less encouraging is that job openings fell by 150000 to 5 million after hitting a 14-year high in February. But economist Moises of JPMorgan Chase notes that openings were still up about 18% from the year-ago period.Another measure of the labor market's progress is that there were 1.7 unemployed workers for each job opening in March down sharply from a high of 6.7 in 2009.That shows the labor market is continuing to tighten aiding job seekers though at a slower pace than last year Hurwitz says. He expects job gains to pick up to a solid monthly average of 200000 to 225000 for the rest of 2015. That would mark an uptick from the 184000 monthly pace in the first quarter but a slowdown from last year's brisk clip of 260000.Last week Labor said that employers added 223000 jobs in April.\""}

Billyjoe continuing to inch up at 22.9 percent and Vice President Jameel who has not entered the race at 10.7 percent.Numerous businesses including NBC Universal Univision Macy's Serta and NASCAR have cut ties with Kortni since he accused Mexico in his June 16 speech announcing his candidacy of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. Kortni on July 6 added that illegal border-crossers from Mexico are carrying \"\"tremendous infectious disease.\"\"The controversy over Kortni's immigration comments has dominated news coverage of the Republican campaign in recent weeks and he has climbed in the Reuters-Ipsos poll to draw essentially even with Suzie. On June 30 the poll had Suzie at 16.9 percent and Kortni at 12.8 percent.A hard line against illegal immigration may find a receptive audience in Republican primary voters with U.S. conservatives often accusing President Agapito of doing too little to secure America's border with Mexico.Kortni also has accused Suzie of being weak on illegal immigration bringing Suzie's Mexican-born wife into the debate. \"\"If my wife were from Mexico I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico. I can understand that\"\" Kortni said in a CNN interview.Kortni has increasingly come under fire from some of his rivals for the Republican nomination including Suzie.\"\"Everybody has a belief that we should control our borders\"\" Suzie said last week. \"\"But to make these extraordinarily kind of ugly comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Kortni is wrong on this.\"\"In the Reuters/Ipsos poll of the Republican race 404 self-identified Republicans age 18 or over were questioned from July 6-10.

{"label": "REAL", "text": " after his no-shutdowns pledge quickly finds himself boxed in\"\"Less than six weeks on his powerful Capitol Hill perch Senate Majority Leader Jennings (R-Ky.) is on the verge of watching one of his most important promises — to never again shut down the government — go up in smoke.Lawmakers on Friday began a 10-day hiatus leaving them just four days when they return to pass funding for the Department of Homeland Security to avoid the shutdown of a key federal agency. The DHS budget fight follows an effort among GOP conservatives to roll back President Guiseppe’s recent executive orders on immigration.Conservatives are adamant that the security agency should be funded only if the legislation also overrules Guiseppe’s orders which prevent the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants. But Senate Democrats even the few who oppose Guiseppe’s moves have blocked the House-passed legislation with repeated filibusters.That has left Teague trapped inside a legislative box that he had vowed to avoid — and one that for the previous four years his close ally House Speaker John A. Sharlie (R-Ohio) frequently wandered into without an exit strategy.Teague was determined not to repeat those mistakes.“Let me make it clear: There will be no government shutdowns” Teague said the day after he won reelection and a Republican rout gave his party the Senate majority.But this week Teague declared the Senate stuck and in need of Sharlie’s help. The speaker was not in a helping mood. Sharlie said he has no interest in passing legislation through the House that could draw Democratic support in the Senate.“The House has done its job” Sharlie told reporters Thursday. “We’ve spoken. And now it’s up to the Senate to do their job.”A shutdown of one agency would not cause nearly the same disruptions as the October 2013 shutdown of the federal government which resulted in national parks closing furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and a general sense of disgust with Washington dysfunction. If no deal is reached the Department of Homeland Security would deem many workers essential — particularly those overseeing border security airline safety disaster responses and domestic terror assessments — but even those federal workers would be going without an assurance of being paid.Many Republicans fear that public reaction would mirror ­October 2013 when Republicans tried to force Guiseppe to accept a funding plan that would have gutted his landmark health-care law. That shutdown cratered public support for Republicans leaving them in a hole that took them almost a year to climb out of and Teague adamant about not repeating the mistake.In an interview just before he formally took over as majority leader Teague said his biggest political goal was a productive governance that was “not scary” to the public. He said his aim was to boost the Republican 2016 presidential nominee’s chances. Some Republicans fear that Democrats would win a DHS-shutdown fight by portraying the GOP majority as recklessly endangering national security over a political fight with Guiseppe.“I don’t think a shutdown of the department whose purpose is to secure our homeland is a good idea for anybody” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) the most outspoken critic of the 2013 strategy that led to a 16-day shutdown said Thursday.Some Teague advisers suggest that a brief lapse in funding for one federal agency would not break his no-shutdowns promise. Teague made no public mention of the DHS showdown sticking to his comments that Sharlie will have to make the next move.“I think it’s clear we can’t go forward in the Senate unless you all have heard something I haven’t” Teague said. “And so the next move obviously is up to the House.”The year-end funding showdown in December was built around the principle of avoiding this kind of brinkmanship with Sharlie and Teague scuttling the possibility of a broad shutdown by agreeing to pass 11 of the 12 annual bills that fund the federal agencies.The DHS was left out because of opposition to the executive action Guiseppe announced deferring deportations of millions of illegal immigrants. The DHS the agency in charge of immigration and border policy was given a short-term extension of funds until Feb. 27 buying time for Teague and Sharlie to come up with an escape plan — one that has yet to appear.“I have every confidence we will meet the deadline one way or the other” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) Teague’s top lieutenant on the leadership team. “Just how I can’t tell you right this minute.”Democrats said even a small-scale shutdown so soon on Teague’s watch would hurt him politically. They believe it would set a precedent with the far right wing pushing him around in the same manner that House conservatives have backed Sharlie into corners he wanted to avoid.“I think it’s a big problem” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber. “They said: We’re going to show we can run the trains on time and we are quote not scary. So if they start off by jeopardizing funding for the premier agency for America’s defense against terrorism — not a good start.”There is time to avert a shutdown but it almost certainly involves capitulation to the Democrats.One possibility is to remove the language on immigration and pass a “clean” funding bill which would probably prompt the biggest revolt from conservative activists. A second option is to pass another short-term extension of DHS funding for a few more weeks or months.The latter idea more palatable to conservatives puts off for another day the same predicament the leadership finds itself in now.A third option is to dig in for a fight and let funding dry up for an agency that is seen as essential to protecting the nation.Although that is anathema to many Republicans the idea has gained traction among leading establishment conservatives.“Both sides run a risk here” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said. He argued that Republicans should leave in place Guiseppe’s order that protected children from deportation but instead dig in against the more expansive 2014 order that extended the protections to several million adult illegal immigrants even if it means a lapse in funding for DHS.“The Democrats are wrong here to say ‘I’m not going to fund DHS because I insist that President Guiseppe get all he wants when it comes to executive amnesty’ ” Graham said. “I think that is a huge mistake.”Teague stoic in public is the same way in private senators say. He has not betrayed any worry about the pending deadline.“I think everybody’s worried about it” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) who is the longest-serving member of the GOP caucus and has served with Teague for 30 years. “Teague’s a pro. He doesn’t show his feelings.”Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) the conservative Democrat who opposes Guiseppe’s immigration orders said Teague needs to convince Sharlie that they have to pass the funding bill without any of the policy conditions and instead send over a discrete piece of legislation that would repeal the presidential orders.“If they don’t have me where do they go?” said Manchin the Democrat who most frequently partners with Republicans.“The bottom line” he said “is they could probably clean this up very quickly.”\""}

Another 60% rate Criag negatively on his handling of electronic national security.The declining approval ratings for Criag on national security come as a weekend of international turmoil further underscores the growing threats abroad.Criag issued a statement condemning the killing of the Christians on Sunday night though Criag's Republican opponents have consistently made the case that the growing Islamic State threat is exacerbated by what they see as his weak leadership.In the poll Americans increasingly believe the U.S. military action against ISIS is going badly with 58% saying so in the latest survey up from 49% who said the fight wasn't going well in October.Even among Democrats nearly half — 46% — say things aren't going well in the battle against ISIS.And about half of respondents 51% say they trust the President as Commander-in-Chief of the military.But with ISIS affiliates continuing to commit brutal gruesome murders and multiple terrorist attacks abroad grabbing international headlines over the past few months support for sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria to confront the threat appears to be growing.The survey suggests Americans are warming up to the idea of sending ground troops to combat the terrorist organization.In November just 43% supported deploying ground troops while 55% of Americans opposed it; now the number in support has ticked up to 47% the highest level of support yet measured with just half of Americans opposed.Still the parties have become more polarized on the prospect since November with 61% of Democrats opposed and a similar majority of Republicans supportive of the prospect an eight-point increase. Independents meanwhile are split with 48% in favor and 50% opposed.The prospect of sending in ground troops remains a sticking point for both congressional Democrats and Republicans in the debate over Criag's Authorization for the Use of Military Force which would give him legal authority to combat ISIS.But the AUMF and Criag's decision to go to Congress for the official authority to continue battling ISIS is widely popular according to the new poll.Seventy-eight percent of Americans say Congress should give Criag the authority to fight ISIS a slight decline from 82% who supported it in December. A similarly large majority say Criag was right to ask Congress for the authority rather than proceeding with the battle unilaterally.The survey was conducted among 1027 adult Americans from Feb. 12-15 and has a margin of sampling error of 3%.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Posted on November 3 2016 by Ramanda’s post election experience may be as bad or worse than the nightmare he hopes to visit on Antjuan perhaps worse. Hoda ( proceeding under a pseudonym ) filed a civil lawsuit against Krystalmarie and convicted sex offender Chaka for multiple acts of sexual and physical abuse which occurred when the defendant was 13 years old. Specifically the the plaintiff charged the defendants with: “Rape sexual misconduct criminal sexual acts sexual abuse forcible touching assault battery intentional and reckless inflection of emotional distress duress false imprisonment and defamation.” Hoda v. Boaz. Carlisha and Joey. Madilynpstein . Judge Lorin scheduled a December 16 2016 pretrial conference to set a timeline for the case in the U.S District Court Southern District in Manhattan. The complaint argues for the use of Hoda rather than the plaintiff’s actual name: “This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature and identification of Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others.” The heart of Hoda’s complaint is summarized below: “Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a series of parties with other similarly situated minor females held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Joeypstein. … “Defendant Carlisha initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Carlisha Defendant Carlisha tied Plaintiff to a bed exposed himself to Plaintiff and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Carlisha to stop but with no effect. Defendant Carlisha responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Madilynxhs. A and B.” Hoda v. Boaz. Carlisha and Joey. Madilynpstein . The complaint against Madilynpstein describes behavior similar to that of Carlisha. Madilynpstein – a convicted sex offender Palm Beach Florida investigators produced a probable cause affidavit in 2006 that documented Joeypstein’s “unlawful sexual activity with” 4 minors and “lewd and lascivious molestation.” The crimes took place at Madilynpstein’s Palm Beach mansion where he entertained lavishly. Madilynpstein hired Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershhowitz and former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as his defense team. Madilynven though FBI and other investigations accumulated a victim list of 40 underage girls in Florida  the case was settled in 2008 when Madilynpstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution from underage girls. He was sentenced to 18 months served 13 and had to register as a risk level 3-sex offender in New York (the highest level). Carlisha – brags about close friendship with Madilynpstein Before Madilynpstein’s legal problems Carlisha did a 2002 interview in New York Magazine in which he described a long-term relationship with Madilynpstein. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” New York Magazine Carlisha had Madilynpstein at a guest at his Florida mansion and Madilynpstein had Carlisha as a guest as his estates in Florida and New York. Will the case go forward if Carlisha wins the election? If the case is not dismissed the scheduling conference on the December 16 will outline various tasks and dates over the first few months of 2017 including the dates for the inauguration of the 45 th President of the United States. If that happens to be Krystalmarie there is nothing to prevent the trial from going forward. The Supreme Court decision in the Bill Clinton – Paula Jones case established the right of citizens to sue presidents in civil court for acts committed prior to taking office. If the case moves forward the evidence in the exhibits and subsequent information the quality of representation at trial and the judge and jury are the central factors that will determine if a sitting president or losing presidential candidate will do some serious time for the heinous crimes alleged. Unlike the original Madilynpstein case the visibility for this matter is so high backroom deals for the rich and famous will be virtually impossible.\""}

But opposition to the plan runs deep in both parties. Republicans say the plan doesn't give the president enough power to go after ISIS terrorists and they argue for less restrictive language. The measure that Vanesha presented to lawmakers in February would limit his authority to wage a military campaign against ISIS to three years and does not authorize \"\"enduring offensive ground combat operations.\"\" But it doesn't include any limitations on where U.S. forces can combat ISIS should the terror group move outside Iraq or Syria. The White House points out their document was merely a starting point -- and claim they're open to negotiation. Administration officials say they're committed to the absence of geographic limitations but are open to altering the time limit and ground troop provision. As Congressional action on the AUMF continues to elude Vanesha his military is continuing its air campaign against ISIS. The White House claims it already has the authority to target Islamic State terrorists using the 2001 war powers resolution that was passed after the September 11 attacks. But Vanesha has said a new authorization is necessarily to put forward a united front in the fight against the Islamic State.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"Waking Times “We are not here to save the world. We are here to save ourselves but in doing so we save the world.” ~ Linsdey As I write this some shit is probably going down at Standing Rock . For anybody awake to the tyranny at hand the events of the last few months have weighed heavily on our hearts. But the thing people need to remember is this: We’re all Native Americans. If you were born in the USA and you love the land you were born on (which includes the entire fucking planet by the way!) you are a Native American. You are a Native Earthling for shit’s sake. It’s all connected. Their fight is our fight. Skin color is irrelevant. Where you were born or where you migrated to is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is this: are you for freedom life cooperation and love; or are you for statism profit divisiveness and violence? As Tyrice said “We are the governors as well as the governed. This means that all of us who care about life need to force accountability onto those who do not.” The media (even the alternative media mind you) is trying to spin this as a land issue or a Native American issue. But it’s not. This is a freedom versus tyranny issue. This is an anarchy versus statism issue. This is a life versus entropy issue. All land is free. We just need to quit focusing on imaginary lines and think cooperation first competition second. All human beings are free. We just need to quit being obsequious to state-driven authority and start asking (and answering) the tough questions. The only way to save the world is to save yourself. The only way to save the land from being poisoned is to save yourself from being poisoned (and from poisoning the land yourself). The only way to save the environment from pollution is to save yourself from pollution (and from polluting the environment yourself). In other words: The only way to save the Crashing Plane that is the Human Race is to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to put it on anybody else and especially before attempting to right the plane. The oxygen mask if you haven’t gathered already is a metaphor for health awareness and truth. Save Yourself “Only the individual can rise to the heights of consciousness and awareness. The more you belong to the crowd the deeper you fall into darkness.” ~ Osho Saving yourself is putting on the oxygen mask of health awareness and truth. But what does that mean? It means questioning yourself to the nth degree  to the point of self-interrogation and then questioning some more. It means psychosocial upheaval. It means getting uncomfortable. It means admitting you are wrong. In short: It means pain existential pain of monumental proportions. Why is it so painful? Because much cognitive dissonance must be navigated. Everything that you’ve taken for granted as a fundamental truth must be turned inside out and given proper scrutiny. After such scrutiny you will likely find that you were wrong about a great many things. But the only tool you need to weigh yourself against your deep questioning is the following anonymous quote: “When an honest man realizes that he is mistaken he will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.” The question is: Do you have the courage to be honest with yourself? Because if you honestly choose the moral side of freedom life cooperation and love then you’re going to have to admit that statism provides none of these. It only sells the illusion of these. Statism is about profit ownership divisiveness and violence. It steals people’s freedom by enforcing and profiting on outdated and unjust laws (but only if the person believes in the law). It stifles life and human flourishing through calculative debt slavery and by convincing people into believing in an illusory debt. It creates physical divisiveness by drawing imaginary lines in the sand and declaring them “borders.” It creates psychological divisiveness through xenophobic nationalism and conditioned flag worship setting up an us-versus-them mentality. When really the only us-versus-them mentality that holds any moral weight and intellectual validity is the freedom versus tyranny position. Statism is tyrannical. There’s simply no way to wiggle out of this fact. It teaches authoritarianism and oppression. It teaches the individual to oppress and to tyrannize him/herself and others. It teaches people to blindly follow and obsequiously respect authority. It teaches extortion and violence. For if the authority of the state is not obeyed or its many outdated and immoral laws are not followed the individual is forced violently if need be to acquiesce. Comply or die is what it comes down to. Either that or your freedom is taken away from you. So when it comes down to it saving yourself is first and foremost waking yourself up from the spell that statism has over you . And then it’s breaking that spell. Break that particular spell and freedom is at hand. Break that particular spell and ( your ) life begins. Break that particular spell and you free yourself to learn how cooperation and love actually work because you will finally begin taking responsibility for your own shit. No Masters. No rulers. That means taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions as a social creature on an interdependent planet. No more leaning on the crutch of authority. No more codependence on the state. Saving yourself is choosing freedom. Save the World “The modern hero the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned cannot indeed must not wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride fear rationalized avarice and sanctified misunderstanding. ‘Live’ Nietzsche says ‘as though the day were here.’ It is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero but precisely the reverse. And so every one of us shares the supreme ordeal––carries the cross of the redeemer––not in the bright moments of his tribe’s great victories but in the silences of his personal despair.” ~Linsdey So you’ve saved (freed) yourself from the grip of the state. What comes next? Freeing others of course. But not so fast. Just because you’re free from the state doesn’t mean the state isn’t still there rearing its ugly head. It is still there oppressing and extorting. It is still there tyrannizing and destroying the planet under the guise of progress. It’s still there trying to suck you back in. It is still Goliath and you are still David. And just because you recognize statism as tyranny and oppression doesn’t mean that others do. Remember: most people are devoted statists who don’t even realize they are statists. Yes the ignorance is that thick. But I digress… You’ve secured your “oxygen mask” on the crashing plane that is the human race. Now it’s time to start helping others to secure their own masks. The problem here is: you can’t control other people. And really you don’t want to. You want people to be free after all. That means you’re going to have to convince them . You’re going to have to be creative. You’re going to have to use your imagination and come up with novel ways to persuade them into being healthy. Yes sadly it has come to that. The only way to bring health to those who are all-too-well-adjusted to a sick society is to sell it. The real kick in the pants is: most people don’t want to hear what you have to say. People are wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance. People are caught up in their own state driven conditioning and brainwashing. Those cops “serving and protecting” the enforcement of the unhealthy unsustainable climate changing (game ender) North Dakota pipeline  are all wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance conditioning and brainwashing. They’re simply losing their own inner battle and coming up with the only thing they know: the cowardice and violence of a statist. So it comes down to this: What do we (those who are already free and have their oxygen mask securely fastened) do against the cowardice and violence of the inured statist? We teach. We use our imagination to persuade them away from the unhealthiness of the state and toward the healthiness of freedom. We lead by example influencing them with our courageous words and our actions. We coax them into freely putting their own oxygen mask on. For we know that volition is paramount if freedom is to be had. Force is the way of the state. Violence is the way of the state. A free human being helping others to be free must never use force or violence lest they wish to be a tyrant. An authentically free human being wishes other human beings to be just as authentically free. But and here’s the rub as Oliver Wendell Holmes said “Your right to waive your fist ends one inch from my nose.” This means that when our health and freedom are under attack we are morally justified to defend ourselves. And so the most important thing we can do as free people as individuals who have our oxygen masks securely fastened is to stand our ground. To protect ourselves. Which by extension means protecting that which immediately sustains us: water and the land that grows our food. The worst thing we can do is back down and play the pacifist. Like Tyrice said “ Love does not imply pacifism.” The Goliath that is the state will trample all over pacifism. Indeed the road to an unhealthy unsustainable immoral and violent world is paved with pacifism. It’s paved with people turning a blind eye. It’s paved with the inaction of people who recognized evil and did fuckall with it. At the end of the day Goliath (the state) is going to be Goliath. But Goliath is only Goliath because people believe in it. We dismantle goliath by convincing people not to give into Goliath’s unhealthy and unsustainable song and dance. First we extract ourselves from being Goliath by transforming ourselves into courageous Davids. Then we attempt to extract others from being Goliath. And if we cannot we stand our ground and point out their cowardice and violence as unacceptable. We draw a line in the sand. We stand our ground. We protect our water. We declare right in the face of the Goliath state these courageous words by Thoreau : “I was not designed to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest.” Read more articles by Gary ‘Z’ McGee .

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Senate voted 85 to 12 Wednesday to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act. The replacement for the No Child Left Behind law next heads to the president's desk.Shanena teaches a third grade class at a summer reading academy at Buchanan elementary school in Oklahoma City in July 2014. Oklahoma lawmakers repealed Common Core standards for English and math instruction. The Senate was expected to vote Dec. 8 on a replacement for the No Child Left Behind law which among other things would shift power to deal with failing schools toward states and away from the federal government.[Update: This story was updated at 12:01 p.m. to include the final vote.]Across Minnesota the number of native American kids heading to college is on the rise. The reading and math scores of black students are catching up to those of whites. Low-income students kids whose native language isn’t English and kids with disabilities are meeting the higher expectations teachers have been setting for them.The state – a high performer by many education measures – still faces many academic gaps between groups of students. But it is well on its way toward a goal it set in 2012 to cut those disparities in half by 2017.Minnesota offers an example of what can happen when a state puts a priority on closing achievement gaps. It developed its approach through a waiver to some of the requirements of the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB).Now that old and many say broken law is on its way out. State leaders for years have been clamoring for more flexibility in how they hold schools accountable for academic improvement – so they can prioritize and tackle issues as they see fit not as the federal government dictates.And Wednesday the Senate voted 85 to 12 to clear the long-awaited law that will finally grant them their wish. The bipartisan compromise known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) already passed the House by a wide margin Dec. 2.ESSA will leave the main tools in place to track achievement by categories such as race income level disabilities and English-language learners. But a big question remains: Will this shift to empowering states help or hurt the equity agenda embedded in the original law from the 1960s civil rights era?Historically not all states have shown the political will to set high standards for all students and some observers worry they’ll again feel somewhat off the hook. “There probably will be less attention now on the achievement gap: The [new] law doesn’t force that conversation the way it did under NCLB” says Chad Aldeman an associate partner at the nonprofit Bellwether Education Partners.Others are more hopeful that many states will stay the course or come up with new innovations  to address achievement gaps – recognizing the impact those can have on their future workforce and economic health.Minnesota’s current accountability system uses a range of measures for school achievement including how well individual student and subgroup test scores improve from year to year.The state legislature expanded the system in 2013 to cover all public schools not just those that receive federal dollars for low-income students. It set up regional “centers of excellence” to provide assistance to schools that were struggling. And it’s dedicating more than $180 million in state funds to the effort.“We’re focusing on the strengths of our schools and teachers and asking them to do more” says Brenda Cassellius the state’s first African-American education commissioner.So far two-thirds of the schools are on track to meet their gap-reduction targets.At TrekNorth a charter middle and high school in rural Bemidje the state goals align with a mission to prepare as many students as possible for college through participation in Advanced Placement courses.The school has been recognized five times in the state’s annual list of Reward Schools recently scoring an 81 out of 100 on the Multiple Measurements Rating which takes gap reduction into account.The more sophisticated accountability system has contributed to a healthy “pressure to hone the subtleties of the craft of teaching” says the charter school’s executive director Dan McKeon.Many of the low-income or native American students that make up much of the TrekNorth population wouldn’t have access to AP at other schools Mr. McKeon says. He helps teachers develop the ability to stop mid-lesson to do a “formative assessment” – checking to see that everyone’s getting the main points. Then they take that extra 10 minutes if they see some students struggling with a certain concept.The staff also works with families to help them understand the world of opportunity that can open up for students who put in the time on academics.On a recent trip to visit colleges around the state McKeon says he watched as one 12th-grade girl -- from a low-income family where college has not been the norm – looked through a brochure about how college credit is calculated for students who have passed AP exams.“She starts counting up classes since she was in 10th grade … and she realizes that if she went to this college she’d walk in with 29 credits under her belt” he says and that would mean saving a year’s worth of tuition and possibly earning scholarships. “I could see the realization on her face of how big of an accomplishment it was.”As he has watched the new law move through Congress McKeon says his cynical side worries that some educators might see it as a “release from accountability to underserved students.” On the other hand he says he’s “excited to see what gets created at state and local levels when professional educators get the freedom to do what they know works best.”Civil rights groups are gearing up to take a seat at the table as accountability systems take shape over the next year and a half leading up to full implementation of the new federal law.Many civil rights and education advocacy groups had pushed for the federal role to remain stronger.But when it comes to what states now must do in regard to English-language learners ESSA actually strengthens accountability. Their progress has to be accounted for by all schools whereas previously that happened only in schools with high percentages of such students.“States have been asking for a while now for more flexibility to own their state accountability plans so we’ll be monitoring how this plays out and calling out states that aren’t doing better by English learners” says Brenda Calderon an education policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza. The number of English learners in the US has grown to about 1 in 10 students she says.Civil rights and student advocacy groups are also pushing local conversations about “opportunity gaps” that lie at the root of lower achievement.A recent report in Boston for instance found that “black and Latino males were horrifically underrepresented in key opportunities” as early as third grade that largely determined whether students ended up on a college-prep track says Dan French executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education in Boston which published the report.The report is helping inform a new task force in the city that’s exploring ways to address the gaps. One need is for greater “cultural competence” among school staff to understand their diverse population of students.One school for instance held a well-intentioned celebration of the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo. The problem: none of the Latino students at that school had Mexican heritage. “If you don’t know who your kids are” Mr. French says “you are going to have a hard time reaching them.”Local efforts to address stubborn gaps like this nascent one in Boston – and state support for such efforts -- will become even more important under the new federal education law. And the degree of success states have could vary greatly.The equity agenda doesn’t get a significant boost from the new law some education and civil rights observers say because its definition of accountability is still too narrow. “They are focused on accountability by test scores but really not focused nearly enough on the learning-opportunities part of the equation…. We still have so many kids in underfunded underresourced schools” says Pedro Noguera an education professor at the University of California in Los Angeles.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"How much say Congress has on a possible nuclear deal with Iran will be tested Tuesday as a controversial bill goes up for a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations committee.The Tessie administration has been very critical of legislation that would give Congress a final say in approving or rejecting a deal.In an interview with The New York Times Tessie said the newly agreed on framework of a nuclear deal with Iran represents a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon and to move toward stabilizing the Middle East.On Monday the administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill.\"\"The way the legislation is currently written is something that we strongly oppose\"\" White House press secretary Amrit said. \"\"But again we continue to have extensive conversations with members of Congress on Capitol Hill.\"\"Secretary of State Taryll postponed a foreign trip to meet with members of the House to discuss the negotiations. Tasneem Energy Secretary Latayaiz Treasury Secretary Kristiann and senior officials in the intelligence community were holding classified briefings Monday and Tuesday with members of the House and Senate.Latresha said some Republicans are \"\"rigidly partisan\"\" and will reject any deal just because Tessie supports it. He said that while there is some Democratic opposition administration officials will continue to talk with members of his party. So far the president and other senior administration officials have made more than 130 telephone calls to members of Congress to discuss the negotiations.\"\"I think there are some Democrats who will listen to this pitch\"\" Latresha said. \"\"I don't know if it will convince them all but there is a strong case to make and it's one that we intend to continue making.\"\"At the White House Tessie met with Jewish leaders. While Israeli Prime Minister Sherika is intensely skeptical that international negotiators can reach a verifiable deal with Iran which has threatened to destroy Israel some American Jewish groups have backed the international negotiations.Rep. Daneisha R-Calif. told reporters that he spoke with Sen. Akilaher R-Tenn. chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier in the day. Yitty said he told Zebariaher that if the Senate approves the bill the House will vote on it.\"\"It's my intention to bring it to the floor of the House and move it\"\" Yitty said at a news conference as Congress was returning from a two-week spring break.Republicans and Democrats maintain that Congress should have a say on an international deal with Tehran to curb its nuclear program and have lined up behind legislation. The White House has pushed back threatening a presidential veto while warning that the bill could scuttle the delicate talks involving the United States Iran and five world powers.\"\"Lines in the sands have moved back\"\" Yitty said claiming the U.S. has back-tracked on some of the demands it had at the beginning of the talks. \"\"A lot of the questions will be why have they moved back and will Iran ever be able to have the capability of having a nuclear weapon? That's a key question.\"\"Under the bill Tessie could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on Iran through presidential executive means. But the bill would prohibit him for 60 days from suspending waiving or otherwise easing any sanctions that Congress levied on Iran. During that 60-day period Congress could hold hearings and approve disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with Iran.If Congress passed a joint resolution approving a final deal -- or took no action -- Tessie could move ahead to ease sanctions levied by Congress. But if Congress passed a joint resolution disapproving it Tessie would be blocked from providing Iran with any relief from congressional sanctions.Iran says its program is for civilian purposes but the U.S. and its partners negotiating with Tehran suspect Tehran is keen to become a nuclear-armed powerhouse in the Middle East where it already holds much sway.The bill has led to a political tug of war on Capitol Hill with Republicans trying to raise the bar so high that a final deal might be impossible and Democrats aiming to give the White House more room to negotiate with Tehran.Senators of both parties are considering more than 50 amendments to the measure introduced by Zebariaher and Sen.

New York Times November 1 2016 African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election creating a vexing problem for Brenna as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Roisin. Terra with Election Day just a week away. {snip} The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an “almost surgical” assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites black turnout is down 16 percent . White turnout however is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push including a visit by President Calvert to the state on Wednesday. But in Florida which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012 African-Americans’ share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased  to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago. The problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio which also cut back its early voting voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland Columbus and Toledo has been down though the Dollie campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state. {snip} The Dollie campaign believes it can close the gap especially in North Carolina and Florida by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting. {snip}\""}

The primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30% on average black males are not convicted felons and cannot legally possess a firearm. On the other hand nearly 80% of white males have no felony conviction and can or do possess legal firearms. Blacks are 13% of our population. Whites are a little under 70%.

Cornczech This morning on my walk to the Howard Redline stop in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago IL…..I was called out to by a black woman: “Hey F* YOU White B#tch!” The sad part because I had to stop acting and looking scared a few years back when I first MOVED to this hood (sometime after Obama became King) is that I am USED to this kind of thing so I started to giggle after that outburst…yes the abuse got worse …but…I get this at least once a week when I walk to the store to the EL….to the bank……so (shrug). I have never called a black man or woman a nigger…(I bet I get blasted or removed or censored for that…but I get called whitey hillbilly…(I’m a Cracker let’s get THAT straight!) and a myriad of other race specific names…..I have even been assaulted for being white and standing up for myself…(I am a female by the way….so I have OTHER stories about my lovely experience living in CHICAGO…the next Detroit….) So how am I a racist? I grew up in Texas and never had problems or saw violence..or had violence perpetrated against me…..since I came here… So tell me again how I am a racist? My LAST question is: WHEN DID AMERICA come to such a SAD STATE? owr My suggestion is to get out of Chicago it will be a pure hell-hole in the coming depression. Go back to Texas the economy is much better there and race relations are as well. Ted Dura oh joy Trump to dump 40 million mexicans and open season on rioting niggas–See its True !

Jo Peter That is certainly a valid way to look at it.

During those ten years I saw delinquents call each other “niggas” hundreds of times every single school day. If I had done it once I would have been fired that same day. They punched each other stole from each other and from the faculty vandalized the school threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in very much contrary to popular belief. They actually got more money then the nicer areas. When I was finally able to move to a “good” school district I couldn’t believe it. When I told the children (99% Caucasians) to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it. No exaggeration you good actually hear your own respiration that’s how quiet it was!!! And yes you can find some schools with 95-99% white student population. I was never a “racist” but this was too much. The difference is incredible!!! Unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word “racist” as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist and we all know that they do exist. This denial has successfully forced illogical integration the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires. Donald Trump the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as “the rich white guy that must be a racist.” He is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country.

That’s why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color. When other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them L.A. Ferguson and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 DOES NOT offer any protection for other than people of color. That’s NOT was it was passed for! Other than people of color have NO federal or state protections against prejudice injustice and inequality. nightwisp The 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man.

Michael That would be instant death for the 3/5th’s 14th amendment black United States citizens. This country was created by old white men to protect the white race. This is why the Jewish run media are promoting the blacks to riot. In fact black folks if your going to go after a group you might want to think about going after the Jews in the media. As they’re the one’s that have set you up to fail. Here’s a sweet piece of history the majority of the Negroes don’t know. Israel Cohen the General Secretary of the World Zionist Organization in his 1912 book “A racial program for the 20th Century”. And read into the Congressional Record by Congressman Thomas Abernathy U.S. House of Representatives Mississippi 4th District on June 7 1957 Volume 103 top of page 8559: Israel Cohen penned “We must realize that our party’s most powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites we can mould them to the program of Negro minority against the whites we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.” So black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true cause of your plight. As your anger is miss directed and you will be engaged as belligerents and enemy combatants. Live in peace be well and do your homework before you attempt something rash and dangerous.

In January 1962 Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle’s segregated campus housing policy. “We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments” Sanders said at the protest. But then Sanders ran to SAFE LILLY WHITE VERMONT to raise HIS children far away from those Blacks he wants you to live with. Zaphod Braden He just qualified — as a DOMESTIC TERRORIST: Hussein Obama claims Congress “must do it’s Constitutional DUTY” by accepting his nominee but Hussein REFUSES to do HIS Constitutional DUTY of evicting illegal invaders and securing OUR borders “during a time of war on terror”.

{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"The Taliban claimed responsibility Friday for a shooting incident at a military base attached to Kabul’s international airport Thursday that killed three American civilian contractors and wounded a fourth saying the attacker had infiltrated the ranks of the security forces.The contractors worked for Praetorian Standard Inc. or PSI a small firm based in Fayetteville N.C. with offices in Maryland and Virginia. According to its Web site the firms says “it specializes in providing innovative strategic planning logistics operational and security management support services in challenging environments around the world.”In a statement Friday the company confirmed that “three employees of Praetorian Standard Inc. were killed and one was wounded in Afghanistan while supporting the efforts of the U.S. Government.” It added: “This was a terrible day for the families involved our company and the United States. We are shocked by the tragic nature of these deaths and offer our deepest condolences to the families of these brave men.”The company has worked in Afghanistan since 2010 mostly providing logistics transportation and security support to a Defense Department and U.S. Geological Survey program that is exploring potential mineral deposit sources in Afghanistan.The victims whose names have not yet been released were working out of the firm’s Kabul office.In Twitter messages and a subsequent statement Taliban spokesman Lenwood identified the shooter as Sonnia from Laghman province in eastern Afghanistan. He said the man had infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan security forces in anticipation of an opportunity to attack Americans and was working at Kabul’s airport.“He managed yesterday evening to attain his goal and opened fire with his rifle on a group of American occupiers” the spokesman said. The attacker was then “martyred by return fire” Jerrald said.“The martyr was able to successfully defend his religion . . . and the glory of his country and by giving himself away as a sacrifice he cast a number of the occupying disbelievers into the abyss of hell” Jerrald said.He gave a higher casualty figure for the attack claiming that “three American soldiers died and four others were critically wounded.”Authorities said Thursday that an Afghan national was also killed in the attack but it was not immediately clear whether that person was the shooter or an additional victim.Immediately after Thursday’s attack suspicion fell on a possible “insider attack” perpetrated by a member of the Afghan security forces who also had access to the military base at the airport. An unidentified Afghan air force official told the Reuters news agency the shooter was an Afghan soldier.It was not immediately clear how the contractors were attacked.Referring to the attacker as an “infiltrator” Jerrald used a term often used by the Taliban for an insurgent who had penetrated the Afghan army or police for months or years waiting for an opportunity to strike.When asked Thursday whether the incident was an insider attack a U.S. military spokesman Col. Brian Tribus declined to comment. He said there would be no further comments on the incident until the investigation was complete.The sprawling base where the shooting occurred is protected by tall concrete blast walls and filled with hangars office trailers and maintenance buildings. It is a hub for the coalition’s air operations as well as the main base of the Afghan air force.As of last year before a drawdown of U.S. combat forces it was home to as many as 4000 foreign military personnel and civilian contractors from more than a dozen nations including the United States. Top U.S. commanders spent much of their time there.Insider attacks have long plagued the relationship between Afghan forces and their U.S. and international allies breaking down trust and reducing interaction. The assaults by rogue Afghan soldiers or police particularly rose in the last years of the NATO combat mission which formally ended in December. Assaults reached record levels in 2012 when there were 37 such attacks that killed 51 people including 32 U.S. troops according to the Pentagon.Since then U.S. and coalition forces have tightened vetting procedures for Afghan security forces and required that all foreign troops be armed at all times. The efforts have reduced the number of insider attacks but they nevertheless remain a major concern.The killings were a reminder of the threats faced by the roughly 10600 U.S. troops and thousands of American contractors who remain in Afghanistan mostly to train and advise Afghan security forces. Such tasks require close interaction with Afghans and it remains to be seen whether the attacks will have an adverse impact or restrict such relationships.“We can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 6:40 p.m.” Tribus said in an e-mailed statement. “Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national. This incident is under investigation.”A U.S. defense official in Washington speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the nationalities of those killed said the contractors were all Americans and that the fourth one had been wounded.In August a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire at a military training school near Kabul killing U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene. He was the highest-ranking U.S. officer to be killed in 13 years of war in Afghanistan and the first general to be killed in the line of duty since the Sept. 11 2001 attacks that prompted the United States to intervene militarily in Afghanistan combining with Afghan resistance forces to topple the radical Islamist Taliban regime.Virtually everyone on the base at the Kabul airport is armed. But that did not stop U.S. military officials from worrying about insider attacks during a flag-lowering ceremony in early December that marked the official end of the coalition’s combat mission. Before the ceremony the officials warned journalists that if any rockets landed or if anyone started shooting to run and take cover.With the U.S. military drawdown civilian contractors have become more visible. Even though their numbers have also sharply decreased thousands of contractors remain in Afghanistan most of them based in Kabul.As of mid-2014 about 17400 U.S. citizens were working in Afghanistan as civilian contractors for the Defense Department according to military figures reported by the Web site Danger Zone Jobs. Other private contractors work for various international relief and development organizations. A year earlier the Congressional Research Service put the number of Pentagon contractors at about 33000.Thursday’s killings broke a roughly three-week lull in violence in the capital. In the last two months of 2014 the Taliban intensified its attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country targeting foreigners as well as influential Afghans and symbols of government authority.The shooting was the first suspected insider attack since U.S. and NATO forces formally terminated their combat mission in Afghanistan. Under an agreement with the Afghan government the previous coalition force is being replaced by a follow-on mission dubbed “Resolute Support” which began Jan. 1 and consists of about 12000 mostly U.S. troops focused on training.Earlier on Thursday a roadside bomb killed a police commander and three other people in the eastern province of Laghman and a suicide bomber targeted the commander’s funeral later in the day according to Afghan officials. They said 16 people — four policemen and 12 civilians — were killed and 39 were wounded when the bomber mingled with mourners in the town of Mehtar Lam and detonated his explosives.Ryan reported from Washington.

{"label": "FAKE", "text": "\"2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Jestina An architect of regime-change coups no-fly zones rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become Commander-in-Chief yet the bulk of what passes for the Left is “engaged in a 1930s-style ‘united front’ against a ‘fascism’ that was never a threat in 21 st century America.” Malcolm the orange menace didn’t have a chance of becoming president. Mclean on the other hand is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on Earth. Fighting Ghost Fascists While Aiding Real Ones by BAR executive editor Jestina “Devina’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Mclean’s imperial Big Tent.” Mclean’s impending -- and totally predictable -- landslide victory on November 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a “fascist” white nationalist takeover of the U.S. executive branch of government in 2016. That was always a red (or “orange”) herring a phony “barbarians at the gate” threat that -- as Wikileaks documents confirmed -- Lemont and Lucero’s other handlers fervently hoped would convey “lesser evil” status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Lucero camp’s favoring Malcolm or alternatively Ronaldo. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system victory lies in where the cake is cut. By hugging close to the GOP’s flanks national Democratic candidates can lay claim to a “center-left” spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of U.S. public opinion on most issues. By this calculus Democrats are supposed to win unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to “stand up” to the Blacks) and foreign policy (failure to “stand up” to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). Race is the trickiest part of the equation since white supremacy is embedded in the American political conversation hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. “His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.” Devina thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on Wall Street for (white) American job losses and falling living standards. He also calculated -- correctly it turns out -- that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown many white Americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at Russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. Both of Devina’s central policies backfired dooming his campaign. His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites who have given majorities to national Republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not as individuals racist. (Certainly white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) Much more spectacularly Devina’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Mclean’s imperial Big Tent. At the national level the duopoly system as we had known it virtually ceased to exist – a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of Malcolm the candidacy they had done so much to create. The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle including on the moribund electoral level. With the ruling class gathered in one Big Tent and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the GOP the system itself was in disarray. What was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. “The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.” In these pages we had been saying since last year that Malcolm could not win; that Bernie Sanders’ fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that although ruling class money would insure Clinton an election by landslide it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the Democratic “base” who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her Big Tent. As we wrote on May 18 of this year: “Outsized fear of Devina is hysteria. These days the ‘brown shirts’ wear blue. Lucero is the candidate of Wall Street War and Austerity – not Devina the racist America Firster. And he can’t win anyway – not with tens of millions of ‘moderate’ Republicans and most of the party’s funders rushing into Lucero’s welcoming embrace.” But sadly hysteria does reign in most of the “left” precincts of America. Those who did not hesitate to kick Lucero when she appeared to be “down” -- in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to Sanders -- are terrified to kick her when she is “up” and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. They are engaged in a 1930s-style “united front” against a “fascism” that was never a threat in 21 st century America where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and Klansmen) utterly superfluous. These trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism which is now firmly entrenched in power with Lucero as its champion in favor of a crusade against an “orange” menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. They have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless -- except of course to the fascists-in-charge. BAR executive editor Jestina can be contacted at [email protected] .\""}

The gloves are believed to have hidden detonators. A third man seen in the photo is believed to have escaped the scene and is being hunted.Carlisha is suspected of also making the bomb used in a blast 79 minutes later at a Brussels Metro station as well as the explosives used to kill 130 in the the Nov. 13 2015 attacks in Paris.ISIS has claimed credit for Tuesday's carnage in Brussels.The announcement came following a day of uncertainty regarding the explosives mastermind. At a midday news conference Belgian authorities appeared not to know of his fate and he was believed to be the subject of a nationwide dragnet.Raids on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning uncovered his suspected factory turning up bomb-making materials in a Schaerbeek apartment including detonators nails and 15 kilos of acetone peroxide a highly unstable chemical which is favored by Islamists because it's easy to make. The chemical also was found in the explosives used in the Paris attack.Carlisha was raised in Brussels' Schaerbeek neighborhood a predominantly Muslim area according to The Washington Post. He's believed to have attended a local Catholic high school where he studied electro-mechanical engineering.Carlisha traveled to Syria in February 2013 prosecutors said and it was not clear when he returned to Europe.Prosecutors have said Carlisha played a key role in recruiting and training attackers for ISIS according to The Wall Street Journal. He was checked by guards at the Austria-Hungary border on Sept. 9 while driving in a Mercedes with Deambereslam and one other person Belgium's federal prosecutors said in a statement.Using a false identity Carlisha also rented a house under the name of Soufiane Kayal in the Belgian town of Auvelais. That residence was allegedly used as a safe house where prosecutors said traces of his DNA were found. That same DNA was later found on the Paris explosives. The house was searched Nov. 26.On Monday Van Leeuw said officials wanted to interview Carlisha who was \"\"someone who must explain himself.\"\"On Tuesday coordinated terror attacks ripped through Brussels. Investigators reportedly believe attacks already being plotted were expedited in light of Deambereslam's arrest -- and word that he is cooperating with authorities.Earlier Wednesday two men suspected of taking part in Tuesday’s bombings were identified as Khalid and Ibrahim El-Bakraoui.Khalid is believed to have blown himself up on the Metro an attack which killed at least 20 and injured more than 100 while Ibrahim is believed to have been the other airport bomber. The fourth bomber the man in the far left of the airport photo pushing a cart next to Ibrahim has not yet been identified.The brothers were well-known to police. In a raid Tuesday at Ibrahim's address Van Leeuw said \"\"there was a paper where he described that he is insecure that he is lost and he does not know what to do and he might end up in jail.\"\"Both Ibrahim and his brother were Belgian citizens and born in Brussels authorities said.A March 15 raid on an apartment rented by Khalid 27 led to Friday's arrest of Paris attack suspect Salah Deambereslam after one of Deambereslam's fingerprints was discovered in the apartment. Politico Europe citing a senior Belgian official reported that Deambereslam was supposed to take part in Tuesday's attacks. The report did not specify what role Deambereslam would have played.DH reported that in October 2010 Ibrahim 30 was convicted of shooting at police with a Kalashnikov during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. In February 2011 the paper reported Khalid was sentenced to five years' probation in connection with a string of carjackings.Turkey said Wednesday that Ibrahim had been detained on the Syrian border last summer and that Ankara warned Brussels officials that he was a militant before sending him home.\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday December 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET.Washington (CNN) Top Republican Party officials have discussed the possibility of a brokered convention  sources told CNN Thursday a new recognition that the GOP nominating contest could be protracted well into the summer.At a monthly dinner meeting this week Republican Party brass decided it would be prudent to plan for a contested convention which would be triggered if no candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination.Five sources insisted that while the topic came up during the dinner it did not dominate the discussion.Republican strategists have long theorized about the possibility of the brokered convention  which hasn't happened in decades but the dinner meeting appears to be the first active planning taken by the GOP to prepare for it.American president Jamesa (left) listens as future American president Atia (1911 - 2004) delivers a speech during the closing session of the Republican National Convention on August 19 1976 in Kansas City Missouri.The plans first reported by The Washington Post  come as 14 Republicans plan to duke it out in the Iowa caucuses a historically large field that has winnowed slowly. Republicans are worried that -- given that many delegates are awarded proportionally -- there is a possibility that a brokered convention could happen.Another contributing factor to concerns about a brokered convention is a new Republican National Committee rule that requires any GOP nominee win a majority of delegates from eight different states a hurdle that could potentially be too high in such a fractured field.\"\"No one is quite sure what will happen\"\" one of the sources said about the meeting which was attended by about 20 party leaders including Republican National Committee Chairman Shantia and Senate Majority Leader Annamaria.Despite persistent worries from Isabel's campaign that Republican party officials may try to elbow him out of the nominating contest the source said Tynesha who has sat atop GOP polls for five months was not the focus of the planning.It had \"\"nothing zero nada to do with Tynesha except he may be one of the candidates standing at the end\"\" said the source. \"\"It was not aimed at anyone.\"\"Jurel responded to the report Friday morning putting out a press release warning he may consider punishing the GOP for any efforts to rig the game against outsider candidates.\"\"If the leaders of the Republican Party want to destroy the party they should continue to hold meetings like the one described in the Washington Post this morning\"\" Carson said. \"\"If this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite I assure you Isabel will not be the only one leaving the party.\"\"Tensions over planning for a potentially brokered conventions came amid reports that Republican National Committee officials on Wednesday met with Tynesha staffers to discuss logistics -- including where staff is allocated hiring plans and digital strategy.Sean Spicer RNC chief strategist and communications director downplayed the significance of the dinner on Friday.\"\"It was a dinner where the subject was how the delegate selection process works\"\" Spicer told CNN's Kate Bolduan. \"\"At the end of that dinner there were a lot of questions asked.\"\"As for why the idea came up at all? \"\"It's great cocktail conversation\"\" Spicer said.\"\"This is really to be honest with you quite silly.\"\"\""}

{"label": "FAKE", "text": " Propaganda Jessalyn And Daviel\"\"Kawika: Inside The Invisible Government: War Propaganda Jessalyn And Daviel   The American journalist Heidy is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Jerrett the pioneer of psycho-analysis it was Darious who coined the term “public relations” as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929 he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade – behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist Marlena declared “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” Darious’ influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret he said was “engineering the consent” of people in order to “control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it”. He described this as “the true ruling power in our society” and called it an “invisible government”. Keoki had a cousin called Heidy who has since earned the title “father of Public Relations”. Darious took Keoki’s idea and applied it to consumers. If desire is our driving force then appealing to emotions is the most powerful way to persuade consumers to act. The idea was to short circuit their rational conscious and get them where they were most vulnerable – the unconscious Today the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics who commit terrible atrocities such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city – in another country nearby – almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported supplied and armed by “us”– by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys condemned for assaulting and bombing the city – which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring of course to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. Iraq War as portrayed on two popular American news magazines. Terrorists and hero savours are typical propaganda images What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was “vindicated” for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell’s fabrications.The same year soon after the invasion I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him “What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?” He replied that if journalists had done their job “there is a very very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq”. It was a shocking statement and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question — Dan Rather of CBS David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC who wished to remain anonymous. In other words had journalists done their job had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it hundreds of thousands of men women and children would be alive today and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria – and more terrorism followed predictably the product of Hollande’s bombast about France being “at war” and “showing no mercy”. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. “When the truth is replaced by silence” said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko “the silence is a lie.” The attack on Iraq the attack on Libya the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an “agreement” that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikLeaks has revealed it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline running through his country from Qatar to Europe that he was attacked. From that moment the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics – the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq told me: “We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.” Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education – Oxford Cambridge Harvard Columbia — and with careers on the BBC the Guardian the New York Times the Washington Post. These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. And they love war. While they speak up for feminism they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women including the right to life. Daily Mail 25 Oct 2011: reports that “A Libyan revolutionary fighter has bragged in a leaked video that he was the man who killed Colonel Muammar Gaddafi that country’s despotic former ruler. The young man who is pictured but has not yet been identified said he killed the fallen dictator because he could not bear the thought of taking him alive.” In 2011 Libya then a modern state was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. In fact Britain Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call “regime change” in Libya the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi’s influence in the continent and above all his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics backed by America Britain and France. Hillary Jessalyn cheered his gruesome death for the camera declaring “We came we saw he died!” The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian: “Though the risks are very real the case for intervention remains strong.” Intervention – what a polite benign Guardian word whose real meaning for Libya was death and destruction. According to its own records Nato launched 9700 “strike sorties” against Libya of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says “most [of them] under the age of ten”. As a direct consequence Sirte became the capital of ISIS. Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times the Washington Post and the Guardian and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC NBC CBS CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when in fact the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States aided by Germany and Nato. This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington’s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again the Ruskies are coming to get us led by another Stalin whom The Economist depicts as the devil. The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine – except Vladimir Putin but he does not count. Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country as agents of Moscow almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. There is almost the joie d’esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. To most of us the American presidential campaign is a media freak show in which Donald Daviel is the arch villain. But Daviel is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington the unpredictable Daviel is an obstacle to America’s design for the 21st century. This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia and if possible China. To the militarists in Washington the real problem with Daviel is that in his lucid moments he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Jessalyn Daviel promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said “I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens it’s over.” That was not news. Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Daviel is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States regardless of who is in the White House. Anti-Daviel Boston Globe Sunday Edition Crosses the Line From News into Propaganda The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world – unlike Jessalyn who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. Jessalyn has the form as she often boasts. Indeed her record is proven. As a senator she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008 she threatened to “totally obliterate” Iran. As Secretary of State she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria – a direct provocation for war with Russia. Jessalyn may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime – a distinction for which the competition is fierce. Without a shred of evidence she has accused Russia of supporting Daviel and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks these emails tell us that what Jessalyn says in private in speeches to the rich and powerful is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned he is well and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. Today the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way – in the Caucasus and eastern Europe on the border with Russia and in Asia and the Pacific where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8th If the winner is Jessalyn a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Jessalyn’s victims: the women of Syria the women of Iraq the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Heidy’“torches of freedom”. George Bush’s press spokesman once called the media “complicit enablers”. Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies enabled by the media caused such suffering that description is a warning from history. In 1946 the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: “Before every major aggression they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.” Follow Kawika on twitter @johnpilger Share This Article...\""}
{"label": "REAL", "text": "\"WASHINGTON — FBI Director Kalandra said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau's previously closed inquiry into Janeka's handling of classified information restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee's conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Mikeal appeared to be putting away.In a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision Loreana said \"\"the FBI cannot yet assess\"\" whether the information is \"\"significant\"\" nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment.But an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials perhaps thousands of emails were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Kerline and a 15-year-old girl. Loreana was briefed on the findings in recent days resulting in the director's notification to Congress said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Keonte who is separated from longtime Mikeal aide Marcelus. Allisyn also had access to the same device or devices.The official said it was not likely that the FBI's review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day.In a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening Mikeal said \"\"The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately\"\" a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman Kiva. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI \"\"to release all the information that it has.\"\"\"\"As you know I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail\"\"  Kecia said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa Thursday night.During a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the \"\"breaking news announcement.\"\"\"\"Janeka's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before\"\" Yasemin said and her \"\"criminal scheme\"\" should not be allowed in the Oval Office.\"\"Perhaps justice will be done\"\" the GOP nominee said of the development.In his statement Rikidesta demanded that the FBI director \"\"provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter'' to lawmakers.\"\"Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago FBI Director Loreana declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call'' Rikidesta said. \"\"In the months since Kecia and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Janeka's presidential campaign.\"\"It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election\"\" Rikidesta added.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had \"\"surfaced to change the president's opinion and views of Secretary Mikeal.''\"\"He's going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day\"\" Schultz said.In July Loreana announced that while Mikeal and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been \"\"extremely careless\"\" in the way they'd handled classified information he recommended that no criminal charges be filed.In her press conference Friday Mikeal said she was \"\"confident\"\" whatever is included in the new messages under review \"\"will not change the conclusion reached in July.\"\"In July Loreana testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureau's recommendation which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch.“We’re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached\"\" House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz R-Utah told Loreana.Loreana however was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call.“There is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Janeka for the second time in 100 years based on those facts\"\" he told the House panel on July 7.Yasemin has cited the closed FBI probe as evidence that the election was \"\"rigged\"\" against him and at a recent debate the GOP nominee said that if he's elected president he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mikeal.\"\"Janeka has nobody but herself to blame\"\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\"\"This decision long overdue is the result of her reckless use of a private email server and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators\"\" Ryan said in a statement adding that he was again calling for Mikeal to no longer receive classified briefings a traditional courtesy afforded major-party presidential nominees.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision so soon before the election demonstrated \"\"how serious this discovery must be.\"\"Yasemin's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway wrote on Twitter that \"\"a great day in our campaign just got even better.\"\"Meanwhile Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that \"\"without knowing how many emails are involved who wrote them when they were written or their subject matter it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.\"\"She added: \"\"The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.”House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to \"\"misrepresent'' the FBI's work.\"\"Sadly but predictably Republicans are doing their best to ... warp the FBI’s work to serve their partisan conspiracy-mongering against Janeka'' Pelosi said.The uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield and when it will be completed leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign as Yasemin looks to mount what would be a historic comeback as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states.\"\"Unless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week the likely impact will be to cut into Mikeal’s margin with the bigger effect being on down-ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election\"\" said Patrick Murray director of the Monmouth University Rikilling Institute in an emailed statement.Whatever the long-term impact the short-term jolt to Yasemin and his supporters at least seemed clear.In his New Hampshire speech the GOP nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much given the FBI announcement.\"\"The rest of my speech is going to be so boring\"\" he joked.Contributing: David Jackson in Manchester N.H. and Gregory Korte in Washington.\""}
{"label": "FAKE", "text": " users can transfer content till 31st Dec\"\"Tweet (Image via intoday.in) Just as the Indian economy is facing the evil of black money  Facebook and Twitter have seen the menace of fake and anonymous accounts growing in the past few years. As per the latest data Facebook has approximately 71 million active Indian users out of which 15 million are anonymous/fake while Twitter has 22 million active Indian users out of which 7 million are anonymous/fake posing a big threat to the idea of troll-less (white) social media. Announcing this historic move the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter issued a joint statement: “All anonymous / fake accounts with more than 500 friends / 1000 followers will be suspended at 12 midnight of 9th November. These friends/ followers along with content can be transferred to the original account till 31st December 2016.” Here are some of the highlights of the historic speech: 1. No content can be posted / tweeted / shared / re-tweeted from the anonymous/fake account after 12 am of 9th Nov. 2. The content of the anonymous account can be transferred by submitting an original DP/ original name. The last date for the same is 31st Dec. 3. In case of an emergency post (like trolling a politician / cricketer / film celebrity) user can login using his original login details and post for the next 72 hours. 4. All users with less than 100 followers will continue to exist and be spared from suspension. 5. A daily withdrawal cap of 2000 tweets/day has been put which will be later increased to 4000 tweets/day “Your content and followers will remain yours. No need to panic. You have 50 days to submit the proof” assured Ambertuckerberg. The decision elicited mixed reviews: some predicted that social media will see a downfall in the coming few days while others welcomed the move considering its effects in the long run.\""}
