{"label": "1", "text": "\"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCHCENTRAL HONG KONGHONG KONG.Dear Sir Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. ENTITYNAME0 credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. ENTITYNAME1 who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. ENTITYNAME1 did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S! o Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Against this backdrop my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. ENTITYNAME1 so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. ENTITYNAME1 all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind RegardsMr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at BFMaps.com- http://www.bfmaps.com\""}

On June 6 2000 Mr. ENTITYNAME30 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months (being four years) valued at US$40000000.00 (forty Million Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers that Mr. ENTITYNAME30 died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. ENTITYNAME30 did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40000000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law at the expiration of (three) years the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank) I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested please reply immediately via my email address upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses hotels and doing charity works etc)Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )Thanks and regards.TONY SMITH N.BReply me only on this my alternative emailttss7520062006@mixmail.com   \""}

There's nothing new and nothing encouraging inIran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the internationalcommunity which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to theIAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensifyefforts to apply greater pressure on Iran.

I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us. I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been declared \"\"UNCLAIMED\"\" by the chairman and some members of the board of directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever Late Engr. ENTITYNAME46 I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. Engr. ENTITYNAME46 an American citizen was a contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. ENTITYNAME47 has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa. This of course is senseless hence my mission. My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating persons that could be remotely related to Engr. ENTITYNAME47 and we have been doing this for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard. We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30% 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I. I make this proposal in trust and in good faith therefore if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested then please do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way. Thank you and best regards. \""}

The name of the deceased man was(MR.ENTITYNAME55HRANNER from Munich Germany)N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly visit the web site to enable you know whether we can work together below is the website.                    http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmYou have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank management for the annual audit of the year.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after some years the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant (A Banker) we are not allowed to operate any  foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days with your full support.This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any precaution there after.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letterreply to thi box. at;Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfullyENTITYNAME53KAREM AHMEDBill and exchange managerBANK OF AFRICA_________________________________________________________________Personnalisez votre Messenger avec Live.com http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/\""}

My name is dr morries adams a senior Auditing Officerwith the ALL TRUST BANK in South Africa. There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. ENTITYNAME92 a foreigner he was a miner at Kruger gold company a geologist by profession and he died since 1990.      No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$90 million)niety million United States Dollars.      I want to first transfer (US$45 Million)forty five million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am contacting you based on the fact that you are a foreigner because this money can only be approved for payment to a foreigner more so it can not be approved by any local bank here as this money is in US Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a foreigner too.      I know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before however i got your contact from your Embassy's Commercial Attach� I was meant to understand that your race are trustworthy however I did not disclose the purpose of my intention to anybody in the Embassy.Although we will still have to meet possibly sign some agreement before the final transfer of the fund into any of your chosen designated bank account.

{"label": "1", "text": "\"FROM:- MRS HELLEN ENTITYNAME37. ENTITYNAME97U.JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA.Dear Sir/MadamI am writing to you out of a painful heart and situation which our president has caused us the farmers. I know   you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am HELLEN ENTITYNAME37. ENTITYNAME97U the wife of MR. EVANS ENTITYNAME37ETERSON  ENTITYNAME97U who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write to you. Before the death of my husband he was the onwer of (ENTITYNAME97U INDUSTRIES ENTITYNAME37TY LTD) in Zimbabwe a Company which specialize in Agriculture and the Supply of Agricultural Equipments. Before his murder  had taken me to South Africa to deposit the sum of USD$15. Million (Fifteen MILLION   United States Dollars) in one of the private Security Companies as if he foresaw  the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as to avoid more demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland a small country  near Zimbabwe here. This land problem came when Zimbabwe ENTITYNAME37resident MR. ENTITYNAME99RT ENTITYNAME100BE introduced a New Land Act reform which Wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was one of the victims.It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my husband money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa.As his wife I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking for a genuine foreign Account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family or I can arrange with the security company to send the money as a consignment to their sister company in your country for you to go there and sign it out.I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family then the lawyer or consultant will help me and you in opening a non resident account in your name   which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas or you provide your address were the security company can ship it as a consignment to you. This money I intend to use for investment and growth in your country. I have two options; firstly you can choose to have certain ENTITYNAME37ercentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of this money in your country. Whichever the option you want feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the   process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the total money while remaining 70% will remain for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with the above telephone number with which I have sent you this message.Finally please treat this matter as urgent as possible. I am in dire need to leave this country with my family soonest.Thanks for your mutual co-operation.I expect your soonest response.Best regardsMRS. HELLEN ENTITYNAME97U. ENTITYNAME37lease send your response to (hellenpeterson@gmail.com)(For the family).\""}

I have in my possession all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating yourinterest to enable us proceed.I await your Urgent ResponseRegradsMR .RAHA.

It is a crisis President ENTITYNAME14 did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during amajor transition on his national security team. And yet crisis can be a great corrective. ENTITYNAME14 should use thisone to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuationwith military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. ENTITYNAME153 after an extramarital affaircame to light together with expected high-level personnel changes at the ENTITYNAME149 Department and other agenciescreates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor ofnon-military approaches.When he first came to office ENTITYNAME14 seemed suspicious of ENTITYNAME153 who made his reputation under PresidentGeorge W. ENTITYNAME158 as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion wasreflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since thenENTITYNAME14 like so many others seems to have been seduced by ENTITYNAME153. Not by the man but by what the mancould offer him.ENTITYNAME153s unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents amilitary solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For ENTITYNAME158 obsessedwith Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East ENTITYNAME153 helped design a grandiose troop-heavyapproach.With the change of administrations ENTITYNAME153 soon saw that ENTITYNAME14 and his team were different — concernedabout the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while ENTITYNAME153 continued topay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine he veered away from it in practice.

NO FOIA WAIVER.the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to thispresident: targeted technologically advanced secretive killing over which the president could exert control.But such an approach though cheaper in resources and American lives is still flawed. It is still a militaryanswer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history regional andcultural particularism and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and specialops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism the U.S. government remains consumed by thesame old questions: How many men and women in uniform equipped with what kind of hardware need toemploy which tactics to defeat the enemy?What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all theother tools of U.S. foreign policy including information-gathering and analysis diplomacy and economic andlegal leverage.Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastatinglack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan where I lived and worked for more than eight years I wasstunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopulargovernment. So for more than a decade the U.S. government was operating almost blind.The first way ENTITYNAME14 can constructively harness ENTITYNAME153 downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its corefunction: intelligence-gathering. Of late a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA exemplified by thesecretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each dronein the air as has been reported that's 60 who are not on the ground in country interacting with locals gainingan intuitive feel for the dynamics. ENTITYNAME14 should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator atthe helm of the CIA.Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. ENTITYNAME14 should also use this moment oftransition to think through what kind of ENTITYNAME149 Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreignpolicy are multiple varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them the government needs smartadaptable dynamic risk-takers who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must beattracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push ENTITYNAME14 in the wrong direction. The deathof Ambassador J. Christopher ENTITYNAME150 in Benghazi Libya has been politicized in deeply counterproductiveways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.ENTITYNAME150 was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in theregion to which he was posted an ambassador who engaged with people gained insight into the environmentand helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential but it carries risks. If it becomes politicallyuntenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty then talented diplomats will be hobbled.And faced with a choked career path the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. ENTITYNAME14 should appoint asecretary of ENTITYNAME149 determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge ENTITYNAME14 faces in his second term is how to expandrestructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task but one thecurrent crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.ENTITYNAME152 Chayes former special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. of Staff is a resident associate at theCarnegie Endowment and a contributing writer to Opinion.UNCLASSIFarEtiVright 2012 Los Angeles TimesU.S. Department of ENTITYNAME149Case No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.Date: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I write you this proposal in good faith believing that I can trustyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said I havea transaction that will benefit both of us as your assistance is requiredas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank headoffice but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of ourbranch in Kumasi who passed on so that was how I became the presentManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty I discovered anaccount with total sum of $12500000 million that has not been operatedon for the past 4 years.

ENTITYNAME178 another senior partner and veteran of thesuccessful ENTITYNAME14 campaign is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City ENTITYNAME179.Tory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from ENTITYNAME180 who retains close links with the British Tory leadership.He was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor.The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor with the prime minister also understood to beseeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that ENTITYNAME181 Benenson a polling andstrategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. ENTITYNAME14 for the American TV debates is helping Mr. ENTITYNAME78.None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.However it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that issurprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice with Labour and the Democrats retainingclose links.Ms. ENTITYNAME183 is a veteran of Democrat politics beginning her career in ENTITYNAME184's administration and subsequentlyworking as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President ENTITYNAME14 but left latelast year when her husband Robert Bauer the president's personal attorney was unveiled as the incoming White Housecounsel.Mr. Knapp made television ads for the ENTITYNAME14 campaign has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leadingrole in Mayor Bloomberg's three election wins.The pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught with the parties trading blows on allegations ofbullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley.In the latest developments the prime minister Wednesday in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he hadknown about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling his chancellor of the exchequer.In a remarkably frank interview Tuesday with Jeff Randall of Sky News Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in thesummer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway No. 10 had \"\"unleashed the forces of hell.\"\"Mr ENTITYNAME78 said on GMTV: \"\"I was never part of anything to do with this. Look this was the most amazing time.. .and lots ofthings were happening in this time. But I would never instruct anybody to do anything other than support my chancellorand I think Alistair will confirm that.\"\"At a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons Wednesday Mr. Cameron questioned Mr. ENTITYNAME78 on therow.Write to lain Martin at iain.martinwsi.comCopyright 2009 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Box 44252Nairobi.Kenya Email:dan@danielm.orgDear Sir/Madam May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and appropriate shares accordingly.I am ENTITYNAME185 Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6 2001a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy Mr.ENTITYNAME186 made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$21500000.00(Twenty-One Million five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturityI sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a monthwe sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employersthe National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.ENTITYNAME186 died from an automobile accident. On further investigationI found out that he died without making a WILLand all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.ENTITYNAME186 did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documentsincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21500000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servanti cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone numberfull names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested please reply immediately via my email and Upon your responseI shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:Thanks and my regards.

Dear sir/madam              ASSISTANT AND INVESTMENTYou may be surprise to receive this letter from me sinceyou don't know me personally. I am the son of Dr. ENTITYNAME220 who was recently murdered in the land dispute inZimbabwe. I got your contact through Network on line in mysearch for a reliable and reputable person to handle a veryConfidential transaction which involves a transfer of fundto a foreign account and I decided to write you My LateFather was among the few Black Zimbabwean Rich Farmersmurdered in Cold Blood by the agents of the rulinggovernment of President ENTITYNAME198 for his allegedsupport and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition partycontrolled by the white minority. Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg - SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of US$ 18.5 Million (EighteenMillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) withSecurity and Finance Company as if he foresaw the loomingdanger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a Box as Valuables to avoid much demurrage from the SecurityCompany. This money was embarked from the purchase of NewMachinery and Chemical for Farms and the establishment ofnew farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President ENTITYNAME198introduced a new land act that wholly affected the RichWhite Farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the\"\"Modus Operandi\"\" adopted by the government.  This resultedto rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans andsome political thugs. Precisely More than thirty-one (31)people have so far been killed. Heads of governments fromthe west especially Britain and United States of Americahave voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan.Subsequently South African Development Community (S.A.D.C)has continuously supported Mugabe's new land act it isagainst this background that I and my family who arecurrently residing in South Africa have decided  totransfer my Father's money into a Foreign Account. As the eldest son of my Father I am saddled with theresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account wherethis money could be transferred without the knowledge of mygovernment who are tactically freezing our family wealthand South Africa's government seems to be playing alongwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing thismoney in South Africa for fear of encountering the sameexperience in future since both countries have almost thesame political history. More so the South African ForeignExchange policy does not allow such investment hence we areseeking for an \"\"ASYLUM\"\".As a businessperson whom I entrusted my future and that ofmy family into his hands I must let you know that thistransaction is 100% risk free and the nature of yourbusiness does not necessarily matter. For your assistancewe are offering you 30% of the total sum 60% for Me and MyFamily while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we mayincurs during the course of this transaction. We wish toinvest our part of the money on commercial property basedon your advice.Finally all we demand from you is assurance that you willnot sit on this money when it finally gets to your personalor company's account in your country. If this proposal isacceptable by you please confirm your interest via theabove TEL and or E-MAIL me.Thanks and God Bless you.Best Regards.John Carlos______________________________________________________________Herbalife Independent Distributor http://www.healthiest.co.za\""}

The reason why I am explaining  my finding to you is to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes immensely to the actualization of my dreams. On the 18th day of March 2007 we were alerted on the presence of some terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street a long thoroughfare of high-rise buildings built by ENTITYNAME109 here in Baghdad. After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours we were able  to capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al Qaeda and some are for ENTITYNAME241-ENTITYNAME242i and they took us to  some of their hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through the capital. When we invaded into the hideout we recovered several guns amour including some boxes among which two contains bullets one filled with  hard  drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted. I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money to our selves they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that ital&#8482;s no problem. This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place.

{"label": "0", "text": "\"sbwhoeopWednesday August 25 2010 10:52 AMworth reading even if you know the IntelB6H: I'm sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece how ENTITYNAME248 was saved by ISI for example but the ideaof Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sidhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistaniNT aLOSEThe military and the mullahsWilliam DalrymplePublished 23 August 2010The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.It is proving a fatal alliance.It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief ofarmy staff the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure General ENTITYNAME250.For a start the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilianpoliticians guided by their chateau-hopping president ENTITYNAME251 (while minister for investment he was nicknamed\"\"Mr 10 Per Cent\"\"; he has now been upgraded to \"\"Mr 110 Per Cent\"\"). This has led to discussion in army circles aboutwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is thisthreat that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. ENTITYNAME252i editor-in-chief of the FridayTimes went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.\"\"( know this isdefinitely being discussed\"\" he said.Then there was the news that ENTITYNAME253 was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: \"\"an extraordinarysituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it\"\" explained a brigadier writing in the Nation newspaper.ENTITYNAME253 a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO can now continueto run the army and by default Pakistan's foreign policy until November 2013.But ENTITYNAME253's biggest triumph this year arguably the greatest of his career was his visit to Kabul in July as the honouredguest of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations whichhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah SalehKarzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as amujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud the Indian-backed \"\"Lion of Panjshir\"\". The Taliban and their sponsors inthe ISI had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent something Saleh was enormously proud of.When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai'sgovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid arm and train itspuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of directionby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser said when the news broke \"\"it means that Karzai is alreadyplanning for a post-American Afghanistan\"\". •It seems that ENTITYNAME253 and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-sponsored elements in the Taliban maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani which could give over much of the Pashtunsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of IndiaPakistan's great regional rival from Afghanistan or at least the closing of its four regional consulates would be a toppriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly fromAfghanistan andIndia quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror in the early years of this decade India provided reconstructionassistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads sanitation projects the new Afghan parliamentand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As GeneralStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year \"\"while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people increasing Indianinfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures\"\".McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. \"\"Wehave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan\"\" a foreignministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment terrified of the economic superpower emergingto the south believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - apotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital\"\"strategic depth\"\".According to Indian diplomatic sources there are still fewer than 3600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indiandiplomatic officers as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to riskPakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally the US in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership underISI patronage in Quetta - a policy ENTITYNAME253 developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis and hisclear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban therefore represents a majorstrategic victory for ENTITYNAME253 and Pakistan's military as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadimovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin Pakistan's army saw violent Islamicgroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with theretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managedwith great effect from 1990 onwards).The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul who was largely responsible for developing the strategyonce said to me: \"\"If the jihadis go out and contain India tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil for alegitimate cause why should we not support them?\"\" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the BerlinWall presented to him by the city's people for \"\"delivering the first blow\"\" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis inthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his \"\"retirement\"\".The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a tapedconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan his chief of general staff that Indiareleased in 1999 Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their \"\"tooti\"\" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followedtheir own agendas sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders buteven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence againstIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim somuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs publicpromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked onplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai'sregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabulonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. MullahMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb ofPashtunabad. There Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.Gulbuddin Hekmatyar the leader of Hizb-e-lslami was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freelyoutside Peshawar while Jalaluddin Haqqani one of the most violent Taliban commanders was given sanctuary in NorthWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.By 2004 the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering thema few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistaniarmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agenciesconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban turning a blind eye as they raisedfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban with covert Pakistanisupport were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returnedto their bases in Pakistan.At the same time Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified beginning the process of turning theAfghan conflict like that in Kashmir into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twicebombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Researchand Analysis Wing (Raw) the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died inthe blasts.The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear and not just in thedocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard basedon interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders closely documents how the IS! \"\"orchestrates sustains andstrongly influences\"\" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadershipcouncil the Quetta Shura.Meanwhile in the Punjab Hafiz Mohammad Saeed founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba and the man believed to have beenbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke near Lahore. \"\"The powerfulwestern world is terrorising Muslims\"\" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. \"\"We are being invaded manipulatedand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. Infact a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.\"\"At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generousassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both themilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley andannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others inthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas more than 1500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250000people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any membersof the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi in February of the Taliban second-in-command Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded asinfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis without ISI clearance.Yet even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas the seventh NorthWaziristan has been left alone as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly Pakistan'sfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groupsin Pakistan over the past few months show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer the chiefminister of the Punjab Shahbaz Sharif was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in thePakistani Punjab or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still in the eyes of many in the Pakistaniestablishment good Taliban and bad Taliban useful militants and expendable ones.In their eyes the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan with US and British troops suffering record casualties lastmonth is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan andDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south and here India is workingin conjuction with Russia Iran and the central Asian \"\"stans\"\". The Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menonwas despatched to Afghanistan in March and the foreign minister S M Krishna has visited Tehran. Post-AmericanAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtunsouth either formally with a partition or more likely to slip into inter-ethnic civil war with India supporting and armingthe north and Pakistan the south.As diplomacy gathers pace the Afghan Taliban who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue toincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peacefulnorth where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of theBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.In Pakistan. too jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country killing roughly3000 people and the ISI this week stated that for the first time in the nation's history it regarded home-grown Islamicmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In arecent speech ENTITYNAME253 emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy it was against Indian attacksthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis electricity supply increasingly erratic andthe educational system in complete breakdown ENTITYNAME253 has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests inthe region. Worst of all because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph it is unlikely to change its policy anytime soon.William Dalrymple's \"\"Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India\"\" won the first Asia House Literary Award inMay and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury £8.99)\""}

I am Mr.ENTITYNAME255 the son of Dr. ENTITYNAME256who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president ENTITYNAME198 for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President ENTITYNAME198 introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"\"modus operandi\"\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"\"ASYLUM\"\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistancewe are offering you 30% of the total sum60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. This transaction is totally risk and trouble free as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drugs money laundering terrorism or any other illegal act.

But ENTITYNAME315's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting toturn voters' heads in a way that ENTITYNAME174's simply are not.Democratic operatives say that Mr ENTITYNAME316 who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr ENTITYNAME14 willface in less than three weeks is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly differentalternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the ENTITYNAME14 administration.So far the president who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning has been unable to pull that off. Thisweek alone Mr ENTITYNAME316 has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that haveassisted Democratic candidates. Mr ENTITYNAME316 was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattledHarry Reid the Senate majority leader and then move onto California later in the week.\"\"ENTITYNAME315 is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got\"\" says ENTITYNAME318 a political analystat the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"\"He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobodyelse can do right now.\"\" Mr ENTITYNAME316's intervention in Kentucky where ENTITYNAME319 the Democratic candidate is locked ina tight race with ENTITYNAME320 the Tea Party icon is a good case in point.At the weekend Mr ENTITYNAME316 described Mr ENTITYNAME321 who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government andhas talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve as a \"\"radical with no record to back it up\"\". Mr ENTITYNAME321 who has never run forelected office hit back by reminding voters of Mr ENTITYNAME316's former ENTITYNAME322 Lewinsky scandal. \"\"I am not sure I would trust aman who had sex with an intern\"\" said Mr ENTITYNAME321. \"\"I mean do you think he's an honourable person?\"\"Mr ENTITYNAME321's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal thatoccurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets job creation and the absence of foreignwars.\"\"ENTITYNAME315's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage\"\" says Tad Devine a veteranDemocratic operative. \"\"He is also able to enter an individual race take the temperature understand what people arefeeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.\"\"In the West Virginia Senate race where Joe Manchin the governor is trailing John Raese a wealthy local businessmanMr ENTITYNAME316 on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home the former presidentsaid: \"\"I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida tohave three.\"\"Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr ENTITYNAME14 has 29 per cent rating among the lowest in the country MrENTITYNAME316 added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking aboutpolitics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.\"\"In contrast a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr ENTITYNAME14 has framed the midterm campaign shifting from oneattack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month Mr ENTITYNAME14 turned on John Boehner theRepublican congressional leader in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative.More recently Mr ENTITYNAME14 has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money intoattack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. \"\"This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point outhow disadvantaged the Democrats have been\"\" says one consultant. \"\"But it isn't good politics at this late stage whenvoters clearly want to hear about the economy.\"\"Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

Please exercise some patience and read through my message. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1999 a Crude Oil Contractor with the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation Engr. ENTITYNAME324  a national of kuwait made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months value $36MUSD (Thirty six million United States dollars only)in my branch. On maturity we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally his contract employers the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform us that Engr. ENTITYNAME325 died on an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the kuwait embassy were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. ENTITYNAME326 had actively opposed the Government of his country kuwait and was consequently driven into exile. My proposal therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. ENTITYNAME326. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. ENTITYNAME326 nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin and therefore also by this means we transfer this money total $36MUSD abroad for us to share. No one will ever come forward to claim it now and according to South African lawafter 9 years the money will automatically revert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner and certified dead and there is no valid claim. This indeed is the situation. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. Once you indicate your interest I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 14 working days the money total $36MUSD will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Reply to this email:smith_ad505@yahoo.com Yours trulyMr.ENTITYNAME323.\""}

{"label": "0", "text": "To rebuild Haiti start with its young people A 700000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped laborrapidly and instill national pride and confidence.By ENTITYNAME353 and ENTITYNAME354January 31 2010Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake thismonth. The reported death toll has topped 150000 and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about startingwith a 700000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entitymakes a lot of sense.Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% ofthe population.Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopmentand accentuate political instability.Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere Haitian youth are a wellspringof creativity talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they arestifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.Fortunately Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitutioncommits citizens to national service though it has never been activated. What is more there are many Haitian andinternational organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital but also could begin planting trees working the fields andproviding services in Haiti's countryside.At a minimum this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake 50% of youth in their 20s were outof work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring theirand their country's pride and dignity.A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the nextcrisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facingmonumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapiddisbursement transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferringcapital.Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from thebottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes international best practice recommends proposals that promote directmonetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalisticprograms that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards a civic service corps would circumventunnecessary administrative costs.Further a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During pastdecades the state provided relatively few services to Haitians particularly outside the capital. In some cases stateentities were downright predatory. As a result nonstate providers including gangs and shady middlemen filled the gap.A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating thegovernment's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It wouldbe a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path ofhurricanes and on a fault line and can expect more disasters. Training 700000 young people -- especially young women-- in the basics of first aid emergency response community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate theconsequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management the corps could provide more intensivetraining in specialized areas -- engineering telecommunications and public health.An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haitiincluding the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluableexperiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmentalorganization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited andtrained hundreds of Haitian youth including former gang members to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. Thisprogram could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for say up to two years.The Haitian government would of course need to be the one to manage the undertaking with direct oversight from thepresident's office and the Interior Ministry.And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essentialskills.Haiti's youth are the future of the nation and they are central to Haiti's recovery.

The destruction was part ofa larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indianreservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewishsettlers including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after apeace treaty is signed. For now the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase themfrom the map by establishing \"\"facts on the ground\"\" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib'sdemolition here).Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge onfurniture taken from a family's home. [The following four photos are by ENTITYNAME368 of Arab Negev News.One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riotpolice who stormed the village were accompanied by \"\"busloads of cheering civilians.\"\" Who were these civilians and whydidn't CNN or any outlet investigate further?I traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta'ayush an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewishstruggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village's traumatizedchildren helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolishedhomes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib's residents now sleep I interviewed village leaders about theidentity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians describing how they celebrated thedemolitions. As I compiled details the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen 'elders ofthe village I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I hadima. med.Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib familyArab Negev News publisher ENTITYNAME368 supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. Theydepicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions the student volunteers were sent into thevillagers' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteerssmashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they loungedaround on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally according to Matyam the volunteerscelebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.\"\"What we learned from the summer camp of destruction\"\" Madyam remarked \"\"is that Israeli youth are not being educatedon democracy they are being raised on racism.\"\" (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam's Arab Negev News features aphoto of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. Theheadline reads \"\"Nakba 2010.\"\")0According to residents of al-Arakib the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the villageThe Israeli civilian guard which incorporates 70000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli policevolunteers are teenagers) is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state's militaryapparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib tookfrom their experience nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach'adulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military they are learning to treat theArab outclass as less than human. The volunteers' behavior toward Bedouins who are citizens of Israel and serve loyallyin Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth inHebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs rocks and human waste. If there is a distinctionbetween the two cases it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalizeArab property as agents of the state.The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students donot believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed thewidespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel's authoritarian trend. Itwould be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib where adults in heroic warror garbencoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction with even a trace of democratic values.Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move inAs for the present condition of Israeli democracy it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizensagainst one another enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as in the wordsI of Zionistfounding father Chaim Weizmann \"\"obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path.\"\" Historically only failing stateshave encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib from the demolishedhomes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem can be viewed as much more than thedestruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste0...and the destruction begins\""}

KRISTOFJUBA SudanUntil he reached the White House ENTITYNAME174 repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure onSudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.Yet as president Mr. ENTITYNAME14 and his aides have caved leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Westernmonitors Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeplyflawed - yet Mr. ENTITYNAME14's special envoy for Sudan Maj. Gen. ENTITYNAME396 pre-emptively defended the elections sayingthey would be \"\"as free and as fair as possible.\"\" The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurriedreference this week to \"\"an essential step\"\" with \"\"serious irregularities.\"\"President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes againsthumanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party or N.C.P. and he wasquoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: \"\"Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is againstour will.\"\"Memo to Mr. ENTITYNAME14: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America isin his pocket it's time to review your policy.Perhaps the ENTITYNAME14 administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's areasonable view one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues havemanifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism ofthe government.It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanesegovernment gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur allowing me to travel legally and freely.The real game isn't in fact Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-southcivil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005 after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided fora referendum scheduled to take place in January in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They areexpected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of thecountry's oil and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.\"\"If the result of the referendum is independence there is going to be war - complete war\"\" predicts Mudawi IbrahimAdam one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blindeye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.\"\"They're very naïve in Washington\"\" Mr. Mudawi said. \"\"They don't understand what is going on.\"\"On the other hand a senior Sudanese government official Ghazi Salahuddin told me unequivocally in Khartoum thenation's capital that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south willmuddle through and avoid war for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.Here in Juba the South Sudan capital I met Winnie Wol 26 who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the northattacked her village to kill loot rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed but she escaped and made herway to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe Kan. and she had returnedfor the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.Ms. Wol every bit the well-dressed American let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell 400 milesnorthwest of Juba.The trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother who didn't know she was coming - so no one washome. Ms. Wol was crushed.Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother somehow recognizing her and they flewinto each other's arms.To me it felt like a peace dividend.Yet that peace is fragile and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. \"\"I don't wantwar\"\" she said \"\"but I don't think they will allow us to separate.\"\"My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do and that strong international pressure can reducethe risk of another savage war. If President ENTITYNAME14 is ever going to find his voice on Sudan it had better be soon.\""}

{"label": "1", "text": "\"WEST BANK LONDON5TH FLOOR CANNON BRIDGE HOUSE25 DOWGATE HILL LONDONEC4R 2SB UNITED KINDOM.Good dayI am david scott staff of International PrivateBanking at Bristol & West Bank. I am contacting youconcerning a deceased customer and an investment heplaced under our banks management six years ago. Iwould respectfully request that you keep the contentsof this mail confidential and respect the integrity ofthe information you come by as a result of this mail.I contacted you independently of our investigation andno one is informed of this communication. I would liketo intimate you with certain facts that I believewould be of interest to you. In 2000 the subjectmatter; came to our bank to engage in businessdiscussions with our private banking division. Heinformed us that he had a financial portfolio of eightmillion three hundred and fifty thousand united statesdollars which he wished to have us turn over (invest)on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case;I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties asthe de-facto chief operations officer of the privatebanking sector especially given the volume of fundshe wished to put into our bank. We met on numerousoccasions prior to any investments being placed. Iencouraged him to consider various growth funds withprime ratings. The favored route in my advice tocustomers is to start by assessing data on 6000traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managersof alternative investments. Based on my advice wespun the money around various opportunities and madeattractive margins for our first months of operationthe accrued profit and interest stood at this point atover ten million United States Dollars this marginwas not the full potential of the fund but he desiredlow risk guarantied returns on investments.In mid 2001 he asked that the money be liquidatedbecause he needed to make an urgent investmentrequiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom.He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit itwith a security firm in here London. I informed himthat HSBC wouldhave to make special arrangements to have this doneand in order not to circumvent due process the bankwould have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds tocater for banking and statutory charges. He complainedabout the charges but later came around when Iexplained to him the complexities of the task he wasasking of us. Cash movement across boarders has becomeespecially strict since the incidents of 9/11. Icontacted my affiliate in here in London and made thefunds available to the security firm. I undertook allthe processes and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds depositedat the London based security consultancy firm MayfairSecurities Co. Mayfair Securities Co is a specialistprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worthindividuals and blue chip corporations that handlevaluable products or undertake transactions that needimmediate access to cash. This small and highlyprivate organization is familiar especially to thehighly placed and well-connected organizations. Inline with instructions the money was deposited withMayfair Securities Co. The deceased told me he wantedthe money there in anticipation of his arrival fromNorway later that week. This was the lastcommunication we had this transpired around 25thFebruary 2003.In June last year we got a call from MayfairSecurities Co informing us that the activity of thatparticular portfolio. This was an astounding positionas far as I was concerned given the fact that Imanaged the private banking sector I was the only onewho knew about the deposit at Mayfair Securities Coand I could not understand why the deceased had notcome forward to claim his deposit. I made futileefforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passedthe task of locating him to the internalinvestigations department of Bristol & West. Four dayslater information started to trickle in apparentlyour client was dead. A person who suited hisdescription was declared dead of a heart attack inCannes South of France.We were soon enough able to identify the body andcause of death was confirmed. The bank immediatelylaunched an investigation into possible surviving nextof kin to alert about the situation and also to comeforward to claim his estate. If you are familiar withprivate banking affairs those who patronize ourservices usually prefer anonymity but also somelevels of detachment from conventional processes. Inhis bio-data form he listed no next of kin. In thefield of private banking opening an account with usmeans no one will know of its existence accounts arerarely held under a name; depositors use numbers andcodes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank alsogives the choice to depositors of having their mailsent to them or held at the bank itself ensuring thatthere are no traces of the account and as I saidrarely do they nominate next of kin. Private bankingclients apart from not nominating next of kin alsousually in most cases leave wills in our care in thiscase; the deceased died without a testate.In line with our internal processes for accountholders who have passed away we instituted our owninvestigations in good faith to determine who shouldhave right to claim the estate. This investigation hasfor the past months been unfruitful. We have scannedevery continent and used our private investigationaffiliate companies to get to the root of the problem.It is this investigation that resulted in my beingfurnished with your details as a possible relative ofthe deceased. My official capacity dictates that I amthe only party to supervise the investigation and theonly party to receive the results of theinvestigation. What this means you being the lastbatch of names we have considered is that our dearlate fellow died with no known or identifiable familymember. This leaves me as the only person with thefull picture of what the prevailing situation is inrelation to the deposit and the late beneficiary ofthe deposit.According to practice Mayfair Securities Co will bythe end of this financial year broadcast a request forstatements of claim to Bristol & West failing toreceive viable claims they will most probably revertthe deposit back to Bristol & West. This will resultin the money entering the Bristol & West accountingsystem and the portfolio will be out of my hands andout of the private banking division. This will nothappen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to youwill smack of unethical practice but I want you tounderstand something. It is only an outsider to thebanking world who finds the internal politics of thebanking world aberrational. The world of privatebanking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certainportfolios. You should have begun by now to puttogether the general direction of what I propose. Ialone have the deposit details and they will releasethe deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for asfar as Bristol & West is concerned the transactionwith our late customer concluded when I sent the fundsto Mayfair securities all outstanding interactions inrelation to the file are just customer services anddue process. Mayfair Securities Co has no single ideaof what�s the history or nature of the deposit. Theyare simply awaiting instructions to release thedeposit to any party that comes forward. This is thesituation. This bank has spent great amounts of moneytrying to track this man�s family; they haveinvestigated for months and have found no family. Theinvestigation has come to an end. My proposal; youshare similar details to the late fellow; I amprepared to place you in a position to instructMayfair Securities Co to release the deposit to you asthe closest surviving relation.

It was given to me because of my diplomatic status as I did not disclose the actual reasons for which I sought your contact. ButI was assured That you are reputable and trustworthy ifyou will be of assistance. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of President ENTITYNAME198. For his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwe an Opposition partycontrolled by the whites. Before his death he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$38(Thrity-eight million US dollars with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as a consignment to the security company to avoid seizure and also to avoid much demurrage from the security company.   This money was given to my father by president ENTITYNAME431 for investment purpose while they were still in good terms.This land problem arose when President ENTITYNAME198 introduceda new land act which wholly affected the rich farmers and some few blacks eventually vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government. And that resulted torampant killing and mob actions by the veterans and some political thugs precisely more than thirty-one(31) people have been killed.   Heads of government from Western World especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of ENTITYNAME431's plan subsequently the South AfricanENTITYNAME79evelopment Community (S.A.ENTITYNAME79.C) has continuously supported ENTITYNAME431's new land reform act. It is against this background that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa have decided to transfer my fathers's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking an account where this money couldbe transferred without the knowledge of my government who had tactically freezing our family wealth and South African ENTITYNAME429overnment seems to be playing alongside with them We have decided not to invest this money in South Africa for the fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in futuresince both countries have almost the same political history.More so the South African Foreign Exchange Policy does not allow such investment hence I aman asylum seeker. As a business man I should entrust my future and that of my family on his hands I should let you know that this transaction is risk free. we have unanimously agreed that you will be entitled to 30% of the money when successfully receive it in your account. Thenature of your business is not relevant to the successful execution of this transaction. \""}

It will be surprising  to you toreceive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.However I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transactionwhich I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My nameis  ENTITYNAME433 the first son of ENTITYNAME434 of the  most popularblack farmer  from Zimbabwe murdered in the land  dispute in mycountry. As led by my instict I decided to contact you  through emailafter searching  for contacts via the internet as it  is the only meansI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe forsecurity and safety reasons.  However I apologize  if this is notacceptable to you.The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  abusiness venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabweas a result of President ENTITYNAME198's introduction of  new Land ActReform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich blackfarmers and his desire to hold on to power for life  my father for sawthe danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered he withdrewall of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our sharesin major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum ofUS$14.5 million  (Fourteen million Five Hundred thousand US dollars)in a private  security company. This money was deposited with thisPrivate Security  company for safety and security reasons and  was tobe used for the  purchase of land new machines and chemicalsestablishment of new  farms in Europe.President ENTITYNAME431's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  andsome lunatics in the society led to the murder of my beloved  fatherand other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon myinheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for awhile but when the danger became unbearable and I  survived two murderattempts I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlandswhere I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come hereto seek asylum is  because the security company from South Africa hasa branch here  and they have moved the deposit from their office inJohannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an accountand invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits arefugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =financialtransaction this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partnerwhose account this money can be transferred hence this  proposal toyou.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts myfuture and in your hands as a result of the safe keeping  of thismoney. If you accept to assist me all I want you to do for  me is toassist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security companyfrom their office here in The Netherlands as it has  now beentransfered from Johannesburg South Afri!  ca to their branch here. Thecompany will be legally informed of you  representing me.For your assistance I have two options for you. Firstly you canchoose to have 10% of the money for your assistance and helping meopen an account for the money to be deposited here or you can go  intopartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  moneyin your country. Whichever the option you want please to  notify me inyour reply.  I have also set aside 1%($14500000) of this money for allkinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transactionand 4% ($58000000) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10%for assisting with opening an account then 85%will be left in theaccount here for me.Please I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  ofthis transaction.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =December 29th2002 an American contractor with the Government of Ghana Mr. ENTITYNAME474made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months valued atTWENTY TWO MillionFour hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in mybranch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwardingaddress but got no reply.After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employers that Mr. ENTITYNAME474 died from an automobile accident.On further investigation I found out that he did not leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made furtherinvestigation and discovered that Mr. ENTITYNAME474 did not declare any nextof kin in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork.This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. =No one will come forward to claim it.According to the laws of the country at the expiration of 5 (five) yearsthe money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody appliesto claim the funds. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you toassist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michaelcreek so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into thehands of some corrupt officials.This is simple I will like you to provide me immediately with your fullnames and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documentsand affidavites which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shallemploy the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of theWILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administrationin your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will thenfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneousexpenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction as every necessarypaperwork for this fund will be done and my position as the Branch Managerguarantees the successful execution of this transaction.Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.Best Regards.Mr.ENTITYNAME473  --36c3cac6-f322-404a-9058-1e6db6ebf8a3--\""}

PLCCOTONOU-REPUBLICOF BENIN.Branch.This business request may seem strange but I craveyour indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convincedthat you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a moneytransfer.On August 2002 a retired Atlanta physician Mr ENTITYNAME485made a numbered  time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar monthsvalued at nine million pound sterlin(�9.000000) in my branchupon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwardingaddress but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder andfinally we discovered from his contract employers that the Atlantaphysician Mr ENTITYNAME485 and his family died in the planecrash On july 2003.See site below for confirmation of the death.May there Gentle soul rest in peace.http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.htmlOn further investigation I found out that he died alongside withhis next of kin and attempts to trace his further next of kin werefruitless.Since we got information about his death we have been expectinghis extended next of kin (family members)to come over and claim hismoney because we cannot release it unless some body applies for itas next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in ourbanking guidlines and laws but unfortunately  we learnt that all hissupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at theplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. This sum of�9.000000 and the interest is being rolled over with the principalsum at the end of each year . If no one ever come forward to claim itaccording to African law at the expiration of (four)yearsthe moneywill revert to the ownership of the Benin Government if nobody appliesto claim the fund.Consequently my proposal to you is that I will like you to stand asthe next of kin to Mr ENTITYNAME485 and claim this funds so thatthe fruit of the old man's labor will not get into the hands of somecorrupt Government officials.

It will rate high in the annals of thehumanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is alsobecoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit many places arestill largely bereft of international aid.Not through lack of funds supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most ofthe aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels university buildings a supermarket and the UN headquartersall in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas where the damage appears much greater apparentlyforgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all oronly after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake and is not keen torisk more lives.But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trappedand frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.The experience of CNN's medical reporter Dr Sanjay ENTITYNAME490 is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgianmedical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN \"\"rules of engagement\"\" apparently stopped them providing security for thedoctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them to keep them out of the claws of robbers.Dr ENTITYNAME490 and his camera team stayed the night monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenousdrips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. \"\"Outside of a military conflict this is our biggest internationaldeployment since the tsunami in 2004\"\" according to Tony Maddox the managing director of CNN International. So theimage of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American viewof Haiti.CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first fourfrustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is todistribute food because of the likelihood of \"\"stampedes\"\".Nor is the US Government the biggest player in the aid operation doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On thecontrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be \"\"aggressive\"\" he meant it. The humanitarianoperation is not led by civilian agencies but by the Pentagon.Mr Obama ordered 9000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which hascost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it isHaiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.One perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States but more try to come. Every day dead Haitianrefugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollarsthat have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth.Even when the earthquake struck investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds sentto victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in 2008 that have disappeared.Furthermore to the horror of many godfearing Americans voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti. And perhapsabove all Haitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs.The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American militaryinvasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I'd lived and worked there for almost two years as acorrespondent for Dutch radio. There were 20000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception theunarmed Haitians might have in store for them.It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundantconga lines they snaked through the city tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. \"\"Liberte! MerciBeel Cling Dong!\"\" they shouted. A terrified American GI still a teenager saw the mass of pitiful creatures approachinghim and asked me if the tea cosies were \"\"some kinda voodoo?\"\". He calmed down only when a line of BMWs andMitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion.Where the soldier came from the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In Haiti they are likely to be theones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in theslums. For Western city dwellers this is the world turned upside down. \"\"Back! Back!\"\" the soldier shouted aiming hisweapons at the good guys.The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don't really know what is going on. Seventysurvivors had been pulled from the rubble so far the International Red Cross said on Sunday. That's 14 rescues per dayas a joint result of the 1739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump ifsome of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local peopledesperately digging for victims with their bare hands day and night.Let's hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Princedropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced thatthey would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without havingguns aimed at them first.Linda Polman's War Games: The Story of War and Aid in Modern Times will be published by Penguin in April\""}

{"label": "0", "text": "\"sbwhoeoPThursday November 5 2009 12:28 AMHFYI: Decline and Fall of the British Empire 2009 edition. SidFrance: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK inEurope'French Europe minister says ENTITYNAME175's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolatedNicholas'Nat ENTITYNAME505 yVintpur and :15;rattori.c.uardiari.;:o.uk Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMTThe ENTITYNAME506eri?tvea were accused by the French government tonight of \"\"castrating\"\" Britain's position within the EU byadopting an \"\"autistic\"\" approach that would take Britain off the radar.Speaking to the Guardian ENTITYNAME507 France's Europe minister described as \"\"pathetic\"\" the Tories' EU plansannounced today warning they would not succeed \"\"for a minute\"\".Giving vent to frustration across the EU which has so'far only been expressed in private ENTITYNAME508 — who said he wasreflecting ENTITYNAME509rkozy's \"\"sadness and regret\"\" — accused ENTITYNAME332 the shadow foreign secretary of a \"\"bizarreautism\"\" in their discussions.He said: \"\"They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.\"\"ENTITYNAME508 one of the most Anglophile members of ENTITYNAME511rkozy's government made his remarkable intervention after ENTITYNAME512aii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Oversocial and employment legislation the Tory leader said.ENTITYNAME259 said he was not seeking an immediate \"\"bust-up\"\" with the EU and would allow the repatriation of powersnegotiations to last as long as five years.But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP ENTITYNAME514n who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesmanin Europe saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become \"\"self-governing\"\".France's centre-right government condemned ENTITYNAME259's plans saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.Abandoning all diplomatic niceties ENTITYNAME508 said: \"\"It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain so important in Europejust cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the resultof a long period of opposition. I know they will come back but I hope the trip will be short.\"\" He said ENTITYNAME259's approachwas in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament of whichENTITYNAME511rkozy's UMP party is a member.\"\"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence inthe European parliament\"\" he said.ENTITYNAME508 said he has told Hague personally that his position was a \"\"waste of time for all of us\"\".\"\"I have told ENTITYNAME332: go away for two to three years in your political economic situation you're going to be all byyour self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Wellyou go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us\"\" the French minister said.ENTITYNAME508 made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. \"\"It's not going to happen for a minute.Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that\"\" he said. \"\"It is a time of tumultuous waters allaround us. Wars terrorism proliferation Afghanistan energy with Russia massive immigration economic crisis. It is timewhen the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fightingit out on climate on trade on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.\"\"We need to be united otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're bigor small the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance.\"\" He explained: \"\"Finally we haveinstitutional package but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate\"\".In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation ENTITYNAME508 warned the Frenchwould attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn) unlike Britain which receives a rebate.\"\"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think therelationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is ofcourse finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. Thatshould tell you quite a bit huh?\"\" he said.ENTITYNAME259 will be angered by the attack and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the shortterm he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provokecries of betrayal on his backbenches.Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that ENTITYNAME508's comments did not represent the true reception of theTories' plans in Europe.\"\"That is not how we are seen across Europe\"\" he told BBC2's Newsnight adding his party had established good relationswith ENTITYNAME511rkozy's party.\"\"1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals\"\" he added.\""}

I am barrister Kofi ENTITYNAME527mbosolicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr  ENTITYNAME529  a national of your countrywho was in contract with shell development company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999my clienthis wife And their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama express road.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts I decided to trace his last name over the Internet to locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want them to know the true content of the consignment.The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back the claim.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this transaction on youIt is a thing of self  willing nessso it is either you write me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to take because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of somebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very well and you are willing to do this transaction with meget back to me immediately so that we can start as follows:1)I will send to you the contact of the security companythe deposite code for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing.2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven working days to achieve our aim.It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your private telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral discussions and better understanding.While I wait for your reply.Best RegardKoffi ENTITYNAME527mbo.\""}

I am (HASSAN MUSA)The Head of file Department in African development bank (ADB).I got your contact from tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunitywhen i prayed to ENTITYNAME271  about you.In my department we discovered and abandoned Five million U.S.A  dollars (us$5m) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relationto the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that allhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation tothe deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is comingfor it and we don�t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after seven years the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the   business and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i  will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages  indicated.  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communicationand location where the  money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have beenmade for thetransfer.You should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your�s faithfullyHASSAN MUSA.POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to   move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you  finish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well  over this business._________________________________________________________________Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Sid0aptember 26 2010John Rentoul: The party voted for ENTITYNAME66Miliband but got the ENTITYNAME552da insteadNew Labour leader won't stand a chance against ENTITYNAME66CameronThe result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for ENTITYNAME551 would have been one thing. Theparty would have made the wrong decision but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacyunchallenged.Instead ENTITYNAME551 lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college among MPs and among Labour Partymembers but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the ENTITYNAME552da as its leader. He is soft cuddly andpanders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of whichhe was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees Iraq thethird runway for Heathrow: you name it he disowned it. Even in the case of the third runway a policy for which he haddirect ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto which he wrote that he has not been prepared toditch.But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose ENTITYNAME66 Miliband. Labour MPs chose ENTITYNAME66. The party itselfvoted for what ENTITYNAME551 tried to dismiss as the \"\"New Labour Establishment\"\" in other words the supposedly hatedBlairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that although it didn't do as badly as it feared in thegeneral election a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board ENTITYNAME263's warning thatLabour lost because ENTITYNAME176 \"\"moved a millimetre\"\" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument thatLabour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and therefore to do better still they needed to move acouple of centimetres further to the left.They did not think that because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls the next election is in the bag. They knowthat the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They alsoknow that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protestparty and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.That means that ENTITYNAME551 who would have struggled against ENTITYNAME66 Cameron in the House of Commons in any eventis going to be roasted every week.Every week the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of themembers on the benches behind him. Not only that he does not have the support of the members of his party in thecountry. Every week Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and thebeneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.If ENTITYNAME551 had won the party members but lost among MPs which is what I expected the Conservatives would haveteased him in the Commons but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the partyactivists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the \"\"cork-popper\"\" candidate in Conservative HQ. The waythings have turned out that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. ENTITYNAME66 Cameronlucky general faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.Even if ENTITYNAME551 had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college I feel he would have struggledagainst Cameron. This way I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.\""}

{"label": "0", "text": "\"This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me but of course I'm biased.ENTITYNAME562: A New Course for the Middle EastRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength our military strength and the strength of our values.Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt the MuslimBrotherhood has come to power and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability allthe while promising to annihilate Israel.These developments are not as President ENTITYNAME14 says mere \"\"bumps in the road.\"\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.Yet amid this upheaval our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people orour allies.And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout or if Israel's security is compromised America could bepulled into the maelstrom.We still have time to address these threats but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle EastThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role notthrough conquest but through promoting human rights free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries expand prosperity throughtrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.But in recent years President ENTITYNAME14 has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"\"recovery\"\" that barely deserves the name. Our nationaldebt has risen to record levels. Our military tested by a decade of war is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.Finally our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies President ENTITYNAME14 has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presentedgrave risks. We needed a strategy for success but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past fewweeksThe same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"\"daylight\"\" between our twocountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"\"closest ally\"\" in the Middle East to being only \"\"one of our closest allies.\"\" It's a diplomatic message that willbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"\"noise\"\" that he prefers to \"\"block out.\"\" And at a time whenIsrael needs America to stand with it he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In this period of uncertainty we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is both governments and individuals whoshare our values.This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptablethe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity forthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives toextremism.But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength our military strength and the strength Ofour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President ENTITYNAME14 is pursuing.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739629Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

{"label": "1", "text": "\"     =20                     CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSALYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know m=e personally.I got your contact through network online hence decided to wri=te you. I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your i=ntegrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for= foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is ENTITYNAME579=ENTITYNAME580 the first son of  NENTITYNAME580 Banjul one of the most popular black farmer =in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. ENTITYNAME198 introduc=ed a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some f=ew black farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbab=wean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people= were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of= the victims. . It is against this background that I and my family fled Zi=mbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands w=here we are seeking political asylum.Before the death of my father he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit t=he sum of US8.5 million (Eight million Five Hundred thousand United States= dollars) in one of the private security company as he foresaw the loomin=g danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avo=id much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purc=hase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new f=arms in Swaziland.=20Now the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliabl=e foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum= seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transa=ction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands As the eldest son of =my father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreig=n account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my= government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South Africa=n government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the =dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of goin=g through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries= have similar political history. As a businessman I am seeking for a partn=er who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands I mu=st let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current statu=s in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this tr=ansaction with you.=20If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is t=o make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(f=unds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already= given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from= South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place =like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete= arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearan=ce from the Security Company.=20I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage =of the money immediately after the funds hit your account or you can go in=to partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in= your country. Whichever the option you want it is opened for negotiation.==20I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred =in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am= willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for m=y investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the =above email address  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy =required in this transaction.Thanks GOD BLESS YOU=20Yours Faithfully=20George Nduumba.=20Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save =A37.50 a mont=h=20www.freeserve.com/anytime\""}

The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangibleoutcomes that improve their lives.\"\"Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998 Gerry Adams the Sinn Fein president described today's agreement as\"\"yet another good Friday.\"\" After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday the parties in the NorthernIreland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policingand justice powers which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout thesenegotiations.Under the agreement a six-member working group appointed by Robinson and McGuinness will formulate a frameworkfor handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems with the rights of marchers andresidents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks when the Northern Ireland executive will transferresponsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.An executive working group will be set up in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists to improve the way the power-sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrewsagreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish languagespeakers.Ian Paisley Jr the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder described the agreement as a \"\"win forunionism\"\".Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission which most unionists regard as biased infavour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had \"\"no alternative except the imposition of joint authorityfrom London and Dublin\"\".Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice Robinson said: \"\"There are some who will playpolitics with this agreement but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormontthat our whole community identifies with and supports.\"\"Jim Allister the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP said he was \"\"relishing the prospect\"\" of a general election contestwith his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency.\"\"In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondlytheir veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodiesare strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of paradingissues.\"\"Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post\"\" he said.Shaun Woodward the Northern Ireland secretary said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined todestabilise the power-sharing government.He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now \"\"two groups of people who were onceterrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge\"\".But the Real IRA Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In thepast seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations acrossNorthern Ireland.Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policingand justice powers are transferred to Belfast.\""}

DEAR FriendI am the manager of bill and exchange at the auditing of METROPIOLITAN BOND AND FINANCE CO.LTD. in England In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 27.5 Pound sterling (Twenty-Seven  Million-five hundred thousand Pounds sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on Monday 31 July 2000 in a plane crash in paris.Please to confirm my story about the crash you can visit this site:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our financial guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It istherefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release themoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement sincenobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking and financial law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed afterSEVEN years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request offoreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a national here cannot stand as next ofkin to a foreigner.I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account 10%will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me Thereafter I willvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore to enable theimmediate transfer of this fund to your country you must apply first to our security firm here in London because of financial laws guiding this countrywe have moved the money in question to our Security Company Vault here in London for easy transfer of this fund to any where in the world.So i will like you to send tome your NAMETELEPHONE NUMBER and PHYSICAL ADDRESS for easy and effective communication and location where inthe money is bound to.Upon receipt of your reply I will get back to you on the next moves to make.

SidFrsOrn The TimesNovember 3 2009I suggest a night at the theatre Mr ENTITYNAME259A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should beashamedDavid AaronovitchOn Friday morning David ENTITYNAME259 called upon ENTITYNAME93 to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. Theplay was Our Class by the Polish playwright ENTITYNAME609.In a series of short \"\"chapters\"\" ENTITYNAME610nek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.Like the village the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941 as the Germans replaced the Russians as theoccupiers almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. ENTITYNAME610nek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.Though the village is not named in the play it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10 1941. AsPoland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002 on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where one by one they were killed with knives axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from twokilometres away; no one survived.In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans butlocal Poles as depicted in Our Class. ENTITYNAME611 Kwasniewski then the Polish President apologised to the dead Jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne \"\"in my own name and in the name of those Poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime\"\".History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski who leads the Tory-backedgroup in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of21000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart of their political appeal.But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski the MEP for the Jedwabne area did not support the 2001 apology. Heopposed it vigorously associating himself with the \"\"Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne\"\". Among itsleading members were the local priest Edward Orlowski who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the President apologised — said: \"\"These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsibleso why should we apologiSe?\"\"Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper Our Poland themurders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts and that he would only apologise if someone \"\"from theJewish side\"\" apologised for how \"\"the Jews\"\" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month MrKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. \"\"If you are asking the Polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in Jedwabne\"\" he said \"\"you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewishcommunists did in Eastern Poland.\"\"It is this argument that so incenses me•as it would anyone I think who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collectiveJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.Mr Kaminski denied the apology denied the need for it equated the massacre to \"\"Jewish actions\"\" and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns ofmassacre denial: \"\"it never happened it happened but was justified they did it to themselves they did it to us.\"\" MrKaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the lastfew weeks I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr ENTITYNAME259: \"\"Ishould apologise?\"\"But more than that I find myself amazed by how Mr ENTITYNAME259 ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary descended from Polish Jews should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr ENTITYNAME259 hasgot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.Now Tory columnists bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt and to attacking non-existent \"\"smears\"\" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.ENTITYNAME607hy?It is true as embattled Conservatives have argued that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping the EPP and in the socialist group. Butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP forexample is the ruling free-market non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that MrENTITYNAME259 would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping the European Conservatives and Reformists by contrastis all about odds and sods whom a continental ENTITYNAME259 would certainly shun bar one organisation — the BritishConservatives.So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really and that MrKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr ENTITYNAME259 promised hisEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the \"\"federalist\"\" EPP and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.ENTITYNAME607as it all necessary? No. ENTITYNAME607as it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr ENTITYNAME259 doesn't really care enough about Europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sectsthe Hannanites the Cashists and the Redwoodians?This is the kind of advice I loathe but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class Mr C. This is one hole you don't want tokeep digging.\""}

In 2008 the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it wasapproved by the House which passed the legislation again in 2009 withthe support of 10 Republicans.Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts makefor the same work but conservatives have invented a number ofludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example theHeritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurtwomen because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required topay them fair wages. And Sen.

Its revival is testimony to the increasedchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.In the past week North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok or \"\"our nation.\"\"Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named \"\"uriminzokkiri.\"\" The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea a propaganda agency inPyongyang.ENTITYNAME634-ENTITYNAME635 a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul said \"\"It is clear that these accounts carry the samepropaganda as the North's official news media but we have not been able to find out who operates them.\"\"The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korearesumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships killing 46sailors.North Korea which denies involvement has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter andYouTube with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outsideworld.)\"\"YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda\"\" said Paik Hak-soon an analyst at SjongInstitute. \"\"But fundamentally it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash outdesperately in the face of mounting international pressure.\"\"During the cold war era South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years agoduring the brief era of its \"\"sunshine policy\"\" of engaging the North the South allowed its people access to North KoreanWeb sites. But today when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account agovernment warning against \"\"illegal content\"\" pops up.These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their ownopinions about the totalitarian North.But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinkingof the South Korean warship including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in theSouth.The Twitter account which provides links to the North Korean Web site had 928 followers as of Monday. But a fewYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.In one such clip North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan the South Korean foreign minister who recently criticized \"\"pro-North Korean youths\"\" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections saying \"\"If they like the North so muchthey should go and live under Kim Jong-il.\"\"The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a \"\"pro-American flunky\"\" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living \"\"mopping the floor of thePentagon.\"\"Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the \"\"American imperialists\"\" because it was armedwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche or ideology of \"\"self-reliance\"\"; and because of a philosophicaltreatise written by Kim II-sung the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il who died in 1994.\"\"I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans\"\" said Yoo Ho-yeolan expert on North Korea at Korea University here. \"\"People watch this for fun not to be influenced.\"\"\""}

Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS� Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. The money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us expenses too will be shared equally .It is a risk-free deal. \""}

{"label": "1", "text": "\"FROM:MR. ENTITYNAME228EUNG PUIHang Seng Bank LtdSai Wan Ho Branch171 Shaukiwan RoadHong Kong.Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. ENTITYNAME651 director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank LtdSai Wan Ho Branch.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major ENTITYNAME652 who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him even during the war two years ago. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major ENTITYNAME652 did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major ENTITYNAME652 so that you will be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major ENTITYNAME652  all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me 30% for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below(cpui_hsbm01@mail2europe.com) and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.RegardsMr.ENTITYNAME651___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from Fistikmagazin.de service at  http://www.fistikmagazin.de\""}

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.Then after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

This business request may seem strange but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32500000.00) First of all I am an accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria. I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC) I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a  very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons; (i) As government employees we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the foreign firms only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is first to furnish us with the following through my email address.1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )2.) The beneficiary's name3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party.

My father lodged this money in a security company outside our country for security reasons and because of the political instability in my country.   My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before his death. He however deposited this money without any name rather with coded numbers which is in my possession. With my father dead my life was at great risk I therefore had to leave my country under cover to Spain.  Now I have decided to invest this money in a suitable and conducive environment. At this point I now seek your assistance to transfer this money to your bank account for proper use. 20% of the total money will be yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure we might incur in the process while the balance will be for me.

More so we are handicapped in the circumstances as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

Sidhttp://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.htmlEurope's New Politics of Fearby ENTITYNAME697April 16 2010There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities fortheir nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews Roma and gays. In theNetherlands ENTITYNAME698 surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim anti-Quran populism. InHungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on \"\"Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entireworld.\"\" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Itsleaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest'sParliament.Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term \"\"radical populism\"\" but toanyone with half a sense of European history the parallels with an older Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in thefirst half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear isproducing the same toxic politics.The Fidesz leader ENTITYNAME699 was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a muchmore nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is beinghelped so far by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to bepaid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government globalization and international capital was easy.But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right a Fidesz parliamentarian Oszkar Molnar says it's time to give\"\"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital Jewish capital.\"\"Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. TheCzech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader former premier Mirek Topolanek after he attacked the Jewishorigins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book The Populist RadicalRight in Poland the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: \"\"Antisemitism is crucial to thePolish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for ageneral hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy.\"\" For the time being criticism of nationalist politics issuspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto PinochetKaminski uses ugly language about gays and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War IIwhen \"\"Jews apologize for killing Poles.\"\"Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-right European People's Party which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in GermanyNicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France and ruling conservative parties in Sweden Italyand Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago the European Union heldVienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking \"\"Jewishcapital\"\" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe and anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election all the main parties are seeking toappease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens livingand working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe and no one knows how to deal with it.http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.htmlB6EitWhat a Tea Party Looks Like in EuropeMarine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing far-rightparty away from the fringe and redefining French politics inthe process.by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05 2010amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-ReduxMarine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)leads todayJean-Marie Le Pen the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoatefears xenophobia knee-jerk racism and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speakingto the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front partyfeasted on barbecue and apple pie they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth still the \"\"provocateur\"\" tauntingthe establishment the \"\"toreador\"\" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even theseyoungsters knew however that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. \"\"She has the will the courage the temperamentnecessary and the competence\"\" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. \"\"It seems to me indisputable that she is ourcamp's best candidate for 2012.\"\"Tall blonde plain-spoken and thick-skinned Le Pen's youngest child at 42 is the heir apparent to his party. She'sexpected to win the contest for its leadership in January and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strongFrench nationalism relentless Euro-skepticism and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's afresh face a new look and with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates anew threat in French politics. In the eyes of many she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right andcast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left which beganafter his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government dividing their party. But inelections this past March Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. Sohe decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed takingcitizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or \"\"Gypsies\"\")booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls Sarkozy ironically did not. Hisabysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. \"\"I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit\"\" she says.\"\"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father.\"\" The old man could be painted as acreature of the past a purveyor of old prejudices with a \"\"sulfurous\"\" reputation says Marine. Today however the Frontwants to bill itself as \"\"neither left nor right.\"\" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine'srival Bruno Gollnisch) well \"\"tent pis\"\" she says.Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of themthe former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-outbetween Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands the militantlyIslamophobic ENTITYNAME698 won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process oftrying to build a new coalition government.Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usualcaricature of \"\"people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan\"\" Marine Le Pen says and she still believes \"\"the American rightis much more to the right than the National Front.\"\" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiersmore effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligationto help its people. \"\"We feel the state should have the means to intervene\"\" she says. \"\"We are very attached to publicservices A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French\"\" including \"\"access for all tothe same level of health care.\"\"Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks bycompeting factions on the right as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8 someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in thefamily's Paris apartment building. Miraculously no one was killed or seriously injured but the front of the building wasbrought down. The crime has never been solved. \"\"The worst part wasn't just the attack it was that not a single politiciansent a word of condolence\"\" she says. \"\"It was difficult but it builds character it hardens you.\"\"That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidentialrace a year and a half from now he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.With Barbie Nadeau in Rome\""}
{"label": "1", "text": "\"URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Goodday Sir/MadamI am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997 the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54000 in December 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts including interest-bearing savings accounts securities accounts safe deposit boxes custody accounts and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 20000000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).

As of today I would be more than glad if the case of whathappened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuitof the selfish interest of one man the president!After all said and done it has become obvious that my president like anyother African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to notjust consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds thecountry to death by siphoning the money meant for developmentalinfrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do notsee anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind. I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed personbut the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to hisown very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agreewith his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore mustbe purnished. In other words we the followers have come to realise thathe feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the factthat most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware ofthe movement of large sums of money abroad.As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooneror later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition ofmembers of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to anoath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. Thisbeing the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are nowtargets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possibleextermination.I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with youthe possibility of placing some funds with you for management purposeeither in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertakenafter due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon.

{"label": "1", "text": "\"in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. Heinformed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.37 million United StatesDollars which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was theofficer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my dutiesas the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Servicesepartmentespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed and howeverI encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. Thefavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternativeinvestments. Based on my advice we spun the money around various opportunitiesand made attractive margins for our first months of operationthe accrued profitwith interest included stood at this point at over 16.2 million United StatesDollarsthis margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired lowrisk guaranteed returns on investments.In mid 2002 he asked that the money beliquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cashpayments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it depositedwith a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make specialarrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process thebank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for bankingand statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came aroundwhen I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainlandEurope I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a securityconsultancy firm the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts depositsfrom high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuableproducts or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. Thissmall and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highlyplaced and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions the moneywas deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of hisarrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we hadthis transpired aroundbFebruary 25th 2003. In June last year we got a callfrom the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particularportfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned given thefact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew aboutthe deposit and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim hisdeposit.I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locatinghim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days laterinformation started to trickle in that he was apparently dead a person whosuited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes South ofFrance; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause ofdeath was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation intopossible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to comeforward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairsthose who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levelsof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form he listed nonext of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us meansno one will know of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name;depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank alsogives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at thebank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I saidrarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from notnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care inthis case; he died Intestate.In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away weinstituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should haveright to claim the estate this investigation for several months were futile.We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliatecompanies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation thatresulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you beingas a foreigner or rather non-Asian as a potential benefactor of the estateeven if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).Myofficial capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise theinvestigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.What this means with you being a foreigner I have considered the fact thatour dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. Thisleaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailingsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of thedeposit. According to practice the firm shall by the end of this financialyear broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank failing toreceive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to ourbank.This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system andthe portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking ServicesDepartment. This will not happen if I have my way.What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I wantyou to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world whofinds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world ofprivate banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupycertain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now toput together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$15991674(Thirteen million nine hundred and ninety one thousand six hundredand seventy four united states dollars) deposited I alone have the depositdetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to doso.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm isconcerned the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent thefunds to the firm all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are justcustomer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what'sthe history or nature of the deposit they are simply awaiting instructions torelease the deposit to any party that comes forward and this is the situation.This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of thedeceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family buthowever the investigation has officially come to an end.My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction isgiven to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as theclosest surviving relation/associate and all etiquette shall be done inaccordance with the rule of law I certainly can guarantee you that. By thecommon lawthe power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of thelaw and this power has been extended to all a man's Personal and Real estate(Personalty & Realty). There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance frombeing so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir'sacceptance; basically all persons of sound mind are competent to bequeath anddevise real and personal estate excepting infants with all this I would saywe have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation wherebythe paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole\""}

{"label": "1", "text": "\" From;Mr.ENTITYNAME713 and Family          JohannesburgSouth Africa.My Dear Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.ENTITYNAME713 the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our countryin which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our presidentMr.Robert G.Mugabein their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our countrymy father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february2002 in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My fatherduring his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.ENTITYNAME198 and his followerswhich they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enoughthe president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmersalong with the assets of these white farmers themselvesthat are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africawhere we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earthhe had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers awaiting instructions to be moved to its destinationwhich he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my fatherand with the present clamp downkilling and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our countryI therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finallyto the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. PleaseI hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation nowand will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my requestI emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards Mr.ENTITYNAME713 and family.  \""}

In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death we have  been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless   some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank treasury as   unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as  respect to the provision of a foreign account  5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.

{"label": "0", "text": "\"See below. Will send PIR comments shortly.To: CDMFr: ENTITYNAME756Re: ENTITYNAME757 BookOverview:There are few surprises in this book. The \"\"surprises\"\" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pickup on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosedinformation about ENTITYNAME758 (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot ofthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring andmuch more focused on ENTITYNAME757 than I had anticipated. While not as \"\"and this day and the next day\"\" as My Lifeit does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true ENTITYNAME316 fanatic or historian. The fact thatthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. FurthermoreWJC's words are so interlaced with ENTITYNAME757's recollection through his dictations that the number of direct WJCquotes was far fewer than I had expected.HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions withENTITYNAME757 when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past with the exception of theGephardt comment and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC thoughtthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty muchaligned with her interactions with ENTITYNAME757.) Surprisingly or not surprisingly many of the problems discussed inthe book are those which face the current Administration—Middle East peace North Korea China etc...ENTITYNAME757 repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinionof the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example hisconnection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it) but there are some subjects that arestrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising but it did notappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic they just weren't addressed. Much like My Lifeone theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media especially long passagesabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting but youwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and hischronic fatigue with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.The book has quite a bit on Whitewater but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that ENTITYNAME757could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friendslater quashed who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. ENTITYNAME757 doesportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacksWhitewater as a political hunt ENTITYNAME757 does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated fromWhitewater because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye suchas WJC referring to Paula Jones as \"\"a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.\"\"ENTITYNAME757 does not dwell on ENTITYNAME758 or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce Bennett and Kendall noother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into in which WJC says part of the reasonhe didn't mention his relationship with ENTITYNAME758 at first was because she was being threatened with jail time ifshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is avery small passage that could easily be missed but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing thisbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationshipwith Gore which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end and his contentious relationship withJanet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issuesare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayedin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period with ample mention of herrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC both pre- and post-impeachment.On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East Northern Ireland the BalkansChina Russia Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written aboutHaiti is about ENTITYNAME757's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussionabout North Korea but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed inwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life which seems to have more detail and background than thisbook.In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that theUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be \"\"defenseless\"\" flying in whereas Brach writes that the streetswould be lined with \"\"assassins.\"\" There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationshipbetween some such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin'sdrinking such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.One thing to note is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to ENTITYNAME757 intentionally without the recordersgoing but ENTITYNAME757 writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC'sGephardt comment.The following items are addressed in the memo:Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4WJC and ENTITYNAME758's Silence 4HRC and Kissinger 4HRC and gay/lesbian 5Tension with Moynihan 5HRC as World Player 5Jesse Jackson 6Tension with Janet Reno 6Portrayal of Carter 7Relationship with Gore 8Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta HRC and Haiti Invasion ITAV co-author flapSubpoenas of CVC's Friends Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex Gore/HRC ticket WJC suggesting Rubin runfor Senate Trip to South Asia) 11Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime BillIn discussing Wen Ho Lee's release ENTITYNAME757 characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strainedinterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a \"\"confession.\"\" My Lifeonly mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages fromENTITYNAME757's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department after fierce debate among the securityagencies indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to hispersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail lockdownsolitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets toChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored theirtreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. ENTITYNAME316 shrugged. Nothing would please him morethan to establish Lee's innocence. [ENTITYNAME757 577]➢ While Lee was indicted ENTITYNAME757 writes that WJC noted that others \"\"were being held in secret unchargedand untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law withoutforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act any prosecutor should decide within thelegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To hisdismay ENTITYNAME316 had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extremedetention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guiltypeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [ENTITYNAME757 629]WJC and ENTITYNAME758's SilenceENTITYNAME757 writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with ENTITYNAME758 was that it couldsend her to jail as she had denied it.➢ \"\"Also he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail ENTITYNAME758 all year over her sworn denial ofthe affair. If ENTITYNAME316 had come forward with anything at all about their relationship he said Starr couldhave turned him into a witness against ENTITYNAME758 betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties whileoriginal struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for hissteadfast denial nor did he dispute the essential truth of ENTITYNAME758's account.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 511]HRC and KissingerThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling EleanorRoosevelt.➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where hecomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued tosay \"\"it was interesting in fact that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. Hisvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet announcing gladly that his worries were over becausethe ENTITYNAME316 health care bill was dying. 'Oh no Dr. Kissinger' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it'sdead. We'll keep fighting and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanchedspeechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last in Hillary's dream it registered thathis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed'Hillary repeated lost in thought. 'You know I always get my revenge in dreams but never in real life.'[ENTITYNAME757 179]HRC and gay/lesbianWriting about a call with HRC from NYS ENTITYNAME757 recalls how WJC's counsel got very \"\"exercised.\"\" WJC leftthe room. \"\"He was subdued on his return. 'You know I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my lifethan Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative religious core formed before homosexual issueswere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible and she was unsure what heat she could take.On the other hand personal experience could speed adaptation.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 551]Tension with MoynihanThere are several occasions throughout the book that ENTITYNAME757 recalls WJC's grievances and frustration withMoynihan. For example:> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia couldfight for themselves ENTITYNAME757 writes \"\"The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just afreebie for him' snapped ENTITYNAME316 'and he knows it.'\"\" [p.140]> In regard to health care: \"\"Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihanfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme.\"\" [p.170]➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: \"\"She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats and quoted anumber of them. Senator Moynihan for instance publicly said the ENTITYNAME316s were nice people and he wassure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihanskated blithely on the surface never produced results in Congress and could not withstand such scrutinyhimself for five minutes living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the PennsylvaniaAvenue Development Corporation.\"\" [Brach 182]➢ \"\"Donnybrook\"\" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regrettedhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press \"\"He doesn't understand...that he'sconceding the principles.\"\" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the pressand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by \"\"feeding the beast of hostile presumption aboutENTITYNAME316's motives.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 299]HRC as World PlayerThere are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage both with WJC and on her own. Severalexamples follow:➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: \"\"They had retreated for lunch as two couples—theENTITYNAME316s with the king and his wife Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was adelicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The presidentsaid he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders waterdisputes travel barriers war grievances contested airspace sealed electrical grids and so on. Husseingave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 170]> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995 \"\"Her [HRC's] schedule was far moredemanding than ceremonial pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtroddenwomen.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 236] Later ENTITYNAME757 tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. \"\"By contrast witha superficial American press which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance inexotic Asia Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements forcitizenship groups and small-scale economic development.\"\" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds toa NYT article which ENTITYNAME757 quotes in the footer saying \"\"she [HRC] played the traditional role of FirstLady as wife and mother...\"\") [ENTITYNAME757 246]> China Speech: ENTITYNAME757 outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how shedepicted the \"\"harsh reality everywhere\"\" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on therave reviews of HRC's speech. [ENTITYNAME757 289]➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown ENTITYNAME757 writes \"\"Yeltsin seemed so removed fromurgent political tasks that both ENTITYNAME316s counseled him directly.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 512-513]Jesse JacksonENTITYNAME757 writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the ENTITYNAME758 story broke and having continued contactwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCsgratitude but the fact that Jackson \"\"counseled\"\" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.➢ \"\"But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the ENTITYNAME758 news broke he calledChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it wasanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened inAmerican politics. He did not know everything involved but he wanted to remind Chelsea how muchher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all and if she needed to counselrage or pray he was always available.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 497]Tension with Janet RenoThroughout the book from his nomination of her WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negativeopinion of Janet Reno.> \"\"He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear in fact that he felt alienated from his own attorneygeneral. If he removed her however the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy Jamie Gorelick who ENTITYNAME316 feared may share Reno'swholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become atarget...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick to start fresh it would touch off a firestorm of protestlike Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.That was not an option.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 388-389]> ENTITYNAME757 writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato andcontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.ENTITYNAME757 then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her\"\"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit' the president said tersely. 'I didn'thire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'\"\" [ENTITYNAME757398] He continues to outline that ENTITYNAME316 did give Reno credit for some good achievements includingcoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewaterbut that \"\"he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since lettingmandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Renohad failed to defend the presidency itself—not ENTITYNAME316 personally but the institution—and by extensionthe entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered hermore naïve than upright and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 399] He citesthat ENTITYNAME316 warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire secondterm.Portrayal of Jimmy CarterThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip toNorth Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to beon the front lines.North Korea:➢ \"\"On North Korea he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Goreand ENTITYNAME316 had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extremeisolation... Sure enough Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung who proposed to allowinspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official addinggratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White Houseseething but ENTITYNAME316 made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of lettersand he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [ENTITYNAME757162]Haiti:➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break withGore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission toHaiti to seek a truce with the junta Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). Hedidn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea Carter again Carter went tothe press first. \"\"The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday and Carter invited to stayover at the White House called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the nextmorning before he reported to ENTITYNAME316 on his mission. This conduct the president said tersely was notright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominentnegotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment toENTITYNAME316...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president but ENTITYNAME316found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference heallowed exhibiting a keen political ear...To ENTITYNAME316 Carter simply felt that he had earned the right tospeak his mind as an international statesman even about a mission he had accepted for the United Statesgovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn butENTITYNAME316 thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 200-201]Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq➢ \"\"He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent including former presidents Ford Reagan andBush. 'Dole will support me' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes but hedoesn't have much positive to say.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 518]GoreFor the majority of the book there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few placeswhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end however describes theseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.➢ On page 92 ENTITYNAME757 writes \"\"No he [ENTITYNAME316] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy asalleged but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security AdviserTony Lake boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher and disorganized Defense Secretary LesAspin.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 92]➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and alsohaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as othernations were offended that Gore not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan toredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January but WJC\"\"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.`Al' ENTITYNAME316 told him 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Goreerupted. He thought ENTITYNAME316 had lost his bearing. They had a big fight said the president and were stillwrangling about dates for Japan.\"\" ENTITYNAME757 states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC sawENTITYNAME758. [ENTITYNAME757 316-317]➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore WJC et al working asa team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a secondcriminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30000 per month. The conversation isabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. \"\"The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for hiskickoff events—once from Geneva hours later from Paris. ENTITYNAME316 thought the only glitches weretechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himselffrom ENTITYNAME316's personal flaws and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.The president said it was fine for Gore to call ENTITYNAME316's affair with Monica ENTITYNAME758 'inexcusable.'First it was true. Second it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third Gore would bebadgered to death until he did. 'Al' ENTITYNAME316 told him 'if you thought it would help in the campaign Iwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 553-554]ENTITYNAME757 continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of hiscampaign. \"\"On tape the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and toGore's pollster Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood preciselyhow and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him offsubstance.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 554]➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout but it was always framed as his fear of Gore notsucceeding him. For example \"\"ENTITYNAME316 still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smartexperience and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidentialcharacter over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore \"\"stiff\"\" but ENTITYNAME316 discountedthis liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also wasperceived to be too conventional a Democrat therefore lacking independence which called for Gore toemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a broodingquality about him not worrisome or off-putting in itself but potentially damaging if his serious naturefailed to give voters a lifted. ENTITYNAME316 isolated the word \"\"sunny.\"\" Gore needed more of it.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 599]➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. \"\"Gore knew Washington. Believeme said the president his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years hadit not been for the vice president.\"\" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone whowould be a bright spot to run with perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey although he also goes intogreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski even though she would never get chosen. How much of thiswas WJC's emphasis versus ENTITYNAME757's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [ENTITYNAME757 599 618-19]➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. \"\"They should be runningessentially for a third term said the president but they were afraid the ENTITYNAME316-Gore record wouldtarnish them with ENTITYNAME316's character.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 623] ENTITYNAME757 gives WJC's critique of Gore in debatethat had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.➢ ENTITYNAME757 has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where \"\"Gore had bared himself in oneof their stressful consultations by insisting that he Gore was a good politician elaborating that hemeant good on the policy and also good on the politics but admitted that he did not instinctively blendthe two. Gore said he had to think about it and ENTITYNAME316 thought this was pretty close to the bone...Hehad the stuff to be a great president and this was the message that ENTITYNAME316 must convey somehowwithout seeming to brag on his own record.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 623-624]➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. ENTITYNAME757 notes that WJC was unsureat first about recording the details. At the outset it says \"\"For his own part Gore was not angry nor didhe blame ENTITYNAME316 for his defeat but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around himdid.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in theWhite House. Then he says \"\"'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days'\"\"ENTITYNAME316 told Gore 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your messagenow that we're being honest.'\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 642] ENTITYNAME757 recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that\"\"ENTITYNAME316's drag plagued every direction.\"\" ENTITYNAME316 then said that Gore was better at governance thanENTITYNAME316 and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush and that he was an \"\"unparalleled\"\" vicepresident but that he had \"\"blind spots.\"\" ENTITYNAME757 writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was\"\"surreal.\"\"o Gore had a \"\"fresh grievance...he wanted ENTITYNAME316 to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raisingscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personalintegrity but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore saidhe had not been disposed to blame ENTITYNAME316. However he remembered telling the president thathe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And thepresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations fortrouble. So he did blame ENTITYNAME316 in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe theensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election or unhinged. 'I thoughthe was in Neverland' he said.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 643-644]o ENTITYNAME757 continues: \"\"The vice president asked ENTITYNAME316 about Monica ENTITYNAME758. He had supportedENTITYNAME316 all through the impeachment publicly and privately while declaring himselfdisappointed. Yes said the president. He appreciated that. However persisted Gore ENTITYNAME316 didnot confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little tosay ENTITYNAME316 replied beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry had made mistake.He had misled the American people and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.Well he said this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. ENTITYNAME316 did a doubletake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both ofthem angry. ENTITYNAME316 exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significanthere?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayedhonesty that somehow cost the election. ENTITYNAME316's character was at the root of it...\"\" [ENTITYNAME757644-45]Other➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life in ENTITYNAME757's book it has WJC askingMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. \"\"Williams was shrewd discreetand efficient.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 161]> HRC and Haiti Invasion: ENTITYNAME757 asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team'ssuggestion to invade Haiti. \"\"He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against thepressure the lack of options and his sense of being trapped she said he was badly served by his foreignpolicy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—LakeBerger and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby RayInman as defense secretary.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 189]> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator Barbara Feinman a friend of Quinn.HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. ENTITYNAME757 notes that the White House had draftchapters in HRC's handwriting. (ENTITYNAME757 turned this to be about him and how it affected him as aghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a femaleveterinarian of Socks' were \"\"discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757342-343]> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: ENTITYNAME757 tells of how D'Amato as Chair of the Banking Committee hadsubpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records werethere. This included \"\"some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers.\"\" Senator Sarbanes quashed thesubpoenas for the sleepovers. [ENTITYNAME757 362]➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of ENTITYNAME758 ENTITYNAME757 says of Vernon Jordan \"\"In ourglancing associations I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described aslighthearted or recreational.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 495]> Gore/HRC ticket: \"\"By the numbers and ENTITYNAME316's gut a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats theirbest chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down' he [WJC] said tut I don't think Alwould ever do it.'\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 540]> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supportingHRC if she decided to run which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether thetwo events are unconnected. \"\"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win theNew York Senate seat Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now...\"\"[ENTITYNAME757 557]➢ On trip to South Asia: ENTITYNAME757 says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh because \"\"of hardintelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 594] My Life discussesthe cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.DI 'Gephardt is an asshole\"\" Hillary commented. The president pointing to my recorders advised gently that the tapes were on. Shewinced but shrugged with a smile. \"\"Well he is\"\" she insisted. In an awkward silence I backed up both machines to erase the firstlady's epithet.\"\" [ENTITYNAME757 263]\""}

{"label": "0", "text": "\"Cc: Berger ENTITYNAME774 R.HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over thePakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more andwhile I have no silver bullet here are some further thoughts.-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target someAQ in Pakistan and that where they hold back it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and moreabout with whom AQ is imbedded..-- In particular they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they wantto cultivate in the event we \"\"leave\"\" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen thatbefore and will hedge their bets.-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we candisabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan it will be easier to get the Pakistanisto go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistandominated by the Taliban.-- Second I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted againstmilitary leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence wecan go after bank accounts travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers raisingthe stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Bluntermeasures of coercion like conditioning our assistance are more likely to be counterproductive. Giventhe level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people they would see this as another sharp swing ofthe U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult forthe Pakistani people to accept.-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Ofcourse the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list thesedays but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting oureffort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time we can be asforward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment trainingwhatever material intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step we can do all that is possible todemonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..-- On the civilian side their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used canbe played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the useof these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to pressthem on AQ.-- Finally there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could takethat would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus onthreats to the East including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidencebuilding measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduceuncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy?To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants they couldsee such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.Sandy\""}

These dissidents willcontinue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge ofbringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there ispolitical stability.\"\"The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to theGuardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the DemocraticUnionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the Britishgovernment has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state ENTITYNAME27ENTITYNAME316 wrote to ENTITYNAME259 after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubtsabout endorsing the deal. ENTITYNAME316 is said to be alarmed that ENTITYNAME259 has either failed or not bothered to warnthe UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.A Tory source said: \"\"David ENTITYNAME259 has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing andcriminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details arefor the parties in the executive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now andTuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.\"\"The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was thelargest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalistand Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet hisparty's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assemblymembers account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote fromthe UUP seen as a moribund force until ENTITYNAME259 breathed new life into it would destabilise many members ofthe DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.\""}

LTD.IDUMOTA BRANCH LAGOS. - NIGERIA.Dear SirI am Mr ENTITYNAME401alada Hart Bank Manager of Orient Bank of NigeriaLagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On September 6 1997 a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. ENTITYNAME776 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$25000000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. ENTITYNAME776 died from an automobile accident. On further investigation I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. ENTITYNAME776 did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25000000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. ENTITYNAME776 so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.Thanks and regards.Mr.ENTITYNAME401alada Hart\""}
{"label": "0", "text": "\"sbwhoeopSaturday January 9 2010 9:42 AMH: Succinct summary on NI situation at this moment. Details to follow later. SidJanuary 92010The First Lady her young lover and a scandalthat could hand power to Sinn FeinDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences ofENTITYNAME779 ENTITYNAME780's infidelityThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulfBelfast's frail political settlement last night.Following a day closeted with advisers ENTITYNAME600 head of the Northern Ireland government broke his silence toinsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiryinto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party the DemocraticUnionists (DUP) are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavyemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in thecoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Feinbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting thepeace process in jeopardy.Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife ENTITYNAME779 who has exited from public life led to a day-long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the ENTITYNAME780 family.Mr ENTITYNAME780 stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactionswithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old \"\"toyboy\"\" lover to set up a business.Mr ENTITYNAME780 said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel \"\"to ask me any questions he or she wishes toask and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation\"\".Insisting he had done nothing wrong Mr ENTITYNAME780 accused the BBC of broadcasting \"\"smears and innuendo\"\". Saying thathe did not rule out a defamation action he declared: \"\"I am being tried in the court of public opinion.\"\"Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness who is Deputy First Minister said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seekingtalks with both Mr ENTITYNAME780 and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandalbroke but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr ENTITYNAME780 may not survive thestorm.Mr ENTITYNAME780 who has been First Minister for 18 months is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since hewas prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr ENTITYNAME780 has resisted pressure fromalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing fromLondon to Belfast.His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents inthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to thefamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.In recent days Mrs ENTITYNAME780 dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP foreast Belfast a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediatelyand stop drawing her salaries.These reflected the fact that while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival her behaviour is regardedas inexcusable.She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father Billy. Before he died he asked Mrs ENTITYNAME780 to look after his son. TheBBC programme Spotlight revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said shesuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council where she is analderman.She is said to have obtained £50000 from two property developers to be used to set up the business. She is also said tohave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it wasinvestigating.The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs ENTITYNAME780's one-time political adviser Selwyn Blacka former Methodist minister who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs ENTITYNAME780.Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice a hardline critic of MrENTITYNAME780. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed \"\"with utter transparency and candour\"\".Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs ENTITYNAME780's immediate resignation saying: \"\"It is clear that ENTITYNAME779ENTITYNAME780's continuing position as an MP Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all herpositions with immediate effect.\"\"He added: \"\"It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party willstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct ofthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against theFirst Minister.\"\"* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr ENTITYNAME780's future.But he said: \"\"It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing thepolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.\"\"And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deepfreeze even some may wish to unpick they would be extremely irresponsible foolish and would be playing very verydangerous games.\"\"Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunityto clear his name.But he went on: \"\"I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening he is First Minister and the business ofdevolution the business of the Executive must go on.\"\"I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continuesand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.\"\" PA\""}

Have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated after end of this financial year. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same citizenship with him so that the proceeds of this account valued at $16.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money.60% to me and 30% to you while 10% is for expenses. I have all necessary Information that can be used to back up any claim we may make.

{"label": "1", "text": "\"Dear Friend.Attention PleaseI am ENTITYNAME828 the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen MillionFour Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills while 50% will be for me.  Please you have been adviced to keep \"\"Top Secret\"\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communicationYours faithfullyGeorge Path.\""}

The funds came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry.The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$60000000.00 (Sixty Million United States Dollars).But in the course of negotiation between my board and the contractor to our benefitthe contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$40000000.00(Forty Million United States Dollars).This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministrywhere our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval/disbursement. As a civil servant still in active government serviceI am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of South Africa.Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present you or your company as the second contractor of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractorto enable me transfer the difference of US$20000000.00 (Twenty Million United States Dollars)into your provided account.

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious couldcome into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept itwith a deep sense of humility.      My name is NELSON  ENTITYNAME695ENRY. I�m a 65 years old man.  I am British living in Trinidad and tobago(south america).   I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Kuala lumpur(Malaysia).  I was also married with two children.  My wife and two children died in a car accident three years ago.   Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for.  I never really cared about other values in life.   But since the loss of my family I have found a new desire toassist helpless families.      I have been helping orphans in orphanage/ motherless homes.     I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan South AfricaCameroon Brazil Spain Austria Germany and some Asian countries.  Before I became ill I kept $15 Million in a long-term deposit account in aFinance/Secutity company.      Presently I�m in a hospital where I have been undergoing  treatment for esophageal cancer.     I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctorshave told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wishto see this money distributed to charity organizations.  Because relativesand friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness I cannotlive with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.     Please I beg you in the name of ENTITYNAME41 to help me collect the deposit andthe interest accrued from the company.      Distributes it amongst charity organizations.     Use your judgment to distribute the money and feel free to reimburseyourself when you have the money for any cost you incure during theprocess of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. .     I�m willing to offer you a ! Reward if you are willing to help; pleasereply as soon as you can.     May the good Lord bless you and your family.  Regards.

I am MrTONY SMITH  the Director in charge of Audit/Accounts unit Foreign Remittance Department of AMLGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA(ABSA). Your contact is courtesy of Business online network via Internet as I decided to contact you for this beneficial transaction that is   100% risk free.During auditing verifications/investigations in our bank at the end of last fiscal (financial) year I discovered the sum of (US$17.5M}SEVENTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS in a dormant account belonging to an  Australian international businessman who died along with his family in the November 5th2001 plane crash in Abidjan west Africa. Our investigations revealed no survival or NEXT OF KIN/RELATIONS for claims as we have long been expecting someone to forward applications for claims as it applies to our banking  regulations. Information / verifications from reliable sources confirmed that his supposed ?NEXT OF KINS? died with him in the crash. Hence this for your perusals.However I kept this information (SECRET) confidential within my jurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through trustworthy person whom we shall present to our bank as the BONAFIDE ?NEXT OF KIN? to the deceased. We intend to credit this fund into any of your nominated (designated) offshore bank account for investments.Meanwhile all domestic arrangements for claims has been put in place awaiting your acceptance to participate. I will give you directives and all needed  information as soon as I receive your positive response.Kindly understand that we could not carry out this on our own as based on the simple facts that we are civil servants and secluded from operating foreign account and too it will raise eyebrows on our side in terms of transfer being staff of the bank. Moreover this fund belongs to a foreigner and demands same as next of kin to claim it. Hence your contact for   successful operation. My colleagues and I has resolved to offering you 20% of the total sum as commission We will invest 75% of our share in your country provided it is profit oriented. 5% of the total fund will be set aside to re-emburse all expenses to be incurred in the course of  running this transaction such as telephone and other minor expenses.

Therefore be kind to clarifythe following for my consideration:1. Can your account accommodate this fund in your local bank without government intervention or do you have an account outside your country where you may consider safe for this fund ?.2. What are taxation in your country like as I desire a low/free tax zone?.3. What are the interest rates on long/short term fixed deposit in your local banks?.4. What other lucrative investments would you suggest as I intend banking real estate and hotels if they are good business venture in your Country?.5.

Hence out ofcuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box thatwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained aconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting toabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have beennursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and theforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from hiscountry while he was in office as Prime Minister It is my convictionthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that ourclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to thismoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).Finally I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assistme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country forimmediate investment.

To this effect they can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin as indicated in our banking guideline.  At this juncture i have decided to do business with you in collaboration with some officials in the bank to this effect we solicit your assistance in applying as the next of kin and beneficiary to ENTITYNAME863ve ENTITYNAME864udes then the money will be released to you. As we do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed billor our superiors taking the funds for their own personal use.The banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed for a period of up to seven years(7yrs) the money will be transferred into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. Our request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the decease The fund shall then be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down procedures governing closure of account and transfer of funds.

{"label": "1", "text": "\"Dearest in the ENTITYNAME869Greetings to you and your family I am Mrs ENTITYNAME865LLARAN NENITA from Philippines. I am married to Mr. ENTITYNAME28RIO NENITA who worked with Philippines embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002.He is also a well known fruits import and Export business man in Ivory Coast. We were married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.6Million US dollars with a bank in Ivory Coast Presently this money is still in the custody of the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem.Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or better to a Christian individual or a good Muslim personality that have a humanity understanding and trustworthy that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or an individual personality that  is trustworthy  to use this money for orphanages widows propagating the word of ENTITYNAME41 and to endeavour that the house of ENTITYNAME41 is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that \"\"Blessed is the hand that giveth\"\". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the ENTITYNAME869.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that \"\"the ENTITYNAME869 will fight my case and I shall hold my peace\"\". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development as I am convinced that With ENTITYNAME41 by my said all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Ivory Coast I will also send a copy of my passport to you and my photo and also issue you an authority letter that will empower you to be the beneficiary of the money. I want you and your church to always pray for me because the ENTITYNAME869 is my shepherd and he shall see us through My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian so I have no fear at all for I am convinced that ENTITYNAME41 is with me and he shall be with you if you make yourself available to take up this spiritual project of ENTITYNAME41.I believe that whoever that wants to serve the ENTITYNAME869 must serve him in spirit and Truth thus I took this decision. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on this email address always and please be informed that any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.Hoping to receive your reply.Remain blessed in the ENTITYNAME869.Yours in ChristMRS ENTITYNAME865LLARAN NENITA\""}

{"label": "1", "text": "\"My DearI greet you in the name of our lord ENTITYNAME871. My name is Mrs.ENTITYNAME872 I am a widow and a mother of three all girls. I know you will see my letter to you as an embarrassment considering the fact that we do not know ourselves. I plead with you to be patient with me I feel very pleased to contact you for some assistance and business relationship. I live in Nigeria with my children. My late husband was a loving caring and hardworking businessman who died unfortunately In a ghastly auto crash. Before the sudden death of my beloved husband and father of my daughters my late husband intended to establish a business in the united states of America with the sum of$30 million united states dollars but unfortunately he died before this proposed venture. Following his death his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my offspring's all girls as I do not have a male child for my husband. Well according to some barbaric traditional laws here in Nigeria (Africa) which doesn't permit a woman to inherit a man's property as they are expected by tradition to take over the management of his business and other properties including myself who automatically becomes a wife to one of his immediate brothers. Unfortunately to this wicked family members the $30million united states dollars which my late husband intended to use in establishing a business in the United States was deposited in a bank account unknown to his family . I and the lawyer is the only one aware of this money so I have discussed this matter with a staff of the bank that i want this money personally so that I will be able to take care of my children's educational needs since my husband's family members vehemently opposed the furtherance of their education. According to the staff of the bank the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money to a bank account outside Nigeria For safe-keeping later it will be used for business establishment subject to the Advise of whosoever finally assists us. At this juncture I there fore ask for your sincere assistance in providing us with your bank details and the enablement to facilitate the remittance of this fund into your nominated account. As soon as I get your positive response I shall provide you with all the necessary detail for this transfer. However I have decided to to give you 20% of the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 65% of the money will be for my investment as I will want to keep aglow my late husbands dream of investing in real estate. To be able to help me kindly send through my email your personal details including your contact information for easy communication. Thanking you for your anticipated response Mrs. ENTITYNAME872. \""}
{"label": "1", "text": "\"Good DayWith warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy if this contact is not acceptable to you as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is ENTITYNAME873 I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late ENTITYNAME874 leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct I selected your email address from an internet directory in my search for a partner hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola led by President ENTITYNAME875 on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death Mr. ENTITYNAME876 who was his second in command assumed office as leader of UNITA due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in ENTITYNAME877mbo there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like ENTITYNAME878 lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions including Mr.ENTITYNAME877mbo planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. ENTITYNAME877mbo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now not so much of the struggle interested me anymore as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million) which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo ENTITYNAME875 has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Also ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security company after which the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance I will reward you with 15%($2775000) of the money. I have with me the Certificate of ENTITYNAME877posit for the safety deposit which will be used for claim from the security company and the release codes of the vaults. Also everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerelyO.C.Savimbi.\""}

{"label": "1", "text": "\"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCHCENTRAL HONG KONGHONG KONG.Dear Sir   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. ENTITYNAME0 credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. ENTITYNAME1 who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. ENTITYNAME1 did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop my suggestion to you is that I will like youas a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. ENTITYNAME1 so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. ENTITYNAME1 all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bankaccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me 25% for you and 5% for anyexpenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind RegardsMr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site torrentgods.comr- http://torrentgods.com\""}

S14 16 2010 11:01 pmENTITYNAME889 Barred From West Bank by IsraelBy ROBERT MACKEYENTITYNAME885 an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel was denied entry into the WestBank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver alecture.ENTITYNAME888 of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:No reason was initially given for the decision but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridgeborder crossing from Jordan had misunderstood ENTITYNAME889's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.ENTITYNAME889 who is on a speaking tour in the region was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank onMonday.A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and \"\"officials weretrying to get clearance from the Israeli military which controls access to the West Bank to allow ENTITYNAME889 to enter.\"\"In a television interview from Amman Jordan after he was rebuffed Mr. ENTITYNAME889 told Al Jazeera English \"\"the facts werecompletely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.\"\" He explained that he was interrogated forseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-old scholar added:I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — hewas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One wasthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I supposeevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking aninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities as I have done many times in the pastbut not this time.Mr. ENTITYNAME889 had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at thePalestinian university in Ramallah.The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza which ended in January 2009 andhas criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003 Mr. ENTITYNAME889 said \"\"I objected to thefounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would objectto the United States as a Christian state.\"\" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. ENTITYNAME889 on his opposition to Israel saying\"\"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew\"\" he replied:It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italiancriticized Italian policies would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?• Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company• Privacy Policy• NYTimes.com 620 Eighth Avenue New York NY 10018\""}

I am former Mrs. ENTITYNAME914 now I am Mrs. Mary ENTITYNAME914 a widow to Late Dr. ENTITYNAME916. I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So I now decided to divide part of this wealth by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America Canada Africa Europe and Asian Countries. This mission who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it I am willing to donate the sum of $7300000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country and i have map out $1700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.  Please note that this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped. Lastly I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without ENTITYNAME41 one's life is vanity upon vanity.

We will askthe Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the ForeignPress Center early this week which will attract a good number of Asian journalists and make sure the question is askedso we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJBEGIN TEXTQuestions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State ENTITYNAME283 on September 30 before the UnitedNations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statementshe said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries including Sri Lanka.Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficultconflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) stretching into thisdecade the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape andsexual violence in Sri Lanka particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This wasthe basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time in the most recent phase of the conflict from 2006 to 2009though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings disappearances and mistreatment ofdetainees we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war as they clearly have inother conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of themilitary conflict Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on thepromotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250000displaced persons who are still confined in camps and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. TheUnited States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges."}

{"label": "1", "text": "\"                      Dear Sir Dearest Valued FriendIt is with deep sense of honor and respect that I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that any fact/s or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. If it does not interest you discard the mail but if it makes sense to you I open my arms wide to do business with you.I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation with co-operation of two other top officials we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41500000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general and foreign direct investment in particular are the real engines for sustainable economic development for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them so as to continue to enjoy close relationship and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70% and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal. Please send all correspondence to and response to potobo3@netscape.net RegardsEngr Paul O. Otobo.potobo3@netscape.net\""}

On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48223000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account. I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular.  I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account  no beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account. I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction. At the conclussion of this transaction your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages.

The There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 but since the Death of the account owner ( Mr. Eshed.B.Willey ) no surviving beneficiary has come forth to claim this fund.After going through some old files in the bank for the first quarters of the year I discovered that if this fund is not Remitted out of this country immediately it will be forfeited for noting or better described as�� retired account�� by Board of Directors of the bank who actually will use this fund in enriching a few already Over-rich bank owners. On further investigation I discovered that even the company (ORIENTAL DIAMOND COMPANY. S A) where the late account owner who was a foreigner worked as a miner/geologist have no knowledge of the existence of this account or about the fund involved is USD 52M (Fifty two Million Dollars) Only.As the money is in US Dollars account and can only be approved to a foreigner with some required information as the next of the kin I am contacting you to establish a relationship and possible transfer of this money into your nominated bank account outside South Africa. Also everything concerning the payment and transfer of this fund would be done legally with all the necessary documentation work for the process and submitted to the bank to enable the payment into You�re nominated bank account.It is very essential that I have your full co-operation/undivided commitment to make this noble transaction be successful as the management of the bank is prepared to approve the remittance of this fund to any foreigner who comes forth as the beneficiary.

I am Mr    Arbu  Mpula the son of Dr.Henry  Mpula who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.I got your contact through South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) in Johannesburg and I decided to solicit for your assistance. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold  blood by the agents of the ruling government of president ENTITYNAME198 for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death he had taken me to  Johannesburg- South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 23.Million(Twenty three Million  United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he Foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.The money was deposited in a metal box and declared as a personal effects for the use of some of his friends who were to arrive for the world conference on racism scheduled to hold in South Africa from fromr 1st  march 2003.This money was given to my father by President.ENTITYNAME198 himself for investment in South Africa when they were in good terms. The dispute between my father and the President arose when the President introduced a new land reform-act which adversely affected the rich white farmers and so  black farmers as well.    My father was vehemently opposed to the \"\"modus operandis\"\"adopted by the government and publicly oppose it. This brought him in direct conflict with the president. To achieve his purpose the president used war veterans to plunder loot and occupy all farms belonging to the white farmers and their black sympathizers. More than Fifty Farmers has lost their lives so far. Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced there condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously Supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently Residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest Son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility Of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money Could be transferred without the knowledge of my Government who are tactically freezing our family Wealth and South Africa's government seems to be Playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of Encountering the same experience in future  since both Countries have almost the same political history.so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an \"\"assylum\"\".

Op-Ed ContributorGermany in Need of a DreamBy JOHN KORNBLUMHas Germany abandoned Europe? Do ENTITYNAME960's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is nolonger the motor of European integration? Has ENTITYNAME961 in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the FrauleinGermania of 2010 as Germany's own former foreign minister ENTITYNAME962 has suggested?As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany myBlackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:Germany has changed very little but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945 but trauma remains a defining issue for Germansociety. Sixty five years later Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability respectability andpeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solelywithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did notremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany sometimes over the opposition ofothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushedthem with determination.ENTITYNAME963hl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a commoncurrency but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark for decades the European monetary standard. The eurostability pact now the object of so much controversy with Greece was the result. After 1990 the E.U.'s eastwardexpansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.Slowly and without fanfare Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the wayGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused byGermany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded inpursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his but it almost always left leadership to others.A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \"\"Europe\"\" in the institutional sense has becomeincreasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the GermanConstitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance toGreece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German TeaParty?Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the \"\"motor of Europe.\"\" Ms. Merkel'sunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many it signified the decline of Germanwillingness to \"\"salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag\"\" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot but they happen to be the only ones whocan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption thatcharacterizes many E.U. programs.Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them the question iswhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so surethat its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to aglobalized world.And so when ENTITYNAME960 raps Greek knuckles she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not thatGermany is dangerous; even worse that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many otherswhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning toburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense ofcommon purpose the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselvesoften tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200000 of them were waiting to hear when theyrallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \"\"Dare to Hope\"\" which is thecharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. Americaseems busy elsewhere.The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building ademocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting tohaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big forGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works the United States will bejoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space within which modern democratic values will harnessmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will beassured.European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream andthe United States is too busy to try we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up itsside of the bargain Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.John ENTITYNAME957 senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin served as the U.S. ambassador toGermany from 1997 to 2001.\""}

But this mail comes from a devastated sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone dies someday.My name is ENTITYNAME967 a merchant in Dubaiin the U.A.E.I worked with Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources for eight years as a contractorI have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatmentI am very worried as the doctors have informed me that its terminal.I don't know how much time I have left on earth hence this mail to you.I have not particularly lived my life  well as I never really cared for anyone but mybusiness. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when ENTITYNAME41 gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that ENTITYNAME41 has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want ENTITYNAME41 to be merciful to me and accept my soul hence I decided to give alms to charityorganizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.EAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be content with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $1800000000 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.ENTITYNAME41 be with you.Reply to:naybet@web-mail.com.arENTITYNAME967>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>FREE Email?

The Chinesecompany will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday in LausanneSwitzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that coversa 90 percent stake in the project.A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still Tehran's motivation for releasing thisinformation in English at this time is worth considering.The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below and I found three Chinese-language sourceswith corroborating reports (nothing in English from China though):http://business.sohu.com/20090929267094148.shtmlhttp://money.163.com/09/0929/14/5KCSKN5F002524SO.htmlhttp://finance.sina.com.cn/world/gjjj/20090929/18566807524.shtmlJackiePress TVIran China sign a major oilfield dealMon 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMTChina National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for thedevelopment of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday inLausanne Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.CNPC which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield now holds a 70 percent share of the projectwith NICO holding 20 percent and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260000 barrels of crude oil per day and its development will costaround $2.5 billion.The field along the Iraqi border holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil one of the world'slargest finds in the last 30 years.Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.The deal is couched in buy-back terms in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC afterdevelopment and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries led by the US have sanctioned Iranover its peaceful nuclear program.Jacqueline NewmyerPresident Long Term Strategy Group12 Eliot St. Cambridge MA 02138617-661-1620 (ph)617-661-1626 (fax)www.ltstrategy.com"}

Triple checking the origins.ENTITYNAME283 Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'Originally posted Friday August 21 2009 12:30 PM EDTSecretary of State ENTITYNAME283 may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week but last week the formerFirst Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about ENTITYNAME315'sthoughts on a trade issue (\"\"My husband is not the secretary of state I am\"\" she retorted) the emotional heart of hertour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma inside the war zone in eastern Congo where she tearfully met rapevictims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com Secretary ENTITYNAME316 shares what she learned on her visit -and what she will do about it.What I Saw in GomaBy Hillary Rodham ENTITYNAME316In 11 days of travel across Africa I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week I saw both.The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma aprovincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violentconflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informalmilitias these men women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safehaven.Now they live in tents one next to the other row after row some clinging to life others hanging on to whateverglimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of theirhomes possessions families and worst of all their dignity.Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale as sexual and gender-based violence hasbecome a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1100 rapes are reported each month with anaverage of 36 women and girls raped every day.I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two oftheir children and shot them in the front yard before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Thenthey beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managedto get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them andabet them. They are crimes against humanity.These acts don't just harm a single individual or a single family or village or group. They shred the fabric that weaves ustogether as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen healthcare workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the woundedin Goma I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who havebeen raped often by gangs and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children or walk or work.Caregivers like Lyn Lusi who founded Heal Africa in Goma and Dr. Denis Mukwege who founded the Panzi hospital inBukavu represent humanity at its best.The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding toprevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical carecounseling economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officersto protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women andfront-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. Andwe will deploy a team of civilian experts medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assistsurvivors of sexual violence.While I was in the DRC I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that theperpetrators of these crimes no matter who they are must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly importantwhen they are in positions of authority including members of the Congolese military who have been allowed to committhese crimes with impunity.Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma and it will notend with my departure.We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in theeastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring anend to this conflict.There is an old Congolese proverb that says \"\"No matter how long the night the day is sure to come.\"\" The day mustcome when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again to tend their fields play with their children andcollect firewood and water without fear.
